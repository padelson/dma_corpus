accepted pursuant to the Offer will thereupon be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have
each unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of their

withdrawn pursuant to the Offer or any subsequent offering period contemplated
by _Section 2.1(f)_ hereof shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash or
immediately available funds, subject to reduction for any Taxes withheld

promulgated under the Exchange Act.

(g)  _Schedule TO; Offer Documents_. As soon as practicable on the date the

reference an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ "), and forms of the
related letter of transmittal, a summary advertisement, if any, in respect of

Offer will be made or which are required to be filed in connection with the
filing of the Schedule TO (collectively, together with any supplements or
amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "); and (ii) cause the Offer
Documents to be disseminated to the Company Shareholders as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and
Merger Sub in writing all information concerning the Company that may be

Merger Sub for inclusion in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents. Parent
and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule TO and
the Offer Documents to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act
and all other applicable Laws. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
TO or the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect. Parent and Merger Sub
shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO and the Offer
Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the other Offer
Documents, as so corrected, to be disseminated to the Company Shareholders, in
each case as and to the extent required by applicable Laws. Parent and Merger
Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents and any
amendments thereto, in any case prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any comments made by the Company or its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide to the Company and its counsel any and all written comments (and
summaries of all oral comments) that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO and the
Offer Documents promptly after receipt thereof, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to provide
comments with respect to any response to any such comments of the SEC or its
staff (which comments shall be given reasonable and good faith consideration)
and an opportunity to participate in any discussions with the SEC or its staff
concerning such comments to the extent reasonable and appropriate.

Section 2.2 _Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) The Company grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up
Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and conditions set forth in this
_Section 2.2_, to purchase from the Company up to the number of newly-issued
shares of Company Common Stock equal to the lesser of (i) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock owned by Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option,
constitutes one share more than 90% of the sum of (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of all shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option plus (y) all shares of
Company Common Stock which the Company may be required to issue as of such
date upon the vesting (including vesting 



 

18  solely as a result of the consummation of the Offer), conversion or exercise
of all Company Options, the Company Warrant and other derivative securities,
including warrants, options, convertible or exchangeable securities or other
rights to acquire Company Common Stock, regardless of the conversion or
exercise price or other terms and conditions thereof, or (ii) the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock that the Company is authorized to
issue under the Company Articles of Incorporation but that are not issued and
outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise committed to be issued or
reserved for issuance) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option. 

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Parent or Merger Sub only once at
any time following the Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to occur of
(x) the Effective Time and (y) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.2_ hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall
not be exercisable unless, immediately after such exercise and the issuance
of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant thereto, the Short-Form Threshold
shall be reached. The aggregate purchase price payable for the shares of
Company Common Stock being purchased by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to the
Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the number of such shares by
the Offer Price. Such purchase price may be paid by Parent or Merger Sub, at
its election, either entirely in cash or by Parent and Merger Sub, jointly
and severally, executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note
having a principal amount equal to the balance of such purchase price, or any
combination of the foregoing. Any such promissory note shall be on terms as
provided by Parent and Merger Sub, which terms shall include the following:
(i) the principal amount and accrued interest under the promissory note shall
be payable upon the demand of the Company, (ii) the unpaid principal amount of
the promissory note will accrue simple interest at the per annum rate of
three percent (3.0%), (iii) the promissory note may be prepaid in whole or in
part at any time and from time to time, without premium or penalty or prior
notice and (iv) the unpaid principal amount and accrued interest under the
promissory note shall immediately become due and payable in the event that (x)
Parent or Merger Sub fails to make any payment of interest on the promissory
note as provided therein and such failure continues for a period of thirty
(30) days or (y) Parent or Merger Sub files or has filed against it any
petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or makes a general assignment
for the benefit of creditors.

 

(c) In the event Parent or Merger Sub exercises the Top-Up Option, Parent or
Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company a notice setting forth (i) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that Merger Sub intends to purchase pursuant
to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which Parent or Merger Sub intends to
pay the applicable exercise price and (iii) the place and time at which the
closing of the purchase of such shares of Company Common Stock by Merger Sub
is to take place. At the closing of the purchase of such shares of Company
Common Stock, Parent or Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company
the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for such shares, and
the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing
such shares (or, if the Company does not then issue shares of Company Common
Stock in certificated form, the applicable number of shares of Company Common
Stock in non-certificated book-entry form).

Business Days in advance of such time), the Company shall (i) file with the
SEC and any other applicable Governmental Entity a Solicitation/Recommendation

20  including the Company Board Recommendation. Each of Parent and Merger Sub

reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information

information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect. The
Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and any other applicable
Governmental Entity and disseminated to the Company Shareholders, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable securities Laws. The Company
shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel reasonable opportunity to

to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 14D-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, in any case prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company
shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by
Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel. The Company shall provide to Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel any and all written comments (and summaries of
all oral comments) the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly upon receipt thereof, and
the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to any
such comments of the SEC or its staff and an opportunity to participate in
any discussions with the SEC or its staff concerning such comments to the
extent reasonable and appropriate. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject
to compliance with the terms of _Section 7.5_, in connection with any
disclosure regarding a Company Adverse Recommendation Change relating to a
Superior Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall not be
required to provide Parent or Merger Sub the opportunity to review or comment

or Merger Sub to participate in any discussions with the SEC regarding the
Schedule 14D-9, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any comments
thereon, solely with respect to such disclosure.

(c) _Company Information_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall,
or shall cause its transfer agent to, promptly following a request by Parent,
furnish Parent, at Parents cost and expense, with such information as Parent
or its Representatives may reasonably request in order to disseminate and
otherwise communicate the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of
Company Common Stock, including a list, as of the most recent practicable
date, of the Company Shareholders, mailing labels and any available listing or
computer files containing the names and addresses of all record and
beneficial holders of Company Common Stock, and lists of security positions of
Company Common Stock held in stock depositories (including updated lists of
shareholders, mailing labels, listings or files of securities positions).
Subject to any and all applicable Laws, and except for such steps as are
necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary
to consummate the Offer and the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub shall (and
shall cause their respective Representatives to):



 

21 (i) hold in confidence the information contained in any such lists
of shareholders, mailing labels and listings or files of securities positions
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement;

 

(ii) use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger;
and

 

(iii) if (A) this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1 _or
_Section 9.2_ hereof and/or (B) the Offer shall terminate without any shares
of Company Common Stock having been accepted, deliver (and shall use their
respective reasonable efforts to cause their Representatives to deliver) to
the Company any and all copies and any extracts or summaries from such
information then in their possession or under their control.

Section 2.4 _Company Board and Company Board Committees_.

(a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_. Effective upon the
initial acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of shares of Company Common Stock
tendered pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ ," the use of which
term herein shall not, unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon
whether Parent shall exercise its rights under this _Section 2.4(a)_) and
from time to time thereafter up to the Effective Time, subject to payment for
such shares of Company Common Stock and subject to  _Section 2.4(b)_, Parent
shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors on the Company
Board equal to the product (rounded up to the next whole number) obtained by
multiplying (i) the number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect
to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this _Section 2.4(a)_)
and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of Company
Common Stock held by Parent and Merger Sub (giving effect to the shares of
Company Common Stock purchased pursuant to the Offer and, if the Top-Up Option
is exercised, the shares of Company Common Stock purchased upon the exercise
of the Top-Up Option), and the denominator of which is the total number of
then outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Promptly following a request
by Parent, the Company shall cause the individuals so designated by Parent to
be elected or appointed to the Company Board, including either by increasing
the size of the Company Board or by seeking and accepting or otherwise
securing the resignations of such number of then incumbent directors as is
necessary to enable the individuals so designated by Parent to be elected or
appointed to the Company Board (the date on which the majority of the
Companys directors are designees of Parent that have been effectively elected
or appointed to the Company Board in accordance herewith, the " _Board
Appointment Date_ "). From time to time after the Acceptance Time, subject to
payment for such shares of Company Common Stock and subject to _Section
2.4(b)_, the Company shall take all action necessary to cause the individuals
so designated by Parent to constitute substantially the same percentage
(rounding up where appropriate) as is on the Company Board on each committee
of the Company Board to the fullest extent permitted by all applicable Laws,
including the rules of the Nasdaq. Solely for the purposes of this  _Section
2.4_, any and all members of the Company Board immediately prior to such
appointments by Parent who remain on the Company Board after such appointment
by Parent shall be referred to as " _Continuing_  



 

22   _Directors_." Except with respect to two (2) Continuing Directors, the
Company has obtained irrevocable resignations of each director on the Company
Board, which resignations are each contingent solely upon the occurrence of
the Acceptance Time, payment (which, for purposes of this Agreement, shall be
satisfied by receipt by the depositary for the Offer of funds from Parent or
Merger Sub) for all of the shares of Company Common Stock tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and the Companys acceptance of such
resignation. The Company has made available to Parent complete and correct
copies of such resignations. Upon the consummation of the Offer, the Company
shall accept such number of resignations as will be necessary to effectuate
the exercise of Parents rights under this _Section 2.4(a)_, subject to
_Section 2.4(b)_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall have
at least two (2) Continuing Directors. If the number of directors who are
Continuing Directors is reduced below two (2) prior to the Effective Time, the
remaining Continuing Director shall be entitled to designate an individual to
fill such vacancy who is not a current or former officer, director, employee
or consultant of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Parent Insider_ ")
and who shall be deemed a Continuing Director for all purposes of
this Agreement, and the Company shall cause such designee to be appointed to
the Company Board. If, notwithstanding compliance with the foregoing
provisions, the number of Continuing Directors is reduced to zero (0), then
the other directors on the Company Board shall designate and appoint to the
Company Board two (2) directors who are not Parent Insiders who shall be
deemed Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(b) _Continued Listing_. In the event that Parents designees are elected or
appointed to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_, and without
limiting _Section 2.4(a)_, until the Effective Time, the Company Board shall
have at least such number of directors as may be required by the rules of the
Nasdaq or the federal securities Laws who are considered independent
directors within the meaning of such Laws (" _Independent Directors_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that after the Acceptance Time, subject to payment by
Merger Sub for shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer,
the Company shall, upon Parents request, take all action necessary to elect
to be treated as a " _Controlled Company_ " for purposes of Listing Rule
5615(c) of the Nasdaq rules (or any successor provision) and make all
necessary filings and disclosures associated with such status; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in the event the number of Independent Directors shall be
reduced below the number of directors as may be required by such Laws for any
reason whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to
designate persons to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be Independent
Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no other Independent Director
then remains, the other directors shall designate such number of directors as
may be required by the rules of the Nasdaq or the federal securities Laws, to
fill such vacancies who shall not be shareholders or Affiliates of Parent or
Merger Sub, and such Persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for
purposes of this Agreement.

(c)  _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligation to
appoint Parents designees to the Company Board pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_
hereof shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all action required
pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ and Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to 



 

23  fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.4_, and shall include in the
Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its directors
and officers as is required under such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order
to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.4_. Parent shall, reasonably
promptly after the date hereof, provide to the Company in writing, and be
responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees,
directors, officers and Affiliates, required by such Section 14(f) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The provisions of this
_Section 2.4_ are in addition to, and shall not limit, any right that Merger
Sub, Parent or any Affiliate of Merger Sub or Parent may have (with respect to
the election of directors or otherwise) under applicable Laws as a holder or
beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock. 

(d) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in the event that Parents
designees are elected or appointed to the Company Board prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_ hereof, the prior approval of a majority of
the Continuing Directors (or the approval of the sole Continuing Director if
there shall only be one (1) Continuing Director then in office) shall be
required in order to, prior to the Effective Time, (i) amend, modify or
terminate this Agreement, or agree or consent to any amendment, modification
or termination of this Agreement, in any case on behalf of the Company, (ii)
extend the time for performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or other
acts of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement, (iii) waive any of the
Companys rights under this Agreement, (iv) amend or otherwise modify in any
material respect the Company Articles of Incorporation or Company Bylaws, (v)
authorize or execute any material Contract, or any material amendment or
material modification of any Contract, between the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates
on the other hand, or the termination of any such material Contract then in
effect by the Company or any such Company Subsidiary or (vi) make any other
determination or give any approval or authorization that is required to be
taken or given by the Company Board with respect to any action to be taken or
not to be taken by or on behalf of the Company relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger.
Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to
_Section 2.4(a)_ and prior to the Effective Time, any actions with respect
to the enforcement of this Agreement by the Company shall be effected only by
and at the direction of a majority of the Continuing Directors (or the action
of the sole Continuing Director if there shall only be one (1) Continuing
Director then in office), and any such authorization or direction shall
constitute the authorization and direction of the full Company Board with
respect thereto, and no other action on the part of the Company, including
any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to
authorize, or for the Company to take, any such action.

reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock occurring or with a record date on or after

the Merger Consideration shall provide to the holders of Company Common Stock
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
action; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 4.1(d)_ shall be construed
to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 4.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with
this _Article IV_ , cash in U.S. dollars in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration payable in connection with the
Merger (such cash, the " _Exchange Fund_ ") pursuant to _Section 4.1_ in
exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. The Paying Agent
shall, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to, deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to _Section 4.1 _out of the
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i) no such investment or
losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
Company Common Stock; and (ii) such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable pursuant to _Section
4.1 _shall be promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, in
each case as directed by Parent. In the event that the Exchange Fund shall be
insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in connection
with the Merger, Parent shall promptly deposit or cause to be deposited
additional funds in the amount of such insufficiency. The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose.

 



 

27 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no
event later than three (3) Business Days following the Effective Time), Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate
or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
," it being understood that any references herein to " _Certificates_ " shall
be deemed to include references to book-entry account statements relating to
the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) and whose shares of Company
Common Stock have been converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1_ (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall include customary
provisions with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock held in book-entry form) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and
duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably
required pursuant to such instructions (or, if such shares are held in book-
entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a book-entry
transfer agent of the surrender of such shares on a book-entry account
statement), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration
payable to holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to
the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have
been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 4.2_, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration or the
right to demand to be paid an amount for the shares represented thereby in
accordance with the provisions of Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA as contemplated
by _Section 4.3_.

 

(c) _Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and
any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with
this _Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon.



 

28 (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any cash
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Paying Agent will, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to, issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

(g) _No Further Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions with respect
to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates.

 

Section 4.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and are held by a
shareholder (each, a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ") who is entitled to
exercise, and properly exercises, dissenters rights with respect to such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into or exchangeable for or represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (except as provided in this _Section 4.3_)
and shall entitle such Dissenting Shareholder only to payment for such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA, unless and
until such Dissenting Shareholder withdraws (in accordance with the WBCA) or
effectively loses the right to dissent. If any Dissenting Shareholder shall
have effectively withdrawn (in accordance with the WBCA) or lost the right to
dissent, then as of the later of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such
event, the Dissenting Shares held by such Dissenting Shareholder shall be
cancelled and converted into and represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1_. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make (or cause or permit to
be made on its behalf) any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, or otherwise negotiate with, any Dissenting Shareholder regarding its
exercise of dissenters rights prior to the Effective Time. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any such demands prior to the Effective Time, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in and control all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to any exercise by any Company Shareholder of
dissenters rights. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, if no
vote of the holders of any class or series of the Companys Equity
Interests is necessary to approve this Agreement or the merger contemplated
hereby in accordance with Section 23B.11.040 of the WBCA, the Parties hereby
agree that any Company Shareholder that is entitled to dissenters rights
under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA may assert dissenters rights in accordance
with the provisions of Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA. For the avoidance of doubt,
it is acknowledged and agreed that, for all purposes under Chapter 23B.13 of
the WBCA and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the fair
value of the Dissenting Shares shall be determined without regard to the Top-
Up Option, the shares of Company Common Stock issued

 



 

29  pursuant to the Top-Up Option or any promissory note delivered by Parent or
Merger Sub to the Company in payment for the shares of Company Common Stock
issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option. 

Section 4.4 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed (after giving effect to the items
contemplated by this _Article IV_ ) and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time on the records of the Company. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock except to
receive the Merger Consideration therefor and as otherwise provided herein or
by Law.

Section 4.5 _Company Options, Company Restricted Stock, Company Warrant and
Company Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Waivers_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents or
releases, if any, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
from holders of Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units and take
all such other action, without incurring any liabilities in
connection therewith, as Parent may deem to be necessary or reasonably
required to give effect to the transactions contemplated by _Section 4.5(b)_
or _(c)_. As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the
Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions
as are required to give effect to the transactions contemplated by _Section
4.5(b)_ and _(c)_. 

(b) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Option, whether
vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each former holder of any such
cancelled Company Option as soon as practicable following the Effective Time a
cash amount equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the per share
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option,
and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Company
Option, subject to withholding of applicable income and employment
withholding Taxes; _provided_ that if the exercise price per share of any such
Company Option is equal to or greater than the per share Merger Consideration,
such Company Option shall be canceled or expire without any cash payment
being made in respect thereof. Promptly following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall deliver written notice to each holder of a Company Option
informing such holder of the effect of the Merger on the Company Options.

(c) _Company Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each Company
Restricted Stock Unit, whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled, with
the holder of such Company Restricted Stock Unit becoming entitled to receive,
in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, an
amount in cash equal to the per share Merger Consideration multiplied by the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Restricted
Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to withholding of
applicable income, employment or other Taxes. 



 

30 (d) _Company Warrant_. Within three (3) Business Day of the date hereof, the
Company shall deliver to the holders of the Company Warrant the notice
required by the Company Warrant, which notice shall indicate that the Company
Warrant shall not be assumed by Parent and the cash redemption amount with
respect to the Company Warrant.

(e) _Company Stock Plans_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall
terminate all Company Stock Plans, effective not later than the Effective
Time.

Section 4.6 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold or cause to be deducted
and withheld from any consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or non-United States Tax Law, with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted or withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made.

ARTICLE V

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except (i) as expressly disclosed in the Company SEC Filings filed or
furnished by the Company with the SEC (other than any disclosures contained
or referenced therein under the headings "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking
Statements" and any other information, factors or risks that are predictive,
cautionary or forward-looking in nature that are contained or referenced
therein), in each case on or after December 31, 2009 and prior to the date
hereof (excluding any exhibits filed pursuant to section 3 or section 10 of
the Exhibit Table contained in Item 601 of Regulation S-K) (the " _Recent SEC
Reports_ ") (it being understood that any information disclosed in any Recent
SEC Report shall qualify a specific representation and warranty contained in
this Article V only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such
information would be expected to qualify such representation or warranty, and
provided that the representations and warranties set forth in _Sections
5.2(a)_ , _5.2(b)_ and _5.2(c)_ shall not be qualified by any information
disclosed in the Recent SEC Reports) or (ii) as set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub as follows:

 

Section 5.1 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a corporation
duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of the State of
Washington. Each Subsidiary of the Company (each, a " _Company Subsidiary_ ")
is duly organized, is validly existing and, where such concept is recognized,
in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, as the case may be, except to the extent the failure of any such
Company Subsidiary to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. _Section 5.1_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete list of all of the
Company Subsidiaries, the ownership interest of the Company in each Company
Subsidiary, and the ownership interest of any other Person or

 



 

31  Persons in each Company Subsidiary. Each of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary has the requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted, except where the failure to have such power or authority,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed
to do business and, where such concept is recognized, is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or
operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for such failures
to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has
delivered to Parent complete and correct copies of the articles of
incorporation and bylaws (or similar organizational documents) of the Company
and each Company Subsidiary, each as amended to date, and each as so delivered
is in full force and effect.

 

Section 5.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 150,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock, 30,000,000 shares of non-voting common stock,
without par value (" _Company Non-Voting Common Stock_ ") and 30,000,000
shares of preferred stock, without par value (" _Company Preferred Stock_ ").
As of August 31, 2010, there were (i) 86,584,072 shares of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding, (ii) no shares of Company Common Stock held in
the treasury of the Company, (iii) 11,447,400 shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of outstanding Company Options, (iv) 1,500,000 shares

Subsidiary, (vii) no shares of Company Non-Voting Common Stock issued and
outstanding and (viii) no shares of Company Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable. All shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise or
settlement of Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units have been
duly reserved for issuance by the Company, and upon any issuance of such
shares in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan, will
be duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable.

 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_ and for the Top-Up Option, there
are no options, warrants or other rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any character to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
a party or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound relating to
the issued or unissued Equity Interests of the Company or obligating the
Company to issue or sell any Equity Interests in the Company. _Section
5.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and correct
list of (i) the exercise prices and vesting schedules for outstanding Company
Options and (ii) vesting schedules for outstanding Company Restricted Stock
Units.



 

32 (c) Except as set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_ and for the Top-Up Option, there
are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary affecting the voting rights of, or requiring the repurchase,
redemption, issuance, creation or disposition of, any Equity Interests in the
Company. Except as set forth in _Section 5.2(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, since August 31, 2010 through the date hereof, the Company has not
issued any Equity Interests in the Company, except for issuances pursuant to
exercise or settlement of Company Options and Company Restricted Stock Units,
in each case outstanding as of the close of business on August 31, 2010, and
only in accordance with the terms of such Company Options and Company
Restricted Stock Units as in effect on such date. There are no outstanding
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company having the right
to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right
to vote) on any matter on which the Company Shareholders may vote.

(d) Each outstanding share of capital stock or other Equity Interest of each
Company Subsidiary is (to the extent such concept is applicable) duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights and is held, directly or indirectly, by the Company or another Company
Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens. Except as set forth in _Section
5.2(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no subscriptions,
options, warrants, rights, calls, contracts or other commitments,
understandings, restrictions or arrangements relating to the issuance,
acquisition, redemption, repurchase or sale of any Equity Interest or other
ownership interests of any Company Subsidiary, including any right of
conversion or exchange under any outstanding security, instrument or
agreement.

 

(e) _Section 5.2(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the name,
jurisdiction of organization and the Companys (or the Company Subsidiarys)
percentage ownership of any and all Persons in which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary owns, or has the right or obligation to acquire any Equity
Interest (other than any Company Subsidiary) (collectively, the "
_Investments_ "). All of the Investments are owned by the Company or by a
Company Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted
Encumbrances. Except for the capital stock and other ownership interests of
the Company Subsidiaries and the Investments, the Company does not own,
directly or indirectly, any Equity Interest in any Person that is material to
the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(f) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has entered into
any Contract requiring it to contribute capital, loan money or otherwise
provide funds or make additional investments in any other Person, other than
any such Contract entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice with respect to wholly owned Subsidiaries of the Company.
Other than the Shareholders Agreement and Investors Rights Agreement, there
are no shareholder agreements, voting trusts, proxies or other Contracts to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which it is
bound relating to the voting or registration of any Equity Interests of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or preemptive rights with respect thereto.
The Company has entered into an irrevocable agreement with the requisite
number of Company Shareholders to terminate the Shareholders Agreement and
the Investors



 

33  Rights Agreement, which termination is conditioned solely upon the closing
of the Offer, including payment (which shall be satisfied by receipt by the
depositary for the Offer of funds from Parent or Merger Sub) for all of the
shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer, and the Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct
copy of such agreement to terminate the Shareholders Agreement and the
Investors Rights Agreement.

Section 5.3 _Corporate Authority and Approval_.

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to obtaining any necessary Company Shareholder
Approval, to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company and no shareholder votes are necessary to authorize this Agreement
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby other than, with
respect to the Merger, the filing of appropriate merger documents as required
by the WBCA and any necessary Company Shareholder Approval. This Agreement has
been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming this Agreement
is a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the
Enforceability Exception.

(b) In the event of a Long-Form Merger, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in _Section
6.9_, the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding on the record date of the Company Shareholders
Meeting, voting together as a single group (the " _Company Shareholder
Approval_ "), is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the
Companys Equity Interests necessary to approve this Agreement. In the event
of a Short-Form Merger, if the holdings of Company Common Stock by Merger Sub
meet the ownership threshold required by Section 23B.11.040 of the WBCA, and
Merger Sub otherwise complies with the requirements of Section 23B.11.040 of
the WBCA, no vote of the holders of any class or series of the Companys
Equity Interests is necessary to approve this Agreement in accordance with
Section 23B.11.040 of the WBCA.

 

(c) On or prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company Board has received
from Goldman, Sachs and Co. (the " _Company Financial Advisor_ ") its opinion,
subject to the limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein,
that the $9.75 in cash per share to be paid to the holders of Company Common
Stock (other than Parent and Merger Sub) pursuant to this Agreement is fair,
from a financial point of view, to such holders, and, as of the date of this
Agreement, such opinion has not been withdrawn, revoked or modified. The
Company will furnish a complete and correct copy of such opinion to Parent
promptly after receipt thereof by the Company for informational purposes only;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor Merger Sub may rely upon such
opinion.

 



 

34 (d) The Company has been advised by each of its directors and
executive officers who are holders of shares of Company Common Stock that, as
of the date hereof, such directors and executive officers intend to tender
their shares of Company Common Stock to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer.

 

Section 5.4 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 

(a) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not, and
the performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby will not, (i) assuming the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained or
not required, conflict with or violate any provision of the Company Articles
of Incorporation or the Company Bylaws or any equivalent organizational
documents of any Company Subsidiary, (ii) assuming that all consents,
approvals and authorizations described in _Section 5.4(b)_ will have been

Company Subsidiary is bound or affected or (iii) require any consent or
approval under, result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or
constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under, or give to others any right of termination,
vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a Lien (other than a Permitted Encumbrance) on any property or
asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to, any Contract to
which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which any of
their respective properties or assets are bound, except, with respect to
clauses (ii) and (iii), for matters that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby will not, require any consent, approval or authorization of, or filing
with or notification to, any Governmental Entity or stock exchange, except
(i) for any consent, approval, authorization, filing or notification required
under the Exchange Act, any applicable Blue Sky Laws or the rules and
regulations of the Nasdaq, (ii) for the Required Antitrust Approvals, (iii)
for the filing of the Articles of Merger, the Plan of Merger and any other
filings as required by the WBCA in connection with the consummation of the
Merger, or (iv) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals
or authorizations, or to make such filings or notifications, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Articles of Incorporation
and the Company Bylaws, establish a record date for, call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the Company Shareholders (the " _Company

consent of the Parties, the notice for such Company Shareholders Meeting may
be given prior to the Acceptance Time or prior to the expiration of any such
subsequent offering period. The Company shall solicit from the Company
Shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Plan

contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Companys obligation to establish a

proviso in the first sentence of this _Section 7.2_, it shall be subject to
the prior occurrence of the Acceptance Time.

(b) In connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting, if any, the Company

Company, Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, shall furnish all
information concerning the Company or Parent and Merger Sub as the other Party
or Parties hereto, as the case may be, may reasonably request in connection
with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement. Subject
to all applicable Laws, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Proxy Statement to be disseminated to the Company Shareholders as
promptly as practicable following the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company
shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Proxy Statement and all other materials used in
connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting that (i) constitute "proxy
materials" or "solicitation materials" as those terms are used in Rules 14a-1
through 14a-17 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) are otherwise used
for the "solicitation" of "proxies" as those terms are defined in Rule 14a-1
promulgated under the Exchange Act, in each case prior to the filing thereof
with the SEC or the



 

64  dissemination thereof to Company Shareholders. The Company shall advise
Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC
or its staff for an amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, or
comments thereon and responses thereto, or requests by the SEC or its staff
for additional information in connection therewith. If at any time prior to
the Company Shareholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company or
Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective directors, officers or
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent or Merger Sub which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other Party or Parties, as the case may be, and an appropriate amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement describing such information shall be
promptly prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the Company Shareholders. The Company shall
cause the Proxy Statement to comply as to form and substance in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Nasdaq. 

(c) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article IX_
hereof, subject to the terms of  _Section 7.5(d)_ hereof, the Company shall

with respect to the Offer).

 

(d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall vote all shares of Company Common
Stock acquired in the Offer (or otherwise beneficially owned by them or any
of their respective Subsidiaries as of the applicable record date) in favor of
the approval of this Agreement in accordance with the WBCA at the Company
Shareholders Meeting or otherwise.

 

(e) The Company shall provide Parent with reasonable advance notice of any
meeting of the Company Shareholders (or any solicitation of written consent
in lieu of a meeting) occurring prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article IX_ hereof, and shall permit Representatives of Parent
and Merger Sub to attend any such meeting or review any such consent.

Section 7.3 _Short-Form Merger_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section
7.2_ hereof, in the event that Parent and Merger Sub shall acquire at least
ninety percent (90%) of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer or otherwise (including as a result of the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or pursuant to any subsequent offering period)
(the " _Short-Form Threshold_ "), subject to _Section 8.1(c)_, Parent shall
have the option (the " _Short-Form Election_ ") to require the Parties to take
all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Short-Form Merger of the
Company into Merger Sub to become effective, in accordance with Section
23B.11.040 of the WBCA, as promptly as reasonably practicable after such
acquisition, without a meeting of the Company Shareholders.

information or (B) provide access to or furnish any information if doing so
would violate any applicable Law or Contract ( _provided_ that the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to seek the consent of the counterparty
to such Contract to provide access to or furnish any such information to
Parent and Merger Sub), or where such access to information would involve the
waiver or loss of an attorney-client or work product privilege so long as the
Company has reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit such inspection of or
to disclose such information on a basis that does not compromise or waive such
privilege with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access and
information shall be disclosed or granted, as applicable, subject to

information or data concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any
Person pursuant to any commercial arrangement, joint venture arrangement or
other existing agreement or arrangement with the intention to facilitate an
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not prohibit the
Company or any Company Subsidiary from providing information or data to a
Third Party as and to the extent required by, and in accordance with, ordinary
course of business written Contracts as in effect on the date hereof between
the Company and such Third Party, provided that any restrictions on use,

effect that the Company is ending all discussions and negotiations with
such Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, effective on the date
hereof, and, except for (and subject to the terms of _Section 7.1(a)_)
Persons with respect to whom the Company is having discussions regarding a
licensing, collaboration, sale or similar arrangement with respect to IL-21
(in which case any restrictions on use, confidentiality and similar provisions
contained in any Contracts between the Company or any Company Subsidiary, on
the one hand, and such Persons, on the other hand, shall be enforced), the
notice shall also request such Person to promptly return or destroy all
confidential information

 



 

67  concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; _provided_ that the

to providing such information, the Company has received from the Person so
requesting such information an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement,

provided to any Person making such Acquisition Proposal that is given such

with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Laws, and (B) the

_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) if the Company has received a _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal did not arise
out of any breach of this  _Section 7.5_ except any Immaterial Breach) from
any Person that has not been withdrawn and that the Company Board concludes in
good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, (x) the Company Board may effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal,
or (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, if and only if:

 

(A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Laws;

(B) the Company shall have complied with all of its obligations under this
_Section 7.5_ with respect to such Superior Proposal except any Immaterial
Breaches;

 

(C) the Company shall have provided prior written notice (a " _Determination
Notice_ ") to Parent at least three (3) Business Days in advance (the "
_Notice Period_ "), to the effect that the Company Board has received a _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal did not arise
out of any breach of this  _Section 7.5 _



 

69  except any Immaterial Breach) that the Company Board has concluded in good
faith constitutes a Superior Proposal and, absent any revision to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board has determined to effect
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 7.5(d)_, which notice shall specify the identity of
the Person or group of Persons making the Superior Proposal, the material
terms thereof and copies of all relevant documents relating to such Superior
Proposal;

 

(D) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
termination, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal
advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and the Parent
Representatives in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement, so
that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ that, in the event of any material revisions to the Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new Determination Notice to Parent and
to comply with the requirements of this _Section 7.5 _(including _Section
7.5(d)_) with respect to such new Determination Notice and the revised
Superior Proposal contemplated thereby; and

(E) in the case of any action contemplated by clause (y) of this  _Section
7.5(d)_, the Company shall have terminated this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 9.1(c)(ii)_, including the payment of the Company Termination Fee in
accordance with _Section 9.4(b)(i)_; or

 

(ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board
may take the actions specified in clauses (A), (C)(2) or (E) of _Section
7.5(c)(i)_ ( _"Intervening Event Change of Recommendation_ ") in response to
an Intervening Event if the Company Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws, if and only if:

 

(A) the Company shall have provided a Determination Notice to Parent for at
least the Notice Period to the effect that the Company Board has determined
to effect an Intervening Event Change of Recommendation, which notice shall
specify the Intervening Event in reasonable detail (and _provided_ that any
material change to the facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening
Event Change of Recommendation shall require a new notice and a new Notice
Period);

(B) prior to effecting such Intervening Event Change of Recommendation, the
Company shall, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement in



 

70  such a manner that such Intervening Event no longer necessitates such
Intervening Event Change of Recommendation; and

 

(C) at or following the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that such Intervening Event continues to necessitate an Intervening Event
Change of Recommendation (in each case taking into account any revisions to
this Agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent).

 

None of the Company, the Company Board or any committee of the Company Board
shall enter into any agreement with any Person providing that the Company is
not permitted to give prior notice to Parent of its intention to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation or prior notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement in
light of a Superior Proposal, or limiting its ability to give such notice, in
each case in accordance with this _Section 7.5(d)_.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.5 _shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from (i) complying with
its disclosure obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to shareholders), _provided_ , that
any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board
Recommendation within five (5) Business Days following any request by Parent,
or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act.

 

(f) The Company agrees that it shall promptly (and, in any event, within one
(1) Business Day of the Companys Knowledge of any such event) notify Parent
if (x) any proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are
received by, (y) in connection with any inquiry, proposal or offer that could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, any non-public
information is requested from or (z) any discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated or continued in connection with the submission of an
Acquisition Proposal with, the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company
Representative indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the
Person or group of Persons making such offer or proposal and the material
terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable,
copies of any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed
agreements) and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt
basis, of any material developments or modifications to the terms of any such
proposals or offers and the status of any such material discussions or
negotiations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
shall provide to Parent, as soon as practicable and in any event within one
(1) Business Day after receipt or delivery thereof, copies of all draft
agreements (and any other written material to the extent such material
contains any

  

 

71  financial terms, conditions or other material terms relating to any
Acquisition Proposal) sent by or provided to the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any Company Representative in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal.

(g) No Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Intervening Event Change
of Recommendation shall change the approval of the Company Board for purposes
of causing any Takeover Provision to be inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Support Agreements.

 

(h) The Company agrees that in any event any Company Subsidiary or Company
Representative takes any action which, if taken by the Company, would
constitute a breach of this _Section 7.5_, the Company shall be deemed to be
in breach of this _Section 7.5_.

 

Section 7.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including _Section
7.5_, Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other and use (and

to the contrary contained in this Agreement and subject to _Section 7.6(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parties hereby agree and acknowledge
that neither this _Section 7.6 _nor the "reasonable best efforts" standard
shall require, or be construed to require Parent or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, in order to obtain any
required approval from any Governmental Entity or any Third Party, to: (i) (A)
sell, lease, license, 



 

72  transfer, dispose of, divest or otherwise encumber, or hold separate pending
any such action, or (B) propose, negotiate or offer to effect, or consent or
commit to, any such sale, leasing, licensing, transfer, disposal, divestiture
or other encumberment, or holding separate, before or after the Acceptance
Time or the Effective Time, of any material assets, licenses, operations,
rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein of Parent, the Company
or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates), or (ii) take or agree to take any other material action or agree
or consent to any material limitations or restrictions on freedom of actions

Surviving Corporation (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates).

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with each other in (i) determining whether any filings are required
to be made with, or consents, Permits, authorizations, advance ruling
certificates, no-action letters, waivers or approvals are required or
advisable to be obtained from, any Third Parties or Governmental Entities
under any other applicable Laws in connection with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, and (ii) timely making all such
required filings and timely seeking all such required consents, Permits,
authorizations, advance ruling certificates, no-action letters or approvals.

 

(c) Subject to _Section 2.3(c)_, _Section 7.4 _and applicable Law, each of
Parent and the Company shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other
with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and equityholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or
application required to be made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries to any Third Party or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, Parent shall have the right to direct all matters
with any Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder; 
_provided_ that Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other on and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives, that appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of Parent and the
Company shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

 

(d) Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the obtaining of any consents, approvals,

this _Section 7.6_, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by



 

73  Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Representative, or the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or Company Representative, as the case may be, from any
Third Party or any Governmental Entity with respect to its right to approve
or otherwise consent to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor Parent shall permit
any of its Representatives to participate in any meeting with
any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other
inquiry unless, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, it
consults with the other Party in advance and gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in  _Section 7.6(a) _through _Section 7.6(d)_, if any objections
are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
Law or if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the
United States Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of
Justice or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any
Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each Party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to contest, resist and resolve any such objections
or Actions, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 7.7 _Actions with Respect to Facility Agreement_. At the Acceptance
Time, the Company shall pay to the lenders under the Facility Agreement the

Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other orally and in writing of
(a) to such Partys Knowledge, the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause
(i) the occurrence or existence of any of the conditions to the Offer set
forth in _Annex A_ or (ii) any condition to the obligations of any Party to
effect the Merger set forth in _Article VIII_ not to be satisfied, (b) any
Action commenced or, to any Partys Knowledge, threatened against, such Party

Party or any of its Affiliates, in each case in connection with, arising from

contemplated hereby (the " _Transaction Litigation_ "), or (c) to such Partys
Knowledge, the failure of any such Party to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement which, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any
Party to effect the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
hereby not to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 7.8_ shall not

  

 

74  cure any breach of any representation or warranty or otherwise limit or
affect the remedies available hereunder to any Party.

 

Section 7.9 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company and Parent shall give each
other the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement and/or
prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; _provided_ that neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary or Company Representative shall compromise, settle,
come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation or consent to the same unless
Parent shall first have consented thereto in writing (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ ,  _further_ ,
that after the Acceptance Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent with
respect to, and, if requested by Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to
settle, any unresolved Transaction Litigation in accordance with
Parents direction.

Section 7.10 _Publicity_.

 

(a) The initial press release regarding the execution of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release by the
Company and Parent in a mutually agreed upon form and thereafter the Company
and Parent each shall consult with the other prior to issuing any press
releases or otherwise making public announcements (including conference calls
with investors and analysts) with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement. No Party shall issue any
such press release or make any such public announcements prior to such
consultation, except to the extent the disclosing Party determines, based on
advice of counsel, that it is required to do so by applicable Law or any
listing agreement with a securities exchange, in which case such Party shall
use reasonable best efforts to consult with the other Party before issuing or
making any such press release or public announcement.

Section 7.12 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights of indemnification,
exculpation and limitation of liabilities existing in favor of the current or
former directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (the
" _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Company Articles of
Incorporation and the Company Bylaws or under any indemnification, employment
or other similar agreements between any Indemnified



 

75  Party and the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each case as in effect
on the date of this Agreement with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their respective terms. From and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay and perform in a
timely manner such indemnification obligations. Subject to  _Section
7.12(b)_, for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification and
limitation of liabilities of the Indemnified Parties and advancement of
expenses than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Company
Articles of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws.

 

(b) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, or if Parent dissolves the

provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this  _Section
7.12_.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time the Company shall obtain and fully pay the
premium for non-cancellable extension (or "tail") of the directors and
officers liability insurance coverage of the Companys existing directors
and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, " _D andO Insurance
Policies_"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time (such period, the "
_Tail Period_ ") with respect to any claim related to any period or time at
or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with a same or better
credit rating than the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to
DandO Insurance Policies with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are the same as the coverage provided under the Companys
existing policies and covering each Person currently covered by the Companys
existing policies;  _provided_ that prior to obtaining any such "tail"
insurance policies, the Company shall consult in good faith with Parent with
respect thereto; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not
obtain any such "tail" insurance policies without the prior consent of Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If
the Company for any reason does not obtain such "tail" insurance policies at
or prior to the Effective Time, then from the Effective Time through the end
of the Tail Period, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain in effect the Companys current DandO Insurance Policies covering each
officer and director currently covered by the Companys DandO Insurance
Policies for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time with
respect to any matter claimed against such officer or director by reason of
him or her serving in such capacity on terms with respect to such coverage
and amounts no less favorable than those of such DandO Insurance Policies in
effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that in no event shall the
aggregate costs of such DandO Insurance Policies exceed in any one (1) year
during the Tail Period 250% of the current aggregate annual premiums paid by
the Company for such purpose (which aggregate annual premiums with respect to
such period are set forth 



 

76  in _Section 5.19_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule), it being understood
that Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall nevertheless be obligated to
provide such coverage, with respect to each year during the Tail Period, as
may be obtained for such 250% annual amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may (i) substitute therefor insurance
policies of any nationally recognized reputable insurance company with a same
or better credit rating than the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance Policies or (ii) satisfy its obligation under this
_Section 7.12(c)_ by causing the Company to obtain and fully pay the premium
for non-cancellable extension (or "tail") directors and officers insurance
policies and fiduciary liability insurance policy for the Tail Period, in each
case, with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no
less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing DandO
Insurance Policies as of the date hereof. Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain any "tail" policies purchased pursuant to
this _Section 7.12(c)_ in full force and effect through such Tail Period.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.12_ shall (i) survive the consummation
of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their respective heirs and
representatives and (iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by Contract or otherwise. From and after the Acceptance Time, the provisions
of this _Section 7.12_ may not be amended in any manner adverse to any
Indemnified Party without his or her consent. 

Section 7.13 _Takeover Provisions_. Parent, the Company and their respective
Boards of Directors shall (a) take all reasonable action necessary to ensure
that no Takeover Provision is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Support Agreements or the transactions provided for herein or therein,
including the Offer and the Merger, and (b) if any Takeover Provision becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Support Agreements or the transactions
contemplated herein or therein, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure
that the transactions provided for in this Agreement and the Support
Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and the Support Agreements and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such Takeover Provision on Parent and Merger Sub, this
Agreement, the Support Agreements and the transactions provided for herein or
therein.

Section 7.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may reasonably be necessary and permitted to
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (a) any
dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted
Stock Units and derivative securities with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock) by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the
Company, and (b) the conversion of Company Options as contemplated by _Section
4.5_ hereof, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 7.15 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Company shall not, from and after the date hereof and
until the Effective Time, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan,
program, agreement or arrangement



 

77  pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or pursuant to which
benefits are provided, in each case to any current or former director,
manager, officer, employee or independent contractor of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary unless, prior to such entry into, establishment, amendment
or modification, the Compensation Committee (each member of which the Company
Board determined is an "independent director" within the meaning of Listing
Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq rules and shall be an "independent director" in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act
at the time of any such action) shall have taken all such steps as may
reasonably be necessary to (a) approve as an Employment Compensation
Arrangement each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and (b) satisfy
the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2)
under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program, agreement or
arrangement; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 7.15_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

Section 7.16 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable
Laws (including the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq) to cause the
delisting of the Company Common Stock from the Nasdaq and the deregistration
of the Company Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time.

 

Section 7.17 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a)

 

(i) During the one (1)-year period commencing at the Effective Time (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), except as may be provided in an individual
employment contract, Parent shall provide or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to Continuing Employees, for so long as they remain
employed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary during the Continuation
Period, compensation and benefits (other than equity-based compensation or
benefits) that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than the compensation
and benefits (other than equity-based compensation and benefits) being
provided to Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time
under the Company Plans.

(ii) Notwithstanding  _Section 7.17(a)(i)_: (A) a Continuing Employee who
remains employed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary after the Effective
Time and who, during the Continuation Period, ceases to be so employed and
who, without any break (other than pre-scheduled vacation and/or Parent-
observed holidays), accepts an offer to become employed by Parent or any of
its Affiliates (other than the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation) (a " _Transferred Employee_ ") shall be provided with
such compensation and benefits as are provided to similarly situated employees
of Parent and its Affiliates (other than the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries) in lieu of the compensation and benefits specified in
_Section 7.17(a)(i)_,



 

78  except that any severance benefits shall be provided in accordance with
_Section 7.17(b)(ii)_; and (B) during and subsequent to the Continuation
Period, Parent reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to transition
Continuing Employees who remain employed by the Company or a Company
Subsidiary after the Effective Time into Parents or an Affiliates benefit
plans, programs, agreements and arrangements (the " _Parent Benefit Plans_
"). In such event, such Continuing Employees (who, along with Transferred
Employees described in _Section 7.17(a)(ii)(A)_ above, are referred to as "
_Transitioned Employees_ ") shall be provided with such benefits as are
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Affiliates (other
than the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries) in lieu of the
benefits specified in _Section 7.17(a)(i)_, except that any severance
benefits shall be provided in accordance with _Section 7.17(b)(ii)_.

(b) 

(i) Parent shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide
the severance benefits set forth on _Section 7.17(b)(i)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule to former employees of the Company listed on such _Section
7.17(b)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule who as of the Effective Time
are entitled to receive such severance benefits.

(ii) During the Continuation Period, Parent shall provide or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to provide Transitioned Employees who experience a
termination of employment with severance benefits in accordance with _Section
7.17(b)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(c) Each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for all service with the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors under
any employee benefit plan of Parent or its Affiliates in which such Continuing
Employee is eligible to participate, including any such plans providing
vacation, sick pay, severance and retirement benefits maintained by Parent or
its Affiliates in which such Continuing Employees participate for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and entitlement to benefits, including for severance
benefits and vacation entitlement (but not for accrual of pension benefits),
to the extent past service was recognized for such Continuing Employees under
the comparable Company Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time, and to
the same extent past service is credited under such plans or arrangements for
similarly situated employees of Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this _Section 7.17(c)_ shall be construed to require crediting of
service that would result in (i) duplication of benefits, (ii) service credit
for benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan or (iii) service
credit under a newly established plan for which prior service is not taken
into account for employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries generally.

 

(d) In the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to Continuing
Employees following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause (i) the waiver of
all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the

in the absence of such change, and (ii) for the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs, the crediting of each Continuing Employee with any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to any such change in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements after such change.

consistent with this  _Section 7.17_, nothing contained herein, whether
express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of
any employee benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or shall limit the right of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any benefit or compensation

DCP has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to
review and approval by Parent) not later than the day immediately preceding
the Acceptance Time.

 

(h) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 7.17_ are included for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto,

any employees or former employees of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
any Affiliate of the Company, any Continuing Employee or Transitioned
Employee, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued
employment or any particular term or condition of employment with Parent or

ceased to exist; provided, however, that the right to terminate this

Party whose breach of any covenant or obligation under this Agreement has been
a proximate cause of (1) the occurrence of any conditions of the Offer set
forth in _Annex A_ hereto or (2) the expiration or termination of the Offer
without Merger Sub having accepted for payment any shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer; 

(c) by the Company if:

 

(i)(A) Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached in any material respect any of
the covenants or agreements made by it in this Agreement, or (B) any of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement shall have been inaccurate when made or shall have become inaccurate
as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement (as if made on such

inaccuracy would prevent Parent and Merger Sub from accepting for payment or
paying for the shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer
or consummating the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;
_provided_ that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)(i)_ if, at the time of such
termination, there exists a material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this Agreement; or

 

(ii)(A) the Company Board has concluded that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B) the Company has complied in all material
respects with _Section 7.5_, and (C) immediately after the termination of

pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ is conditioned on and subject to the
payment by the Company to Parent of the Company Termination Fee in accordance
with _Section 9.4(b)(i)_, and any purported termination pursuant to this
_Section 9.1(c)(ii)_ shall be void and of no force or effect if the Company
shall not pay the Company Termination Fee in accordance with  _Section
9.4(b)(i)_; or

(d) by Parent if:

 

(i)(A) the Company shall have breached any of the covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement to be complied with by the Company (other than
_Section 7.5_) such that the condition set forth in clause (e) on _Annex A_

  

 

82  would have occurred and be continuing or (B) there exists a breach of any
representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement such
that the condition set forth in clause (d) on _Annex A_ would have occurred
and be continuing, and, in the case of either clause (A) or (B), such breach
is incapable of being cured by the End Date or is not cured by the Company
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the Company receives written notice
of such breach from Parent or Merger Sub; _provided_ that Parent shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
9.1(d)(i)_ if, at the time of such termination, there exists a material
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent or
Merger Sub contained in this Agreement; or

 

(ii) prior to the Acceptance Time, (A) the Company Board or any committee
thereof shall have effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or an
Intervening Event Change of Recommendation or (B) the Company shall have

the prior approval of this Agreement by the Company Shareholders in
accordance with the WBCA, this Agreement may be terminated and the Offer and
the Merger may be abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time (it being
agreed that the Party terminating this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section
9.2_ shall give prompt written notice of such termination to the other
Parties), by either Parent or the Company if (a) any Order of any Governmental
Entity having competent jurisdiction is entered permanently enjoining
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub from consummating the Offer or the Merger
and such Order has become final and nonappealable, or (b) if there shall be
any Law that makes the consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal or
otherwise prohibited (unless the consummation of the Offer or the Merger in
violation of such Law would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect) and,
prior to termination pursuant to this _Section 9.2_, the terminating Party
shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations under
_Section 7.6(e)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ shall not be available to any Party

resisted, resolved or lifted, as applicable.

Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_ (other than under _Section 9.1(a)_) or

_Section 9.2_ pursuant to which such termination is effected.

Section 9.4 _Effect of Termination; Termination Fee and Expense
Reimbursement_. 

(a) _Effect of Termination Generally_. Except as otherwise set forth in this
_Section 9.4_, in the event of a termination of this Agreement by either the
Company or Parent as provided in _Section 9.1 _or _Section 9.2_, this
Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and there shall be no liability
or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their
respective directors, managers, officers, equityholders,



 

83  employees and other Representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the
provisions of this _Section 9.4_, _Article X_ and the Confidentiality
Agreement and (ii) after the Acceptance Time, the provisions of _Section
2.1(e)_, shall, in each case, remain in full force and effect and survive any
termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that no Party shall be
relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
willful and material breach of its covenants or agreements or willful and
material breach of any representation or warranties set forth in this
Agreement made by such Party (including the failure by the Company to pay any
amounts due pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
no event shall any Party be liable for punitive damages.

 

(b) _Company Termination Fee_.

 

(i) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.1(c)(ii)_, the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to
Parent simultaneously with such termination by wire transfer of same day funds
to one or more accounts designated by Parent (or, if such account(s) have not
been designated by Parent prior to such termination, promptly, but in any
event within two (2) Business Days, following the designation thereof in
writing to the Company by Parent).

 

(ii) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
9.1(d)(ii)(A)_ (other than as a result of an Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation), the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent
promptly, but in any event within two (2) Business Days after the date of such
termination, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts
designated by Parent (or, if such account(s) have not been designated by
Parent, promptly, but in any event within two (2) Business Days following the
designation thereof in writing to the Company by Parent).

 

(iii) In the event that (A) this Agreement is terminated (1) by either Parent
or the Company pursuant to  _Section 9.1(b)(ii)(B)_ (and there has been no
Intervening Event Change of Recommendation prior to the expiration date of the
Offer) and prior to the time of such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been publicly announced, commenced or disclosed and shall not have been
irrevocably and in good faith publicly withdrawn, or (2) by Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.1(d)(i)_ and prior to the time of such termination an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been made known to the Company Board or publicly
announced, commenced or disclosed and shall not have been irrevocably and in
good faith withdrawn, and (B) at any time after the execution of this
Agreement and prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the
termination of this Agreement (the " _Follow-On Period_ "), the Company
consummates an Acquisition Proposal or enters into a definitive acquisition
agreement related to an Acquisition Proposal with a Third Party that is
subsequently (1) consummated at any time (for the avoidance of doubt,
including consummation at any time after the Follow-On Period) or (2)
terminated and, in connection with such termination, the Company receives a
fee and/or expense reimbursement (" _Acquisition Proposal Termination Fee_
"), the Company shall, on the date such Acquisition Proposal is consummated,

 



 

84  if at all, or such Acquisition Proposal Termination Fee is received by the
Company, if at all, pay (I) in the case of _Section 9.4(b)(iii)(B)(1)_, the
Company Termination Fee or (II) in the case of _Section 9.4(b)(iii)(B)(2)_
the lesser of (x) the Company Termination Fee and (y) the Acquisition Proposal
Termination Fee, reduced by, in the case of either clause (x) or clause (y),
all out-of-pocket reasonable and documented fees and expenses incurred by or
on behalf of the Company in connection with the applicable Acquisition
Proposal (including any fees and expenses of financial advisors and legal
counsel), in either case to Parent by wire transfer of same day funds to one
or more accounts designated by Parent; _provided_ that, for purposes of this
_Section 9.4(b)(iii)_, (x) all percentages in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be replaced with 50%, (y) the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall exclude any sale or disposition of assets, exclusive license,
collaboration or other co-development, co-promotion, co-marketing or similar
transaction solely with respect to RECOTHROM or IL-21 to a Third Party (but
not both to the same Third Party or its Affiliates), and (z) the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be expanded to include any sale, disposition,
license or transfer, whether direct or indirect, by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary to a Third Party of all or a material portion of the
Companys rights with respect to IFN-lambda.

 

(iv) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by (i) Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.1(d)(ii)(A)_ as a result of an Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 7.5(d)(ii)_ or (ii) the Company or Parent
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(ii)(B)_ and prior to the expiration date of the
Offer the Company Board has made an Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation pursuant to _Section 7.5(d)(ii)_, then the Company shall,
within two (2) Business Days of such termination, pay by wire transfer of same
day funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent a termination fee of
$57,400,000 (the " _Intervening Event Termination Fee_ ") (or, if such
account(s) have not been designated by Parent, promptly, but in any event
within two (2) Business Days following the designation thereof in writing to
the Company by Parent).

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to
pay, or cause to be paid, both the Company Termination Fee and the Intervening
Event Termination Fee, or either the Company Termination Fee or the
Intervening Event Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion.

 

(c) _Acknowledgement_. Each Party acknowledges that (i) the agreements
contained in this _Section 9.4_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of
this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee or
Intervening Event Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of
accurate calculation and, therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to _Section
9.4(b)_ are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) notwithstanding anything to 



 

85  the contrary in this Agreement, and provided Parent has not (A) notified the
Company that Parent is not accepting the Company Termination Fee or
Intervening Event Termination Fee, as applicable, which notification shall
occur, if at all, within five (5) Business Days following the applicable
termination of this Agreement, and (B) refunded such Company Termination Fee
or Intervening Event Termination Fee in full to the Company, within five (5)
Business Days following payment thereof to Parent, if such Company Termination
Fee or Intervening Event Termination Fee has been paid to Parent, and except
as set forth in the last sentence of this  _Section 9.4(c)_, in the event
that any Company Termination Fee or Intervening Event Termination Fee is paid
pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_, Parents right to receive payment of the
Company Termination Fee or Intervening Event Termination Fee, as applicable,
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and its Affiliates and
Representatives against the Company and its Affiliates and Representatives
under this Agreement or arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and upon payment of such amount, none of the
Company or any of its Affiliates or Representatives shall have any liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case whether based on contract,
tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal
or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable
Laws or otherwise, and (iv) without the agreements contained in this _Section
9.4_, Parent and the Company would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to
_Section 9.4(b)_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth
in _Section 9.4(b)_, the Company shall pay to Parent reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Parent in
connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount or portion
thereof at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made through the date of payment.

Section 9.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to  _Section 2.4(d)_, the Parties may, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and, subject to _Section 9.6_, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any
of the agreements or conditions contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after the Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be
made no waiver that by Law requires further approval by the Company
Shareholders under the WBCA without the further approval of such shareholders.
Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

Section 9.6 _Amendment_. Subject to _Section 2.4(d)_, and to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties by
action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any
time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Acceptance Time
or the Company Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) after
the Acceptance Time, there shall be no amendment that decreases the Merger
Consideration or to _Section 7.12_, and (b) after the Company Shareholder
Approval has been 



 

86  obtained, there shall be no amendment that by Law requires further approval
by the Company Shareholders under the WBCA without the further approval of
such shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed by Parent and the Company.

charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent and all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar such Taxes and

88  conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in

transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the end that transactions
contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits,
Company Disclosure Schedule and the other documents delivered pursuant
hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of
the Parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written

Section 10.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement (other than _Article III_ and _Article IV_ and with respect
to matters relating to fiduciary duties of the Company Board) and all claims
or causes of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement (other than _Article III_ and
_Article IV_ and with respect to matters relating to fiduciary duties of the
Company Board) or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(other than _Article III_ and _Article IV_ and with respect to matters
relating to fiduciary duties of the Company Board) (including any claim or
cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or
warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to
enter into this Agreement), shall be construed, performed and enforced in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to its
principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules
would require or permit the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction. 

(b) _Article III_ and _Article IV_ of this Agreement and all claims or causes
of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to _Article III_ and _Article IV_ of this Agreement,
the negotiation, execution or performance of _Article III_ and _Article IV_ of
this Agreement, or matters relating to fiduciary duties of the Company Board,
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Washington without giving effect to its

 



 

89  principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or
rules would require or permit the application of the Laws of another
jurisdiction.

 

(c) Any Action between the Parties against, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought solely and
exclusively in the courts of the State of Delaware, or in any direct appellate
court therefrom; _provided_ that if (and only after) such courts determine
that they lack subject matter jurisdiction over any such legal Action, such
legal Action shall be brought solely and exclusively in the Federal courts of
the United States located in the State of Delaware, or in any direct appellate
court therefrom. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final judgment
(subject to any appeals therefrom) in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party hereby irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in respect of any legal Action
between the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively
do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of any Action between the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby in any such court in accordance with
the provisions of this _Section 10.7_. Each of the Parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an

made a party to or is otherwise involved (including, without limitation, as a
witness) in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or
informal, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the corporation or, while a director or officer, he or she is or
was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, trustee, officer,
partner, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to
employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action
in an official capacity as a director, trustee, officer, partner, employee or
agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director, trustee, officer,
partner, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
corporation, to the full extent permitted by applicable law as then in effect,
against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees,
judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts to be paid in
settlement) actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in
connection therewith, and such indemnification shall continue as to a person
who has ceased to be a director, trustee, officer, partner, employee or agent
and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and
administrators; _provided_ , _however_ , that except as provided in Section B
of this Article with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to
indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking
indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by
such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
board of directors of the corporation. The right to indemnification conferred
in this Article shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be
paid by the corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition, without regard to the
limitations in RCW 23B.08.510 through 23B.08.550, or any other limitation
which may hereafter be enacted to the extent such limitation may
be disregarded if authorized by these Articles of Incorporation, to the full
extent and under all circumstances permitted by applicable law. B. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. If a claim under Section A of this
Article is not paid in full by the corporation within sixty (60) days after a
written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a
claim for expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final
disposition, in which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20) days,
the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to
recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, to the extent successful in whole
or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of
prosecuting such claim. The claimant shall be presumed to be entitled to
indemnification under this Article upon submission of a written claim (and, in
an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition, where the required undertaking
has been tendered to the corporation), and thereafter the corporation shall
have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption that the claimant is so
entitled. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of
directors, independent legal counsel or its shareholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of
or reimbursement or advancement of expenses to the claimant is proper in the
circumstances nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its
board of directors, independent legal counsel or its shareholders) that the
claimant is not entitled to indemnification or to the reimbursement or
advancement of expenses shall be a defense to the action or create a
presumption that the claimant is not so entitled.

 

C. Nonexclusivity of Rights. The right to indemnification and the payment of
expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final
disposition conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of any other
right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute,
provision of the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote
of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

D. Insurance, Contracts and Funding. The corporation may maintain insurance,
at its expense, to protect itself and any director, trustee, officer, partner,
employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability
or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify
such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Act. The
corporation may, without further shareholder action, enter into contracts with
any director, trustee, officer, partner, employee or agent of the corporation
in furtherance of the provisions of this Article and may create a trust fund,
grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a
letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary
to effect indemnification as provided in this Article.

E. Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation. The
corporation may, by action of its board of directors from time to time,
provide indemnification and pay expenses in advance of the final disposition
of a proceeding to employees and agents of the corporation with the same
scope and effect as the provisions of this Article with respect to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the
corporation or pursuant to rights granted pursuant to, or provided by,
the Act or otherwise.

F. Persons Serving Other Entities. Any person who, while a director, officer
or employee of the corporation, is or was serving (a) as a director or
officer of another foreign or domestic corporation of which a majority of the
shares entitled to vote in the election of its  directors is held by the corporation or (b) as a trustee, partner or
otherwise in an executive or management capacity in a partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise of which the corporation or a wholly owned
subsidiary of the corporation is a general partner or has a majority ownership
shall be deemed to be so serving at the request of the corporation and
entitled to indemnification and advancement of expenses under this Article.
