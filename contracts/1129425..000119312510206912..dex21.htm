this Article with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to indemnification, the corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of the corporation. The right to indemnification conferred in this Article shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be paid by the corporation the expenses
incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition, without regard to the limitations in RCW 23B.08.510 through 23B.08.550, or any other limitation which may hereafter be enacted to the extent such limitation may be
disregarded if authorized by these Articles of Incorporation, to the full extent and under all circumstances permitted by applicable law. </FONT></P>

is not paid in full by the corporation within sixty (60)&nbsp;days after a written claim has been received by the corporation, except in the case of a claim for expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition, in
which case the applicable period shall be twenty (20)&nbsp;days, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, to the extent successful in whole or in part, the claimant
shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such claim. The claimant shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Article upon submission of a written claim (and, in an action brought to enforce a claim for
expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition, where the required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation), and thereafter the corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption that
the claimant is so entitled. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel or its shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of or
reimbursement or advancement of expenses to the claimant is proper in the circumstances nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its board of directors, independent legal counsel or its shareholders) that the claimant is not
entitled to indemnification or to the reimbursement or advancement of expenses shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant is not so entitled. </FONT></P>

shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>D. Insurance, Contracts and Funding.</B> The corporation may
maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any director, trustee, officer, partner, employee or agent of the corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or
loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Act. The corporation may, without further shareholder action, enter into contracts with any director, trustee,
officer, partner, employee or agent of the corporation in furtherance of the provisions of this Article and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the
payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification as provided in this Article. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>E. Indemnification of

corporation with the same scope and effect as the provisions of this Article with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the corporation or pursuant to rights granted pursuant to, or provided by, the
