Buyers delivery of the Final Calculations, the Seller Representative may give
Buyer written notice stating the Sellers objections (an " _Objection Notice_
") to the Final Calculations. Such Objection Notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the amount of any objection and the basis therefor. During
such 30-day period, the Seller Representative shall have reasonable access to
the Companys books and records and personnel and accountants as necessary
for purposes of verifying the Final Calculations. Any determination set forth
in the Final Calculations that is not objected to in an Objection Notice shall
be deemed acceptable and shall be final and binding upon Buyer and the
Sellers upon delivery of the Objection Notice. If the Seller Representative
does not give Buyer an Objection Notice within such 30-day period, then the
Final Calculations shall be conclusive and binding upon Buyer and the Seller
Representative and the Final Calculations shall constitute the Final
Calculations for purposes of _Section 2.6(d)_ below.

 



14 (c) _Independent Accountant_. Following Buyers receipt of any Objection
Notice, the Seller Representative and Buyer shall attempt to negotiate in
good faith to resolve such dispute. In the event that the Seller
Representative and Buyer fail to agree on all of the Seller Representatives
proposed adjustments set forth in the Objection Notice within thirty (30)
days after Buyer receives the Objection Notice, the Seller Representative and
Buyer agree that KPMG LLP or, if such Person is unable or unwilling to act as
the Independent Accountant hereunder, such other nationally recognized
accounting firm that is mutually acceptable to Buyer and the Seller
Representative and is willing to serve in such capacity hereunder (the "
_Independent Accountant_ "), shall, if and when requested to do so by either
Buyer or the Seller Representative in writing to the Independent Accountant
with concurrent notice to the other party, make the final determination of the
Final Calculations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Buyer and
the Seller Representative each shall provide the Independent Accountant with
their respective determinations of the Final Calculations and such other
written submissions, presentations and supporting material as each of Buyer
and the Seller Representative deems necessary and appropriate. The
Independent Accountant shall make a determination of the Final Calculations as
soon as practicable after its engagement, and such determination shall be
final and binding on the Sellers and Buyer and shall be within the range
proposed by Buyer and the Seller Representative in the Final Calculations and
the Objection Notice. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the
Independent Accountant shall be limited to whether such calculation was done
in accordance with the terms hereof, the accounting methods and procedures
used to prepare the Final Calculations, and whether there were mathematical
errors in the calculation of any of the Final Calculations, and the
Independent Accountant shall not to make any other determination. The
Independent Accountant shall make its determination based solely on written
submissions, presentations and supporting material provided by Buyer and the
Seller Representative and not pursuant to any independent review. The
Independent Accountant shall act as an expert, not an arbitrator. The fees,
costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be allocated between
Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, based upon the
percentage of the aggregate dollar value of the items set forth in the
Objection Notice not awarded to Buyer and the Seller Representative,
respectively, bears to the amount actually contested by such party. For
example, if the Seller Representative claims that the appropriate adjustments
are $1,000 greater than the amount determined by Buyer and if the Independent
Accountant ultimately resolves such items by awarding to the Seller
Representative $300 of the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs
and expenses of the Independent Accountant will be allocated 30% (i.e., 300 ÷
1,000) to Buyer and 70% (i.e., 700 ÷ 1,000) to the Seller Representative.
During the review by the Independent Accountant, Buyer, the Seller
Representative and their respective representatives shall make available to
the Independent Accountant interviews with such individuals and such
information, books and records and work papers as may be reasonably required
by the Independent Accountant to fulfill its obligations under this _Section
2.6(c)_. The Independent Accountants determination of the Final Calculations
shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of
Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and comparable state rules of
evidence, and all negotiations, submissions to the Independent Accountant, and
presentations under this _Section 2.6(c)_ shall be treated as confidential
information. The Independent Accountant shall be bound by a mutually
agreeable confidentiality agreement. The

 



15  decision rendered pursuant to this _Section 2.6(c)_ may be filed as a
judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Either party may seek
specific enforcement or take other necessary legal action to enforce any
decision under this _Section 2.6(c)_. The other partys only defense to such
a request for specific enforcement or other legal action shall be fraud by or
upon the Independent Accountant. Absent such fraud, such other party shall
reimburse the party seeking enforcement for all of its expenses related to the
enforcement of the Independent Accountants determination.

 

(d) _Payment of Adjusted Amounts_.

 

(i) If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is negative, then (A) Buyer and the
Seller Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to (A) release to Buyer
from the Adjustment Escrow Fund an amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment
Amount and (B) release to HoldCo any remaining portion of the Adjustment
Escrow Fund (including any accrued interest thereon);  _provided_ , _that_ ,
if the Adjustment Escrow Fund is insufficient, then Buyer may recover the

(b) The Earn-Out Amount for each Earn-Out Period, if any, shall be determined

(c) The Earn-Out Amount shall be calculated and agreed upon by the parties as

17 (ii) On or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day following Buyers delivery of
the Earn-Out Statement, the Seller Representative may give Buyer written
notice stating the Seller Representatives objections (an " _Earn-Out
Objection Notice_ ") to any of the calculations included in the Earn-Out
Statement. Such Earn-Out Objection Notice shall specify in reasonable detail
the amount of any objection and the basis therefor. During such
30-day period, the Seller Representative shall have reasonable access to the
Companys books and records and personnel and accountants as necessary for

determination set forth in such calculation that is not objected to in the

binding upon Buyer, HoldCo, the Sellers and the Option Holders upon delivery
of the Earn-Out Objection Notice. If the Seller Representative does not give
Buyer an Earn-Out Objection Notice within such 30-day period, then the
calculations set forth in the Earn-Out Statement shall be conclusive and
binding upon Buyer and the Seller Representative and the Earn-Out Amount if
any, shall be deemed to be final and conclusive. If the Seller Representative
timely delivers an Earn-Out Objection Notice, then such dispute shall be
resolved fully, finally and exclusively in accordance with the procedures set
forth in  _Section 2.6(c)_.

(iii) Within five (5) Business Days after the Earn-Out Amount, if any, is
finally determined in accordance with this _Section 2.7(c)_, Buyer will pay
such Earn-Out Amount to HoldCo;

(d) Buyer and the Seller Representative hereby agree to hold meetings on a
quarterly basis (or such other times as mutually agreed) to discuss progress
toward achieving the Revenue milestones set forth in _Section 2.7(b)_ and
providing the budgeted expenditures and resources set forth in _Schedule
2.7(f)_.

(e) The Earn-Out Amount shall represent only a contingent right to receive a
cash payment from Buyer, subject to the terms set forth herein. The Earn-Out
Amount shall not possess any attributes of capital stock and shall not entitle
HoldCo, any Seller or any Option Holder to any rights of any kind other than
as specifically set forth herein. The right to receive a portion of the Earn-
Out Amount distributed to HoldCo is personal to each Seller and each Option
Holder and is and shall remain nontransferable for any reason other than by
operation of Law or by will or the Laws of descent and distribution. Any
attempted assignment, pledge, hypothecation, transfer or other disposition of
the right to receive an Earn-Out Amount distributed to HoldCo by any Seller or
Option Holder (other than as set forth in the preceding sentence) shall
be null and void.

(f) The Company and the Sellers acknowledge that, after the Closing, (i) the
Company will be a wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer and, as a consequence,
Buyer will exercise direct control over the governance and financial control
of the Company and indirect control over the Companys day to day business
operations in the same manner as Buyer customarily exercises over the
business operations of its various product and service offerings, including
the product and service offerings of Digi Smart Solutions, (ii) there can be
no assurance that any Earn-Out Amount will be received, and (iii) Buyer
owes no fiduciary duty, express or implied, to HoldCo, the Sellers or Option
Holders, such as an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, in the
exercise of its control over Digi Smart Solutions, its direct control over the
governance and financial control of the Company and the indirect control over
the

 



18  Companys day to day business operations but, rather, the parties intend the
express provisions of this Agreement to govern their contractual relationship
with respect to the Earn-Out Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during
the Earn-Out Period, Buyer agrees and covenants that Buyer shall (X) exercise
its control over Digi Smart Solutions and its indirect control over the
Companys day to day business operations taking into consideration the
operational and budgetary forecasts and guidelines set forth in _Schedule
2.7(f)_ ; (Y) will respond to reasonable requests of the Seller Representative
to provide the personnel and other resources set forth in  _Schedule 2.7(f)_
while taking into account performance against the forecasts and guidelines set
forth in _Schedule 2.7(f)_ ; and (Z) not take any actions in bad faith in its
exercise of indirect control over the Companys business operations which are
intentionally undertaken with the express purpose of, and have the actual
effect of, reducing the Earn-Out Amount.

 

Section 2.8 _Seller Representative_.

 

(a) Each Seller and HoldCo, by virtue of such Sellers and HoldCos execution
of this Agreement, hereby irrevocably appoint the Seller Representative, and
the Seller Representative hereby accepts such appointment, as agent and
attorney-in-fact for each Seller and HoldCo, with full power and authority in
the name of and for and on behalf of each such Seller and HoldCo, to serve as
the Seller Representative under this Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents and any other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby and to
exercise the power and authority to act on behalf of, and in the name of,
HoldCo or such Seller with respect to all matters relating to this Agreement,
the other Transaction Documents or such other agreements, and the transactions
contemplated hereunder or thereunder (including the execution and delivery of
the Escrow Agreement on behalf of the Sellers and HoldCo). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Seller Representative is hereby granted
the power and authority by each Seller and HoldCo to (i) negotiate and enter
into amendments to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and any
other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby for itself (in his capacity as
the Seller Representative) and on behalf of such Seller and HoldCo; (ii) act
on each Sellers and HoldCos behalf in any dispute, litigation, or
arbitration involving _Article IX_ or the other provisions of this Agreement,
the other Transaction Documents or such other agreements or any document
delivered to the Seller Representative in such capacity pursuant hereto or
thereto; (iii) object to any Claims by the Buyer or the Buyer Indemnitees
against the Escrow Fund; (iv) acquire insurance with respect of any potential
Claims made by an Indemnified Party; (v) employ and obtain the advice
of legal counsel, accountants and other professional advisors as the Seller
Representative, in his sole discretion, deems necessary or advisable in the
performance of his duties as the Seller Representative and to rely on their
advice and counsel; (vi) incur expenses, including fees of brokers, attorneys
and accountants as the Seller Representative, in his sole discretion, deems
advisable in the performance of his duties as the Seller Representative; (vii)
authorize the release of the Seller Representative Amount or the Escrow

or refrain from doing all such further acts and things, and execute all such
documents, as the Seller Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



19 (b) The Seller Representative shall not be liable to any Seller or HoldCo for
any act done or omitted hereunder in connection with the acceptance,
performance, or administration of his duties hereunder, except with respect to
his own willful fraud or bad faith, and for this purpose any act done or
omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of the
absence of willful fraud and bad faith. The Sellers and HoldCo shall jointly
and severally indemnify the Seller Representative (in his capacity as such)
and hold him harmless against any loss, liability, or expense incurred by him
(other than as a direct result of his own willful fraud or bad faith) on his
part arising out of or in connection with the acceptance, performance, or
administration of his duties hereunder.

 

(c) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver the Seller Representative Amount to a
non-interest bearing bank account designated by the Seller Representative.
The Seller Representative Amount shall be controlled solely by the Seller
Representative and the Seller Representative shall use the Seller
Representative Amount solely to pay the costs and expenses, if any, incurred
by the Seller Representative in the performance of its obligations as the
Seller Representative hereunder, including initiating, defending or resolving
any claims for indemnification by the Indemnified Parties pursuant to Article
IX and determining the Final Calculations.

(d) Buyer is entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any
kind whatsoever) (i) upon any document executed or purported to be executed
on behalf of any Seller or HoldCo by the Seller Representative as fully
binding upon the Sellers and HoldCo, and (ii) upon any other decision, act,
consent or instruction on behalf of any Seller or HoldCo by the Seller
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of all
Sellers and HoldCo. Buyer is hereby relieved from any liability to any Person
for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Seller Representative.

Section 2.9 _Withholding_. Each of Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder or any other provision of
applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer or
the Company, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Persons in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

identifiable information, or has notified, either voluntarily or as required
by Law, any affected individual, any Governmental Entity or the media of any

27 Section 3.11 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) _Section 3.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true and
correct list of every plan, fund, Contract, program and arrangement (formal
or informal, whether written or not and whether by employment or other
individual agreement, such as option Contracts, or not) (each such plan, fund,
Contract, program and arrangement required to be set forth on  _Section
3.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, collectively, the " _Employee
Plans_ ") that the Company or any other ERISA Affiliate currently sponsors,
maintains or contributes to, is required to contribute to, or has or could
reasonably be expected to have any liability of any nature with respect to,
whether known or unknown, direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, for the
benefit of present or former employees of the Company and/or their ERISA
Affiliates (the " _Employees_ ") including those intended to provide: (i)
medical, surgical, health care, hospitalization, dental, vision, life
insurance, death, disability, legal services, severance, sickness, accident or
other welfare benefits (whether or not defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA),
(ii) pension, profit sharing, stock bonus, retirement, supplemental retirement
or deferred compensation benefits (whether or not tax qualified and whether or
not defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), (iii) bonus, incentive compensation,
option, stock appreciation right, phantom stock or stock purchase benefits or
(iv) salary continuation, paid time off, supplemental unemployment, current or
deferred compensation (other than current salary or wages paid in the form of

in Section 3(3) of ERISA) under which the Company, or any other corporation or
trade or business that is treated as a single employer with the Company as
determined under Sections 414(b), (c) (m) or (o) of the Code (each entity
other than the Company, an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ").

 

(b) None of the Employee Plans is a plan intended to be qualified under Code
Section 401(a). None of the Employee Plans is a plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. None of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate
has any liability resulting from past membership in a Code Section 414
controlled group of corporations. No Employee Plan is a multiple employer
plan or multiemployer plan under Section 413(c) or 414(f) of the Code and none
of the Company or any other ERISA Affiliate has ever contributed to a
"multiemployer plan" (as such term is defined in Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3)
of ERISA).

(c) No employer other than the Company or an ERISA Affiliate is permitted to
participate or participates in the Employee Plans. No leased employees (as
defined in Section 414(n) of the Code) or independent contractors are eligible
for, or participate in, any Employee Plan.

 

(d) There are no Employee Plans which promise or provide health, life or other
welfare benefits to retirees or former employees of the Company and/or any
ERISA Affiliates, or which provide severance benefits to Employees, except as
otherwise required by Section 4980B of the Code or comparable state statute
which provides for continuing health care coverage. _Section 3.11(d)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete list of each individual who
elected to continue any eligible Employee Plan under Section 4980B of the Code
or similar state Law including the name, Employee Plans continued, the
beginning date of continuation and expected end date.

 



28 (e) With respect to all Employee Plans, to the extent that the following
documents exist, the Company has furnished Buyer with true and complete
copies of: (i) the most recent determination letter, if any, received by the
Company and/or their ERISA Affiliates from the IRS, (ii) all pending
applications for rulings, determinations, opinions, no action letters and the

the Annual Report/Return (Form Series 5500) with financial statements, if any,
and attachments for the three most recent plan years, (iv) Employee Plan
documents, summary plan descriptions, trust agreements, insurance Contracts,
individual agreements, service agreements and all related Contracts and
documents (including any employee summaries and material employee
communications), and (v) all closing letters, audit finding letters, revenue
agent findings and similar documents.

(f) Each Employee Plan is in compliance with its terms and in compliance with
the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Law
(including all reporting and disclosure requirements). Each Employee Plan that
is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) has
received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service or
is maintained under a prototype or volume submitter plan and with respect to
which the Company is entitled to rely upon a favorable opinion or advisory
letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service. There is no circumstance that
will result in the revocation of such favorable determination letter, opinion
letter or advisory letter. All contributions, premiums, fees or charges due
and owing to or in respect of any Employee Plan for periods on or before the
Closing have been paid in full by the Company or an ERISA Affiliate prior to
the Closing in accordance with the terms of such Employee Plan and all
applicable Laws, and no Taxes are owing as a result of any Employee Plan. None
of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate (if any) has engaged in a transaction in
connection with which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate reasonably could be
expected to become subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to
Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant to Code Section 4975
or 4976. There are no pending, or, to Knowledge of the Company, threatened
or anticipated audits, investigations, claims, suits, grievances or other
proceedings, and there are no facts that could reasonably give rise thereto,
involving, directly or indirectly, any Employee Plan, or any rights or
benefits thereby (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or
against any of the Employee Plans or any trusts related thereto which are
reasonably likely to result in a liability. Except as set forth in _Section
3.11(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no actions, including
audits, requests for information, investigations, complaints, charges, or
claims with respect to the Company Employees or independent contractors
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company
with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Labor, the
IRS, the National Labor Relations Board, or any other state, county, city or
other political subdivision or other Governmental Entity.

any increase in contributions or benefits under any Employee Plan that would
become effective either on or after the Closing Date.

 



29 (h) No Employee Plan is currently under audit or examination by the IRS or the
DOL.

 

(i) Except as set forth in _Section 3.11(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in any
payment (including severance, termination, change in control payments,
unemployment compensation, golden parachute, forgiveness of indebtedness or
otherwise) becoming due to current or former employees of the Company or
ERISA Affiliates (including any Key Employee) from the Company or ERISA
Affiliate under any Employment Agreements or Employee Plan or otherwise; (ii)
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Employment Agreement or
Employment Plan or otherwise; or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time
of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

 

(j) The Company and/or its ERISA Affiliates can terminate each Employee Plan
without further liability to the Company and/or its ERISA Affiliates, other
than benefits described in such Employee Plans which vested prior to
termination and other than costs in the normal course associated with
terminating any Employee Plans, including costs necessary to satisfy any
notice periods described in such Employee Plan documents or funding vehicles.
No action or omission of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate or any director,
officer, employee, or agent thereof in any way restricts, impairs or prohibits
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate or any successor from amending, merging,
or terminating any Employee Plan in accordance with the express terms of any
such Employee Plan and applicable Law.

 

(k) There are no facts or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to,
directly or indirectly, subject the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to any (i)
excise Tax or other liability under Chapters 43, 46 or 47 of Subtitle D of the
Code, (ii) penalty Tax or other liability under Chapter 68 of Subtitle F of
the Code or (iii) civil penalty, damages or other liabilities arising under
Section 502 of ERISA.

(l) Benefits provided to participants under each Employee Plan (other than a
tax qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code or a plan established
under Section 408(p) of the Code) are provided exclusively from insurance
Contracts or the general assets of the Company and/or the ERISA
Affiliates. None of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has established or
contributed to, is required to contribute to or has or could reasonably be
expected to have any liability of any nature, whether known or unknown, direct
or indirect, fixed or contingent, with respect to any "voluntary employees
beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code,
"welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code,
"qualified asset account" within the meaning of Section 419A of the Code, or
"multiple employer welfare arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(40) of
ERISA.

arrangement that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (within the
meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been in documentary and
operational compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the Code
and all applicable IRS guidance promulgated thereunder.

and effect. There are no royalties, fees, honoraria or other payments payable
by the Company to any Person by reason of the ownership, development,
modification, use, license, sublicense, sale, distribution or other
disposition of the Company Intellectual Property, other than salaries and
sales commissions paid to employees and sales agents, and customary license
fees charged by third party licensors pursuant to a Contract furnished to
Buyer, in each case, in the ordinary course of business. The Company has the
exclusive, unrestricted right to sue for past, present, and future
infringement of the Owned Intellectual Property.

Property used in or necessary for the conduct of the Company Business, and is
sufficient for such purposes.

(e) Neither the conduct of the Company Business nor the Company Intellectual
Property (or use or other exploitation of it) has infringed upon,
misappropriated, violated or engaged in unfair competition with, or is
infringing, misappropriating, violating or engaging in any unfair competition
with, any Intellectual Property of any Person. There is, and has been, no
Action pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, alleging any
such infringement, misappropriation, violation or unfair competition against
the Company or otherwise concerning the ownership, validity, registerability,
enforceability, violation or use of, or licensed right to use, any Company
Intellectual Property. No valid basis or other facts or circumstances exist
for any such Action, or threatened Action. Except as set forth in _Section
3.15(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there has been no demand that the
Company refrain from using any Intellectual Property of any Person or any
notice of patent rights that might be relevant to the Company Business or

Company, no third party is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise
violating, or has infringed or misappropriated or otherwise violated, any
Owned Intellectual Property and no such claim is pending or threatened
against any Person by the Company. No Company Intellectual Property is subject
to any outstanding order, judgment, decree, stipulation or agreement
restricting the use or licensing thereof by the Company.

(f) The Company takes and has taken commercially reasonable actions at least
consistent with industry-standard practice to protect their rights in the
Company Intellectual Property and to maintain the confidentiality, integrity
and security of all information that constitutes material trade secrets, know-
how and confidential information stored or contained in the Company
Intellectual Property or transmitted thereby from any unauthorized use,
access, disclosure, destruction or modification, and no such use, access,
disclosure, destruction or modification has occurred. The Company has at all
times enforced a policy of requiring officers, directors, employees, agents,
consultants and contractors with responsibility for the development or
implementation of Intellectual Property or who may be exposed to any trade
secret, know-how or other confidential information to execute proprietary

pursuant to a written assignment agreement.

(g) Each item of Company Intellectual Property will be owned, licensed
and available for use on identical terms following the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby as such items were owned, licensed and
available for use to the Company prior to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and neither the execution, delivery and performance by
the Company nor the consummation of any transactions contemplated hereby shall
result in the loss or impairment of, or give rise to any right of a third
party to terminate, any rights of the Company in the Company Intellectual
Property.

(h) No software owned (or purported to be owned) by the Company contains any
programming code, documentation or other materials or development
environments that embody Intellectual Property rights of any Person other than
the Company. No source code for any such software that is owned by the Company
has been delivered, licensed, or made available to any escrow agent or other
Person who is not, as of the date of this Agreement, an employee of the
Company. No Person has any right to access or use any source code for any such
software that is owned by the Company, and no event has occurred, and no
circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) will, or would reasonably be expected to, nor will this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, result in the disclosure or
release of such source code by the Company, the escrow agent(s), or any other
Person to any Person. The Company is in possession of, or has access to, the
source code for, and documentation applicable to, each current version of the
software owned by the Company.

(i) The Company has sufficient rights to use all software, including
middleware, databases, and systems, information technology equipment, and
associated documentation used or held for use in connection with the operation
of the Company Business (the " _IT Assets_ ") all of which rights shall
survive unchanged the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
The IT Assets operate and perform in all material respects in accordance with
their documentation and functional specifications and are sufficient and/or
configurable to effectively perform all operations necessary for the current
operation of the Company Business, and all IT Assets are owned or licensed
under valid licenses and operated by and are under the control of the Company.
The Company does not use, rely on or contract with any Person to provide
services bureau, outsourcing or other computer processing services to the
Company except as described in _Section 3.15(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. The IT Assets have not materially malfunctioned or failed within the

viruses, bugs, faults or other devices or effects that (i) enable or assist
any Person to access without authorization or disable or erase the IT Assets,
or (ii) otherwise materially adversely affect the functionality of the IT
Assets. The Company has taken commercially reasonable steps to provide for the
remote-site back-up of data and information critical to the conduct of the
Company Business and has in place commercially reasonable disaster recovery
and business continuity plans, procedures and facilities. To the Knowledge of
the Company, no Person has gained unauthorized access to any IT Assets during
the past three years. The Company has maintained, continues to maintain, and

against the unauthorized access, disclosure, destruction, loss, or alteration
of customer data or information in its possession or control that comply with

standards.

ERISA, maintained from and after the Closing by Buyer or any of its ERISA
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) and any vacation, paid
time off and severance plans, but excluding any equity based plan of Buyer or
its ERISA Affiliates, and to the extent permissible under such benefits of

or to give any employee the right to be retained in the employment of the
Company or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, Buyer and its
Affiliates), or to interfere with any of the Company or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates) right to terminate

_that_ if the Company is so restricted, it shall notify Buyer
that information or records are being withheld and provide Buyer with as much
information as possible with respect to such information or records.

attorney-client or attorney work product privilege, each will consult the
other with regard to information relating to the other that appears in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity
in connection with the applications or other filings contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of the Company, the Sellers and Buyer further agrees to

any antitrust Law, (vi) pay any sums or concede anything of value; or (vii)
take any action as a result of any "second request" or any request for

Returns, to the extent that such Taxes (i) are apportioned to the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and (ii) are not specifically
reflected in the calculation of Taxes Payable, at least five (5) days prior to
the due date (including extensions) for filing such Straddle Returns. In the
case of any Straddle Period, (i) Taxes imposed on a periodic basis shall be
apportioned between the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date and the portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date
on a daily pro-rata basis, and (ii) all other Taxes shall be apportioned
between the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the
portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date on a closing
of the books basis.

notify the Seller Representative in writing of such Pre-Closing Tax Contest.

the Seller Representative notifies Buyer that the Seller Representative will
not control the defense of a Pre-Closing Tax Contest, or (ii) the Seller
Representative fails to defend a Pre-Closing Tax Contest in a commercially
reasonable manner, then Buyer shall have the right to control the defense of
such Pre-Closing Tax Contest at the Seller Representatives expense, in which
event the Seller Representative agrees to fully cooperate with Buyer.

(f) Buyer, the Company and the Seller Representative shall cooperate fully, as
and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with
the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 6.9_ and
any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include signing any Tax Returns, amended Tax Returns,
claims or other documents necessary to settle any Tax controversy, executing
powers of attorney, retaining and (upon the other partys request) providing
records and information which are reasonably available and relevant to any
such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder.

event later than five (5) days after receipt by Buyer or the Company or any of
their Affiliates, Buyer will, and will cause the Company to deliver and pay
over, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, such refund of Taxes to
the Seller.

(i) The Seller Representative shall be liable for and shall pay in a timely
manner all Transfer Taxes, regardless of the person on whom such Taxes are
imposed by Law. The Seller Representative shall prepare and file any Tax
Return required to be filed in connection with such Taxes and Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate with the Seller Representative in connection with the
preparation and filing of such Tax Return.

date hereof, Sellers and the Company shall give Buyer meaningful opportunity
to review and comment on drafts of such documentation effecting the
Restructuring prior to their finalization, execution and filing.

other costs of recovery (including any deductible amount) and any resultant
increase in insurance premiums of the Indemnified Party) from any insurer
(excluding self-insurance or captive insurance) or other Person then liable
for such Losses.

 



62 (ii) If any Indemnified Parties receive any amounts under insurance coverage
or from any Person with respect to Losses sustained at any time subsequent to
any payment to such Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Article IX_, then
such Indemnified Parties shall promptly reimburse the applicable parties

any representation or warranty, then the claim asserted in such notice shall
survive the applicable expiration date until such time as such claim is fully
and finally resolved.

 

Section 9.4 _Claim Procedure_.

 

(a) _Non-Third Party Claims_. If a claim for Losses (a " _Claim_ ") is to be
made by any Indemnified Party that does not involve a third party, such
Indemnified Party shall give written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the
Seller Representative if the Claim Notice is being given by a Buyer
Indemnified Party and to Buyer if the Claim Notice is being given by an
Seller Indemnified Party, in each case, within a reasonable time after such
Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact, condition or event giving rise to
Losses for which indemnification may be sought under _Section 9.2_, which
Claim Notice shall specify in reasonable detail, to the extent reasonably
known and practicable at such time, the amount of the Claim and each
individual item of Loss included in the amount so stated and the basis for
indemnification. The failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely notice
hereunder shall not affect such Indemnified Partys rights to indemnification
hereunder, except to the extent the applicable Indemnifying Parties are
actually prejudiced by such delay or failure, in which case the amount of
reimbursement to which the Indemnified Party is entitled shall be reduced by
the amount, if any, by which the Indemnified Partys Losses would have been
less had such Claim Notice been timely given. If the applicable Indemnifying
Parties notify the Indemnified Party that they do not dispute the Claim
described in such Claim Notice or fail to respond within thirty (30) days
following receipt of such Claim Notice, the Losses identified in the
Claim Notice will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying
Party under _Section 9.2(a)_ or _Section 9.2(b)_, as applicable. If the
applicable Indemnifying Parties dispute their liability with respect to such
Claim or the estimated amount of such Losses pursuant to this _Section 9.4_
within thirty (30) days following receipt of such Claim Notice, the parties
shall attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute; _provided_ , _that_ if
such dispute has not been resolved within sixty (60) days following receipt
of such Claim Notice, then the Indemnifying Parties and the Indemnified
Parties may seek legal redress in

 



63  accordance with _Article X_. In the event the parties seek legal redress,
the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party its
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred in connection with
any such action. In the event the Seller Representative is such prevailing
party such expenses shall be delivered to the Seller Representative to be held
in escrow as part of the Seller Representative Amount in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

(b) _Third Party Claims_.

 

(i) If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion of any Claim or
the commencement of any Action by a third party with respect to a matter
subject to indemnity hereunder, notice thereof (a " _Third Party Notice_ ")
shall promptly be given to the Seller Representative if the Third Party Notice
is being given by a Buyer Indemnified Party and to Buyer if the Third Party
Notice is being given by a Seller Indemnified Party, which Third Party Notice
shall specify in reasonable detail, to the extent reasonably known and
practicable at such time, the amount of the Claim and each individual item of
Loss included in the amount so stated and the basis for indemnification, and
will include copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
served on or received by the Indemnified Party. The failure of any Indemnified
Party to give timely notice hereunder shall not affect such Indemnified
Partys rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent such delay
or failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Parties ability to defend
such Claim or Action, and the amount of reimbursement to which the
Indemnified Party is entitled shall be reduced by the amount, if any, by which
the Indemnified Partys Losses would have been less had such Third Party
Notice been timely delivered. After receipt of a Third Party Notice, the
Indemnifying Parties shall have the right, but not the obligation, by
providing written notice to the Indemnified Party, subject to _Section
9.4(b)(iii)_, to (A) take control of the defense and investigation of such
Claim or Action at the Indemnifying Partys sole costs and expense, (B)
employ and engage attorneys of its, his or her own choice (subject to the
approval of the Indemnified Party, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) to handle and defend the same, at the
Indemnifying Parties sole cost and expense, and (C) compromise or settle such
claim, which compromise or settlement shall be made only with the written
consent of the Indemnified Party;  _provided_ , _that_ such consent will not
be required if such settlement includes an unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party and provides solely for payment of monetary damages for
which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified in full under this Agreement.

(ii) In the event that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the
Indemnified Party against a Claim or Action, (A) the Indemnifying Party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to defend diligently such Claim or Action, (B)
the Indemnified Party, prior to the period in which the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of such matter, may take such reasonable actions to
preserve any and all rights with respect to such matter, without such actions
being construed as a waiver of the Indemnified Partys rights to defense and
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, but with such actions not being
determinative of the amount of any Losses, and (C) the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to have agreed that it shall indemnify the Indemnified Party
for all Losses resulting from such Claim or Action pursuant to and subject to
the conditions of this _Article IX_. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate in
all reasonable respects, at the Indemnifying Parties request, with the
Indemnifying Parties and their attorneys in the investigation, trial and
defense of such Claim or Action and any appeal arising therefrom,

 



64  including, if appropriate and related to such Claim or Action, in making any
counterclaim against the third party claimant, or any cross complaint against
any Person, in each case, at the expense of the Indemnifying Parties. The
Indemnified Party may, at its own sole cost and expense, monitor and further
participate in (but not control) the investigation, trial and defense of such
Claim or Action and any appeal arising therefrom;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
_that_ if (A) the employment of counsel shall have been authorized in writing
by the Indemnifying Parties in connection with the defense of such action or
claim, (B) the Indemnifying Parties shall not have employed, or are
prohibited under this _Section 9.4_ from employing, counsel in the defense of
such action or claim, or (C) such Indemnified Party shall have reasonably
concluded that a conflict or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Parties or there may be defenses
available to the Indemnified Party that are contrary to, or inconsistent with,
those available to the Indemnifying Parties, then, in any such event, the fees
and expenses of not more than one additional counsel for the Indemnified
Party shall be borne by the Indemnifying Parties.

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (A) the Indemnifying Parties elect
not to assume such defense and investigation or do not acknowledge in writing
within a reasonable period, but no later than ten (10) days, after receipt of
the Third Party Notice their obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party
against any Losses arising from such Claim or Action, (B) fail to actively and
diligently, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party,
conduct the defense of the action, (C) such Claim or Action seeks an
injunction or other equitable remedies in respect of the Indemnified Party or
its business or involves any Governmental Entity, (D) such Claim or Action is
reasonably likely to result in liabilities that, taken with other then-
existing claims under this _Article IX_, would not be fully indemnified
hereunder, (E) the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that an
actual or potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Parties in connection with the defense of the Claim or Action,
(F) such Claim or Action seeks a finding or admission of a violation of Law or
violation of the rights of any Person by the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates, or (G) such Claim or Action relates to any ongoing business of the
Indemnified Party (which, in the case of Buyer, shall include the Company),
then the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation (upon
delivering notice to such effect to the Indemnifying Parties) to retain
separate counsel of its choosing, defend such Claim or Action and have the
sole power to direct and control such defense (all at the cost and expense of
the Indemnifying Parties); it being understood that the Indemnified Partys
right to indemnification for a Claim or Action shall not be adversely affected
by assuming the defense of such Claim or Action.

 

(iv) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid production of confidential information
(consistent with Law), and to cause all communications among employees,
counsel and others representing any party to a Claim or Action to be made so
as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

 

Section 9.5 _Indemnification Payments_. Any payment under this _Article IX_
shall be treated as an adjustment to the purchase price for Tax purposes and
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

 



65 Section 9.6 _Escrow Amount Release_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Article IX_, and other
than for Losses resulting from claims brought on the basis of willful fraud
or intentional misrepresentation, in the event that any Buyer Indemnified
Party has a Claim for indemnification against the Sellers pursuant to _Article
IX_, the Buyer Indemnified Party shall recover the amount of such Claim from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and if the Indemnity Escrow Fund is insufficient,
such Buyer Indemnified Party may recover the amount of the deficiency from the
Sellers individually, severally and not jointly (pro rata in accordance
with each Sellers applicable Unit Distribution Percentage.

(b) On the first Business Day that is twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date (the " _Release Date_ "), Buyer and the Seller Representative shall cause
the Escrow Agent to pay to HoldCo any remaining portion of the Indemnity
Escrow Fund (including any accrued interest thereon), less any amounts
that are subject to pending claims made by any Buyer Indemnified Party under
this _Article IX_ prior to 11:59 p.m. on the Release Date. If any Claim made
by any Buyer Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_ is still pending as
of the Release Date, the Escrow Agent, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, will retain a portion of the Escrow Amount in an amount equal to
the Losses identified in any unresolved notice delivered pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement until such claim has been satisfied or otherwise resolved,
at which point, Buyer and the Seller Representative shall jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to pay to HoldCo any remaining balance in the Indemnity Escrow
Fund not used to satisfy the indemnification rights of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties under this _Article IX_. The limitations on liability identified in
_Section 9.3(a)_ and _Section 9.3(b)_ shall apply to any otherwise permitted
Claim made by a Buyer Indemnified Party after the Release Date resulting from
or arising out of any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any of the Surviving
Claims.

 

Section 9.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. The parties acknowledge and agree that,
following the Closing, (a) the indemnification obligations of the Sellers
under this _Article IX_ (including without the limitation the Cap on
liability set forth in _Section 9.3(b)(i)_ or _Section 9.3(b)(ii)_ of this
Agreement) and the remedies set forth herein shall constitute the sole and
exclusive obligations of the Sellers and remedies of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, regardless of the theory or cause of action resulting in or giving
rise to said obligation or liability, for any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty of the Company or the Sellers set forth in this
Agreement, and any breach, non-fulfillment or default in the performance of
any covenant or agreement of the Company or the Sellers set forth in
this Agreement and (b) the indemnification obligations of Buyer under this
_Article IX_ (including without limitation the limits on liability set forth
in _Section 9.3(b)(ii)_ of this Agreement) and the remedies set forth
herein shall constitute the sole and exclusive obligations of the Buyer and
remedies of the Seller Indemnified Parties, regardless of the theory or cause

remedy given such party under this Agreement or otherwise available to such

demand exact compliance with the terms hereof, unless such waiver is set
forth in writing and executed by such party.

Section 10.11 _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed, shall be

breaching this agreement. The parties further agree that (a) by seeking the
remedies provided for in this  _Section 10.15_, a party shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available
