within the range proposed by Buyer and the Seller Representative in the Final Calculations and the Objection Notice. The scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Independent Accountant shall be limited to whether such calculation was done in
accordance with the terms hereof, the accounting methods and procedures used to prepare the Final Calculations, and whether there were mathematical errors in the calculation of any of the Final Calculations, and the Independent Accountant shall not

review. The Independent Accountant shall act as an expert, not an arbitrator. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, based upon the percentage
of the aggregate dollar value of the items set forth in the Objection Notice not awarded to Buyer and the Seller Representative, respectively, bears to the amount actually contested by such party. For example, if the Seller Representative claims
that the appropriate adjustments are $1,000 greater than the amount determined by Buyer and if the Independent Accountant ultimately resolves such items by awarding to the Seller Representative $300 of the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs and
expenses of the Independent Accountant will be allocated 30% (i.e., 300 &divide; 1,000) to Buyer and 70% (i.e., 700 &divide; 1,000) to the Seller Representative. During the review by the Independent Accountant, Buyer, the Seller Representative and

obligations under this <U>Section&nbsp;2.6(c)</U>. The Independent Accountant&#146;s determination of the Final Calculations shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of Rule&nbsp;408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence
