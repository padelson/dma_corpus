Such plans are referred to collectively herein as the " _Benefit Plans_." True and complete copies of (A) each Benefit Plan and (B) with respect to each Benefit Plan, (1) the most recent Summary Plan Description, if required under ERISA; (2) if the Benefit Plan is funded pursuant to a trust or any third party funding vehicle, the trust or other funding agreement and the most recent financial statements with respect thereto; and (3) the most recent determination letter received from the IRS if the Benefit Plan is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code have been made available to Purchaser. 

    

 (ii) Section 3.12(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule identifies each Benefit Plan that is sponsored, maintained or entered into solely by either the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Benefit Plan_ "), on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the other hand (each, a " _Seller Benefit Plan_ "). 

   

 (iii) No Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV or described in Section 3(37) of ERISA or is a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of 

   ##### 

  

    

ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer Plan_ "), and neither Seller nor any of its

contributed to, or has or had within the past six (6) years any liability or
obligation in respect of, any plan subject to Title IV, described in Section

 (b) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (A) has been maintained, operated and administered in material compliance with its terms and applicable Laws and (B) has received or has timely applied for a favorable determination letter from the IRS, and there are no circumstances currently pending that could reasonably be expected to result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter. 

   

 (c) All Benefit Plans are in material compliance with ERISA, the Code (to the extent such Benefit Plans are subject to ERISA and/or the Code) and other applicable Law. The Company and its Subsidiaries have satisfied all of their respective material obligations with respect to the Benefit Plans. Each Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code (a " _Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") has been operated in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the Code since January 1, 2005, based upon a good faith, reasonable interpretation of Section 409A of the Code and the final Treasury Regulation issued thereunder and all subsequent Internal Revenue Service Notices and other interim guidance on Section 409A of the Code. Each Company Benefit Plan which is subject to ERISA and which is intended to be a "top-hat" plan for purposes of ERISA is "unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees," as such phrase is used in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA.

Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to permit each Company Employee who has received an eligible rollover distribution from the Seller Retirement Plan, if any, to roll such eligible rollover distribution, including any associated loans to the extent such loan is not in default status as of the date of transfer, into the Purchaser 401(k) Plan. Parent shall take all action necessary to ensure that all employer contributions with respect to the portion of the plan year elapsed through the Benefits Transfer Date have been credited to the Seller Retirement Plan accounts of the Company Employees.

of time to review and comment on the communication (but, for
clarity, Purchaser shall not have approval rights over such communication).

 _ARTICLE VI_ 
  _TAX MATTERS_  

   

 Section 6.1 _Tax Indemnities_. (a) Seller and Parent shall jointly and severally be responsible for and indemnify and hold Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless from and against (i) Excluded Taxes and (ii) all cost and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses attributable to any item in clause (i); _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller and Parent shall not be liable for, and shall not be required to indemnify or hold Purchaser or any of its Affiliates harmless from or against, (A) any Taxes to the extent such Taxes have been taken into account in calculating the Applicable Amount and are reflected on the Applicable Amount Schedule under the heading "Deferred Tax Liabilities" as of the Closing Date or (B) any Taxes that arise from or in connection with any transactions involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date after the Closing that are not in the Company Ordinary Course of Business and not contemplated by this Agreement. 

    

 (b) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall be: 

   

 (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or measured by reference to income, gain or receipts or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than conveyances pursuant to this Agreement, as provided in Section 6.5), the Tax that would be due with respect to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period if such period ended on and included the Closing Date. Each Subsidiary of the Company that is treated as a partnership or "flow-through" entity for Tax purposes shall be treated as if its taxable year ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date and Taxes attributable to the income and gain of each such entity through the close of business on the Closing Date shall be considered to be attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period; and 

   

 (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or otherwise measured by the level of any item (other than items described in clause (i) of this Section 6.1(b)), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period. 

 

Any credit or refund resulting from an overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle
Period shall be prorated based upon the method employed in this Section
6.1(b), taking into account the type of Tax to which such credit or refund
relates. 

    

 (c) Payment by Seller or Parent of any amount due under this Section 6.1 shall be made within fifteen (15) Business Days following written notice by Purchaser that payment of related Taxes to the appropriate Governmental Authority is due; _provided_ that each of Seller and Parent shall not be required to make any payment earlier than five (5) Business Days before the related Taxes are due to the appropriate Governmental 

   ##### 

  

    

Authority. In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance with the
provisions of Section 6.2, payment of the Tax to the appropriate Governmental
Authority shall be considered to be due no earlier than the date a final
determination to such effect is made by the appropriate Governmental
Authority. 

   

 (d) Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns harmless from and against any Taxes that arise from or incurred in connection with, arising out of or resulting from (x) any breach by Purchaser and its Affiliates of Section 6.6, and (y) any transactions involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date after the Closing that are not in the Company Ordinary Course of Business and not contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 Section 6.2 _Tax Contests_. (a) After the Closing, Purchaser shall notify Seller in writing within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of any written notice of any proposed assessment or commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding and of any Tax demand or claim on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates that, if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time, could reasonably be expected to serve as grounds for indemnification by Seller or Parent under Section 6.1. Such notice shall contain factual information describing the asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other document received from any Governmental Authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability. A failure by Purchaser to give such notice shall not affect Purchasers right to indemnification under this Article VI, except to the extent that Sellers or Parents right to contest such Tax liability is materially prejudiced thereby. 

    

 (b) In the case of (i) a Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding (a " _Contest_ ") that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, to the extent Seller or Parent could reasonably be expected to have an indemnification obligation pursuant to this Article VI (a " _Seller Pre-Closing Contest_ "), and (ii) any Contest relating to any Straddle Period if Seller or Parent is reasonably expected to bear a greater Tax liability, including liabilities arising under this Article VI, than Purchaser in connection therewith (a " _Seller Straddle Period_ _Contest_ ," and, together with a Seller Pre-Closing Contest, a " _Seller Contest_ "), Parent shall have the sole right, at Parents expense, to control the conduct of any such Seller Contest. To the extent Parent elects to direct a Seller Pre-Closing Contest, Parent shall, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the notice of asserted Tax liability, notify Purchaser of its intent to do so, and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate in each phase of such Seller Pre-Closing Contest; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that (A) Parent shall consult with Purchaser in good faith before taking any significant action in connection with such Seller Pre-Closing Contest if such Seller Pre-Closing Contest could reasonably be expected to have a materially adverse effect on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries), and (B) Parent shall not compromise, settle or abandon any such Seller Pre-Closing Contest if such action could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) without obtaining Purchasers prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). To the extent Parent elects to direct a Seller Straddle Period Contest, Parent shall within 

   ##### 

  

    

fifteen (15) days of receipt of the notice of an asserted Tax liability
notify Purchaser of its intent to do so, and Purchaser shall reasonably
cooperate and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
reasonably cooperate in each phase of such Seller Straddle Period Contest;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that (A) Parent shall keep Purchaser informed on a
prompt basis regarding the progress and substantive aspects of any such
Seller Straddle Period Contest, including providing Purchaser with all
written materials relating to such Tax proceeding submitted to and received
from any Governmental Authority, (B) Purchaser shall be entitled to
participate in any such Seller Straddle Period Contest at its expense,
including having an opportunity to comment on any written materials prepared
in connection with any Seller Straddle Period Contest and attending any
conferences relating to such Contest, and (C) neither Parent nor Seller shall
compromise, settle or abandon any Seller Straddle Period Contest without
obtaining Purchasers prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) if such action could
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries). If Parent elects not to direct a Seller Contest, Purchaser or
its Affiliates may assume control of such Contest at Purchasers expense. In
such event, (A) Purchaser shall keep Seller informed on a prompt basis
regarding the progress and substantive aspects of any Contest, including
providing Seller with all written materials relating to such Tax
proceeding submitted to and received from any Governmental Authority, (B)
Seller shall be entitled to participate in any Contest at its expense,
including having an opportunity to comment on any written materials prepared
in connection with any Contest and attending any conferences relating to any
Contest, and (C) Purchaser shall not compromise, settle or abandon
any Contest without obtaining Sellers prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) if such action could
reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on Seller or any of its
Affiliates. In the case of any other Contest that relates to a Straddle
Period, Purchaser shall have the right to control such Contest subject to
Sellers rights described in the immediately preceding sentence of
this Section 6.2(b). 

  

 Section 6.3 _Preparation of Tax Returns_. (a) Parent shall prepare and file, on a basis consistent with past practice, all Tax Returns that relate to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and that are required to be filed with respect to any taxable period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a Pre-Closing Tax Period. With respect to any such Pre-Closing Tax Period, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, timely furnish, in a manner consistent with past practice, such information as is reasonably requested by Parent in order for Parent to prepare its consolidated federal Tax Returns and any other Tax Returns required to be prepared by Parent pursuant to this Section 6.3(a); _provided_ that if the Closing occurs on or before December 31, 2008, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, furnish such information to Parent no later than July 1, 2008. Any Tax Return that relates to or includes a Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prepared by Parent and required to be filed by the Company after the Closing shall be furnished by Parent to Purchaser or the applicable Subsidiary, as the case may be, for signature at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return (taking into account extensions);  _provided_ that signing a Tax Return pursuant to this subsection shall not be considered an acknowledgment that such Tax Return complies with the requirements of this Agreement. 

    ##### 

  

      

 (b) Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, in a timely manner, all Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable period that is a Straddle Period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Purchaser shall furnish such Tax Returns described in the immediately preceding sentence to Parent for its review and comment within a reasonable time prior to the due date of such Tax Return and shall consider in good faith any changes reasonably requested thereto by Parent; _provided_ that if the Closing occurs on or before December 31, 2008, Purchaser shall furnish such Tax Returns to Parent for review and comment no later than July 15, 2009. With respect to any Tax Returns for any Straddle Period of the Company or any Subsidiary, (i) to the extent permitted pursuant to applicable Tax Law, Parent may, and Purchaser or its Affiliates shall, at Parents direction, cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, take all steps as may be reasonably necessary, including the filing of elections or Tax Returns with any applicable Governmental Authority, to cause such period to end on the Closing Date, or (ii) if the foregoing clause (i) of this Section 6.3(b) is inapplicable, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall report the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries in a combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return required to be filed by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent only for that portion of such taxable period that ends on the Closing Date, notwithstanding that such taxable period does not end on the Closing Date. 

  

 Section 6.4 _Tax Cooperation; Refunds and Credits_. (a) Parent and Purchaser shall provide each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, with such cooperation and information as either of them may reasonably request of the other (and Purchaser shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide such cooperation and information) in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, making any Tax election, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes, or participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Governmental Authorities. Parent and Purchaser shall make themselves (and their respective employees) reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide explanations of any documents or information provided under this Section 6.4. Any information obtained under this Section 6.4 shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Purchaser shall not have any access to any books and records, Tax Returns or other information of Parent or its Affiliates that do not relate directly to the Company and its Subsidiaries. 

    

 (b) At Parents request, Purchaser shall cause the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries to make and/or join with Parent (or any of its Affiliates) in making any election relating solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period if the making of such election would not have any adverse impact on the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries for any Post-Closing Tax Period or Post-Closing Straddle Period or on Purchaser. 

   

 (c) Except as otherwise provided in the following sentence, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent any refunds of income Taxes (including interest thereon) with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period received by or credited to Purchaser, 

   ##### 

  

    

the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt of such refund,
except to the extent such refund was taken into account in determining the
Applicable Amount. At Parents reasonable request, Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall cooperate, at Parents expense, with Parent in obtaining such
refunds, including through the filing of amended Tax Returns or refund claims
as prepared by Parent;  _provided_ that such cooperation would not have any
material adverse effect on Purchaser. Purchaser shall permit and enable
Parent to control the prosecution of any such refund claim. Any refunds of
Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period
beginning after the Closing Date shall be for the account of Purchaser. Any
refunds of Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Straddle
Period shall be equitably apportioned between Parent and Purchaser in
accordance with the principles set forth in Section 6.1(b), except to
the extent such refund was taken into account in determining the Applicable
Amount. Each party shall forward, and shall cause its Affiliates to forward,
to the party entitled pursuant to this subsection to a refund of Taxes, the
amount of such refund within ten (10) days after such refund is received or
applied against another Tax liability, in each case, net of any costs to the
party receiving such refund. 

  

 Section 6.5 _Transfer Taxes_. All Tax Returns with respect to all federal, state, local or foreign taxes, sales, use, value added, transfer (including real property transfer or gains), stamp, stock transfer and similar Taxes together with any interest, additions or penalties with respect thereto and any interest in respect of such additions or penalties (but excluding any income or franchise Taxes) (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") imposed with respect to the purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be timely filed by the party responsible for such filing under applicable Law, and all such Transfer Taxes (and all out-of-pocket costs for preparation of such Tax Returns) shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller. Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate to reduce or eliminate any Transfer Taxes to the extent permitted by applicable Law. If Seller or Purchaser pays a Transfer Tax at the Closing or pursuant to a post-Closing assessment by a Governmental Authority, the other party will reimburse the paying party for fifty percent (50%) of the amount of such Transfer Tax within fifteen (15) days of the paying partys written demand therefor. 

   

 Section 6.6 _Post-Closing Actions Affecting Tax Liabilities for Pre-Closing and Straddle Periods_. (a) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not (and shall not cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to), without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), amend, re-file, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election relating in whole or in substantial part to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was previously filed with any Governmental Authority with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period, if doing so could reasonably be expected to result in a material indemnification obligation of Seller or Parent for Taxes pursuant to this Agreement. 

    

 (b) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall waive any statute of limitations or agree to any extensions thereof in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Pre-Closing Straddle Period without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 6.7 _Other Tax Matters_. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) the covenants and agreements of Parent, Seller and Purchaser contained in this Article VI shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until ninety (90) days after the expiration of the relevant statutes of limitation, and (ii) indemnification for any and all Tax matters, and the procedures with respect thereto, shall be governed exclusively by this Article VI and shall not be governed by Article IX; _provided_ , _however_ , that indemnification for Tax matters relating to any breaches of covenants otherwise contained in this Agreement (but outside this Article VI) shall be governed by Article IX. 

    

 (b) Any Tax sharing agreement or arrangement between Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be terminated, and all payments thereunder shall be settled, immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ that for the avoidance of doubt, the leases set forth in Section 3.14(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule that provide tangentially for an allocation or apportionment of Tax liabilities generated by or related to such lease shall not constitute any Tax allocation or Tax sharing agreements. 

   

 (c) The parties hereto agree to treat any indemnity payments pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the purchase price of the Shares, except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a Final Tax Determination. 

   

 (d) Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to (i) either (x) retain all Company Books and Records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until ninety (90) days after the expiration of the statute of limitation of the respective taxable periods, including extensions thereof, or (y) send such Company Books and Records described in (x) above to Parent, and (ii) abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority and give Parent reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such Company Books and Records.

been given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party on or prior to
the date on which the representation or warranty on which such claim or
Action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 9.1, irrespective
of whether the subject matter of such claim or Action shall have occurred
before or after such date. 

    

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement: 

   

 (i) an Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a) (other than with respect to a breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.5, 3.6 and 3.20), unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from the Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 9.2(a), as applicable, equals or exceeds $4,725,000, after which the Indemnifying Party shall be liable only for the amount of those Losses indemnifiable pursuant to Section 9.2(a), as applicable, in excess of $4,725,000;

 (b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice of any Action, audit, claim, demand or assessment against it that may give rise to a claim for Losses under this Article IX (each, a " _Third Party Claim_ "), within thirty (30) days of the receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party notice of such Third Party Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article IX except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to assume and control the defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice, if it promptly (at least ten (10) days before a response to such Third Party Claim is due) gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party, and if it so elects, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, but the Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume and control the defense of a Third Party Claim brought by or involving a Governmental Authority or Self-Regulatory Organization ( _provided_ that (i) the Indemnified Party shall, to the extent practicable, consult with the Indemnifying Party with respect to such defense of a Third Party Claim which is indemnifiable hereunder brought by or involving a Governmental Authority or Self-Regulatory Organization, (ii) the Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise or enter into any judgment relating to, or pay or permit to pay, any such Third Party Claim, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, and (iii) if the Indemnifying Party shall have admitted that it has a duty to fully indemnify any Indemnified Party with respect to a Third Party Claim pursuant to this Article IX and such Indemnifying Party has requested the Indemnified Party take over the defense and such Indemnified Party does elect to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall use diligent and good faith efforts in its defense of such Third Party Claim. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, such Third Party Claim include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there are or are reasonably likely to be legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or that there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest, in either case that would make it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be 

   ##### 

  

    

entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_
that the Indemnified Party shall use diligent and good faith efforts in such
defense. 

   

 (d) The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense and settlement of any Third Party Claim which is indemnifiable hereunder and make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. 

   

 (e) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control over the defense of any Third Party Claim which is indemnifiable hereunder as provided in Section 9.5(b), then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend such Third Party Claim, and the portion of any such Third Party Claim as to which the defense by the Indemnified Party is unsuccessful (and the reasonable costs and expenses pertaining to such defense) shall be a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder; _provided_ that if the Indemnifying Party shall have admitted that it has a duty to fully indemnify any Indemnified Party with respect to a Third Party Claim pursuant to this Article IX and such Indemnifying Party has requested the Indemnified Party take over the defense and such Indemnified Party does elect to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall use diligent and good faith efforts in its defense of such Third Party Claim and not settle or compromise such Third Party Claim without obtaining the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of such Third Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party consents in writing to such payment or unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party has been entered against the Indemnified Party for such Third Party Claim. 

   

 (f) The Indemnifying Party shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim of which it has assumed control as provided in Section 9.5(b), without the consent of any Indemnified Party; _provided_  that the Indemnifying Party shall (i) pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement or judgment, (ii) not encumber any of the assets of any Indemnified Party or agree to any restriction or condition that would apply to or materially adversely affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct of any Indemnified Partys businesses, (iii) obtain, as a condition of any settlement or judgment or other resolution, a complete release of any Indemnified Party potentially affected by such Third Party Claim, and (iv) ensure that such settlement or judgment does not include any admission of wrongdoing or misconduct. 

  

 Section 9.6 _Mitigation; Adjustments_. (a) Each Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to mitigate any Losses under this Article IX. 

    

 (b) In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under any insurance policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person (other than any Affiliate of such recipient), net of any actual costs, expenses or premiums incurred in connection with securing or obtaining such proceeds, (including the amount of such 

   ##### 

  

    

proceeds received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates after
payment has been made by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Article IX) shall be deducted, and to the extent of the
amount of any such proceeds that is received by the Indemnified Party or any
of its Affiliates after payment has been made by the Indemnifying Party to
the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article IX and has not been deducted
from the calculation of the Losses, such amount shall be paid by the
Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party as promptly as practicable. No
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to seek recovery against an Indemnified
Party, its Affiliates or its Representatives pursuant to any theory of
subrogation, contribution or otherwise of any Losses payable to such
an Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to seek recovery against an Indemnified Party, its
Affiliates or its Representatives in the event that the Indemnified Party,
its Affiliates or its Representatives fail to deduct the proceeds in the
calculation of the amount of any Loss or fail to pay to the Indemnifying
Party the amount of such proceeds that is received after payment has been
made by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article IX. 

   

 (c) In calculating the amount of any Loss, there shall be deducted an amount equal to any net federal income Tax benefit actually realized (including the utilization of a Tax loss or Tax credit carried forward) as a result of such Loss by the party claiming such Loss. The amount of a net federal income Tax benefit shall be the present value of the Tax benefit as of the date of any indemnification payment (using the interest rate calculation of Section 6621(a)(2) of the Code and assuming the Indemnified Party has sufficient Taxable income or other Tax attributes to permit the utilization of such Tax benefit at the earliest possible time) multiplied by (i) the combined effective federal corporate tax rates in effect at the time of the indemnity payment or (ii) in the case of a credit, one hundred percent (100%). 

   

 (d) If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third party (other than any Affiliate of such Indemnified Party) in respect of a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article IX, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus such amount received by the Indemnified Party in respect thereof, less (ii) the full amount of such Loss. 

  

 Section 9.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for (x) a partys right to specific performance under this Agreement, or (y) as otherwise provided in this Agreement, including for the avoidance of doubt Article VI and Article VIII, (a) this Article IX shall be the exclusive remedy of the parties hereto following the Closing for any Losses arising out of any misrepresentation or breach of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement of the parties contained in this Agreement, and (b) each of the parties hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action (other than with respect to willful misconduct or fraud) it may have against the other parties hereto, arising under or based upon any Law, Governmental Order or Self-Regulatory Organization Order, other than the right to seek indemnity pursuant to this Article IX.

 (b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in any federal court sitting in the State of Delaware;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if such federal court does not have jurisdiction over such Action, such Action shall be heard and determined exclusively in any state court sitting in the State of Delaware. Consistent with the preceding sentence, the parties hereto hereby (i) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in the State of Delaware for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (ii) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts. 

   

 (c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

 Section 10.6 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto recognize and agree that if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and irreparable harm or damage may be caused for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party hereto agrees that, in addition to any other available remedies, each other party shall be entitled to seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement or an injunction restraining any breach or violation or threatened breach or violation of the provisions of this Agreement without the necessity of posting a bond or other form of security.

 (b) If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible. 

  

 Section 10.9 _Disclosure Schedules_. There may be included in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Disclosure Schedules_ ") items and information, the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in Article III or Article IV or to one or more covenants contained in Article V. Inclusion of such items or information in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or agreement that any such item or information (or any non-disclosed item or information of comparable or greater significance) is "material" or is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect or to affect the interpretation of such term for purposes of this Agreement. Matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to the matters required by this Agreement to be disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be. The Disclosure Schedules set forth items of disclosure with specific reference to the particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the items or information in such Disclosure Schedule relates; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any information set forth in one section or subsection pertaining to representations, warranties and covenants of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, shall be deemed to apply to each other section or subsection thereof pertaining to representations, warranties and covenants to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face from a reading of such disclosure that it is relevant to such other sections or subsections of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be. 

   

 Section 10.10 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and

permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person other than Parent, Seller, Purchaser and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, any legal or equitable
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
