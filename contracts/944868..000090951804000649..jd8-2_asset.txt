to assign any Purchased Contract or Purchased Facility Lease or other related
approval, authorization or other right, which by its terms or by Law is (i)
nonassignable without the consent of a third party or a Governmental Body or
(ii) is cancelable by a third party in the event of an assignment
("Nonassignable Assets") unless and until such consent shall have been obtained
or the Bankruptcy Court shall have determined that such consent is not required
or such cancellation is not enforceable. Sellers shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Purchaser at its request in endeavoring to obtain such consents promptly.

                (b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, in the event
consents to the assignment thereof are required and cannot be obtained, such
Nonassignable Assets shall be held, as of and from the Closing Date, by Sellers
or the applicable Affiliate of Sellers in trust for Purchaser and the covenants
and obligations thereunder shall be performed by Purchaser in Sellers' or such
Affiliate's name and all benefits and obligations existing thereunder shall be

Nonassignable Assets and to effect collection of money or other consideration
that becomes due and payable under the Nonassignable Assets, and Sellers or the
applicable Affiliate of Sellers shall promptly pay over to Purchaser all money
or other consideration received by it in respect of all Nonassignable Assets. As
of and from the Closing Date, each Seller on behalf of itself and its Affiliates
authorizes Purchaser, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of
the Nonassignable Assets, at Purchaser's expense, to perform all the obligations
and receive all the benefits of Seller or its Affiliates under the Nonassignable
Assets and appoints Purchaser its attorney-in-fact to act in its name on its
behalf or in the name of the applicable Affiliate of Seller and on such
Affiliate's behalf with respect thereto. If and when a consent for the sale,

Asset is obtained, Sellers will promptly assign, transfer, convey, and deliver
such Nonassignable Asset to Purchaser, and Purchaser will assume the Liabilities
under such Nonassignable Asset assigned to Purchaser from and after the date of
assignment to Purchaser pursuant to such instruments as the parties deem
necessary to effect the transfer and assumption (which the parties will prepare,
execute, and deliver in good faith at the time of such transfer, all at no
additional cost to Purchaser).

                                  CONSIDERATION

         3.1 Consideration. The aggregate consideration for the Purchased Assets
shall be (i) an amount in cash equal to $937,719,121 (the "Purchase Price"), and

         3.2 Adjustments to the Purchase Price.

                (a) Adjustment for Pre-Commencement Date Judgment. The Purchase
Price payable hereunder shall be reduced by $62,719,121, which represents the
amount of Purchaser's pre-Commencement Date judgment against Sellers plus
post-judgment interest to the Commencement Date ("Seamless Judgment "), which
Seamless Judgment, together with all post-petition interest thereon, is being
released pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.

                (b) Adjustment Based on Patronage Amount. The Purchase Price
payable hereunder shall be increased by $10,841,802.59, subject to reduction, if

Amount"), plus an additional $6,000,000 in lieu of claims by Sellers and their
Affiliates relating to NRTC patronage accruing for any period after June 1, 2004
through the Closing Date, ("Additional Patronage Amount" together with the
Patronage Amount, the "Aggregate Patronage Amount"), which the parties hereto
agree represents a settlement of all amounts that may be owed to Sellers, at,
prior to, or after the date hereof with respect to undistributed patronage
capital (other than any additional amounts that might be distributed to Sellers
as contemplated by Section 4 of the Settlement Agreement).

                (c) Adjustment Based on Cooperation Agreement Obligations. The
Purchase Price payable hereunder shall be increased by the actual amounts owed
by Purchaser to Sellers pursuant to Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 of the Cooperation
Agreement (as adjusted pursuant to Sections 2.3(b) or 5.4 of the Cooperation
Agreement, if applicable) (the "Cooperation Agreement Obligations Amount").

                    (i) Purchaser shall deliver to PST, not less than two (2)
               Business Days prior to the Closing, a certificate of Purchaser,
               signed by an authorized officer of Purchaser (the "Purchaser's
               Estimated Customer Conversion Adjustment Certificate"), setting
               forth, if the Closing Date is before September 17, 2004,
               Purchaser's good faith pre-Closing estimate of the Customer

               Closing Date is on or after September 18, 2004, the actual
               Customer Conversion Reimbursement Amount as of September 15, 2004
               (in any such case, the "Preliminary Customer Conversion Amount").
               The Purchaser's Estimated Customer Conversion Adjustment
               Certificate shall set forth in reasonable detail, pursuant to a
               worksheet attached thereto, Purchaser's calculation of the
               Preliminary Customer Conversion Amount.

                    (ii) If the Closing Date is before September 16, 2004, then
               within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
               prepare and deliver to PST (A) a certificate, signed by an
               authorized officer of Purchaser (the "Purchaser's Closing
               Customer Conversion Adjustment Certificate"), which shall include
               a worksheet setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation of
               the Customer Conversion Reimbursement Amount as of the end of
               business on the Closing Date (the "Customer Conversion Amount").
               Purchaser shall (A) cooperate in good faith with PST in
               connection with PST's review of each of the Purchaser's Estimated
               Customer Conversion Adjustment Certificate and Purchaser's
               Closing Customer Conversion Adjustment Certificate and (B) grant
               PST and its representatives (including advisors and accountants)
               access at reasonable times and places to all books, records and
               employees of Purchaser reasonably requested by PST in connection
               with PST's review of such certificates. Sellers and the Purchaser
               shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any disputes raised by
               PST with respect to the Customer Conversion Reimbursement Amount
               ("Customer Conversion Disputed Items").

                    (iii) After attempting to resolve any Customer Conversion
               Disputed Items in accordance with Section 3.2(c)(ii) (whether or
               not a resolution is reached), Purchaser's Preliminary Customer
               Conversion Amount shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
               parties unless PST provide a written notice (a "Dispute Notice")
               to Purchaser no later than the thirtieth (30th) day after the
               Closing, if the Closing occurred after September 15, 2004, or not
               later than the thirtieth (30th) day after delivery of Purchaser's
               Closing Customer Conversion Adjustment Certificate if the Closing
               occurred before September 16, 2004, setting forth in reasonable
               detail any disagreement Purchaser has with the applicable
               certificate.

                    (iv) Purchaser and Sellers shall attempt to resolve the
               matters raised in a Dispute Notice in good faith. On or after the
               tenth (10th) Business Day after delivery of the Dispute Notice,
               either Purchaser or Sellers may provide written notice to the
               other that it elects to submit the Customer Conversion Disputed
               Items to BDO Seidman or another nationally recognized independent
               accounting firm chosen jointly by Purchaser and Sellers (the
               "Referee"), which for purposes of this Agreement will be deemed
               to be retained by Purchaser and Sellers. The Referee shall
               promptly, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
               the American Arbitration Association, review only those items and
               amounts specifically set forth and objected to in the Dispute
               Notice and resolve the dispute with respect to each such specific
               item. The fees and expenses of the Referee will be shared equally


                                       18
<PAGE>
               by Purchaser and Sellers. The decision of the Referee with
               respect to the items contained in the Dispute Notice will be
               final, conclusive and binding on the parties, and the Preliminary
               Customer Conversion Amount or the Customer Conversion Amount, as
               the case may be, as adjusted by the determinations of the Referee
               with respect to any items included in a Dispute Notice (the
               "Final Customer Conversion Reimbursement Amount"), shall be
               final, conclusive and binding on the parties. Each of the parties
               to this Agreement agrees to cooperate with the Referee and use
               its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Referee to
               resolve any dispute no later than thirty (30) Business Days after
               selection of the Referee.

                    (v) If the Final Customer Conversion Amount differs from the
               Preliminary Customer Conversion Amount, Sellers or Purchaser, as
               the case may be, shall make an appropriate reconciliation payment
               to the other within five (5) Business Days after the
               determination of such amount by wire transfer of immediately
               available funds. Any payment pursuant to this Section 3.2(c)(v)
               shall be an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

                (d) Adjustment Based on Net Services Obligations. Sellers shall
deliver to Purchaser, not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing,
a certificate of Sellers, signed by an authorized officer of PST, (the "Sellers'
Estimated Net Service Obligations Adjustment Certificate"), setting forth
Sellers' good-faith pre-Closing estimate of the Net Service Obligations as of
the Closing Date (the "Estimated Net Service Obligations"). The Sellers'
Estimated Net Service Obligations Adjustment Certificate shall set forth in
reasonable detail Sellers' calculation of the Estimated Net Service Obligations.
Prior to the Closing, Purchaser and Sellers may make any mutually agreed
adjustments to the Sellers' Estimated Net Service Obligations Adjustment
Certificate to update and/or correct the calculation of the Estimated Net
Services Obligations. The Purchase Price payable hereunder shall be reduced by
an amount equal to the Estimated Net Service Obligations ("Estimated Net Service
Obligations Adjustment Amount"). The calculation and resolution of Final Net
Service Obligations (as defined below) shall be determined in accordance with
Section 3.2(e)(iii) through (vii).

                (e) Adjustment Based on Free Cash Flow From Operations. It is
the intention of the parties that the Closing Date occur on or before September
15, 2004. If the Closing Date occurs after September 15, 2004, the parties will
follow the procedures set forth in this Section 3.2(e) regarding Free Cash Flow
From Operations and the Purchase Price will be adjusted accordingly to allow
Purchaser to receive the economic benefit of any Free Cash Flow From Operations
commencing on September 16, 2004.

                    (i) If the Closing Date is after September 15, 2004, Sellers
               shall deliver to Purchaser, two (2) Business Days prior to the
               Closing Date, a certificate of Sellers, signed by an authorized
               officer of PST (the "Sellers' Estimated Cash Flow Adjustment
               Certificate"), setting forth Sellers' good faith estimate of the
               Free Cash Flow From Operations ("Estimated Cash Flow"). The

<PAGE>
               Sellers' Estimated Cash Flow Adjustment Certificate shall set
               forth in reasonable detail Sellers' calculation of the Estimated
               Cash Flow.

                    (ii) The Purchase Price payable hereunder will be reduced by
               the Estimated Cash Flow (the "Estimated Cash Flow Adjustment
               Amount").

                    (iii) Each Seller shall (A) cooperate in good faith with
               Purchaser in connection with Purchaser's review of each of the
               Sellers' Estimated Cash Flow Adjustment Certificate and the
               Sellers' Estimated Net Service Obligations Adjustment Certificate
               and (B) grant Purchaser and its representatives (including its
               advisors and accountants) access at reasonable times and places
               to all books, records and employees of Sellers, reasonably
               requested by Purchaser in connection with Purchaser's review of
               such certificates.

                    (iv) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Sellers
               shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser (A) a certificate, signed
               by an authorized officer of PST (only if the Closing Date is
               after September 15, 2004) (the "Sellers' Closing Date Cash Flow
               Adjustment Certificate"), which shall include a worksheet setting
               forth a reasonably detailed calculation of the Free Cash Flow
               From Operations ("Closing Date Cash Flow") and (B) a certificate,
               signed by an authorized officer of PST (the "Sellers' Closing
               Date Net Service Obligations Adjustment Certificate"), which
               shall include a worksheet setting forth a reasonably detailed
               calculation of the Net Service Obligations as of the Closing Date
               ("Closing Date Net Service Obligations"). Sellers shall (A)
               cooperate in good faith with Purchaser, in connection with
               Purchaser's review of each of the Sellers' Closing Date Cash Flow
               Adjustment Certificate and the Sellers' Closing Date Net Service
               Obligations Adjustment Certificate and (B) grant Purchaser and
               its representatives (including its advisors and accountants)
               access at reasonable times and places to all books, records and
               employees of Sellers, reasonably requested by Purchaser in
               connection with Purchaser's review of such certificates. Sellers
               and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any
               disputes raised by Purchaser with respect to either Sellers'
               Closing Date Cash Flow or Sellers' Closing Date Net Service
               Obligations ("Disputed Items").

                    (v) After attempting to resolve any Disputed Items in
               accordance with Section 3.2(e)(iv) (whether or not a resolution
               is reached), the Closing Date Cash Flow and the Closing Date Net
               Service Obligations shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
               parties unless Purchaser provides a Dispute Notice to Sellers no
               later than the thirtieth (30th) day after delivery of the
               Sellers' Closing Date Cash Flow Adjustment Certificate or the
               Sellers' Closing Date Net Services Obligations Adjustment
               Certificate, as applicable, setting forth in reasonable detail
               any disagreement Purchaser has with the applicable certificate of
               Sellers.

                    (vi) Purchaser and Sellers or the Creditors' Committee, as
               applicable, shall attempt to resolve the matters raised in a
               Dispute Notice in good faith. On or after the tenth (10th)
               Business Day after delivery of the Dispute Notice, either
               Purchaser or Sellers may provide written notice to the other that


                                       20
<PAGE>
               it elects to submit the Disputed Items to the Referee. The
               Referee shall promptly, in accordance with the Commercial
               Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, review
               only those items and amounts specifically set forth and objected
               to in the Dispute Notice and resolve the dispute with respect to
               each such specific item and amount, and with respect to the
               Closing Date Net Service Obligations, based on the terms of the
               Member Agreements and the Seamless Agreement. The fees and
               expenses of the Referee will be shared equally by Purchaser and
               Sellers. The decision of the Referee with respect to the items
               contained in the Dispute Notice will be final, conclusive and
               binding on the parties, and (A) the Closing Date Cash Flow set
               forth in Sellers' Closing Date Cash Flow Adjustment Certificate,
               as adjusted by the determinations of the Referee with respect to
               any items included in a Dispute Notice (the "Final Cash Flow"),
               shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties, and (B)
               the Closing Date Net Service Obligations set forth in Sellers'
               Closing Date Net Service Obligations Adjustment Certificate, as
               adjusted by the determinations of the Referee with respect to any
               items included in a Dispute Notice (the "Final Net Service
               Obligations"), shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
               parties. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees to
               cooperate with the Referee and use its commercially reasonable
               efforts to cause the Referee to resolve any dispute no later than
               thirty (30) Business Days after selection of the Referee.

                    (vii) If (A) the Closing Cash Flow differs from the
               Estimated Cash Flow and/or (B) the Closing Date Net Service
               Obligations differs from the Estimated Net Services Obligations,
               as the case may be, Sellers or Purchaser, as the case may be,
               shall make an appropriate reconciliation payment to the other
               within five (5) Business Days after the determination of such
               amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Any
               payment pursuant to this Section 3.2(e)(vii) shall be an
               adjustment to the Purchase Price.

                (f) Adjustment Based on Closing Date. If the Closing Date occurs
on or before September 15, 2004, the Purchase Price payable hereunder shall be
increased by an amount equal to the product of (i) $600,000 and (ii) the number
of calendar days between the Closing Date and September 15, 2004 (excluding the
Closing Date, but including September 15, 2004), (the "Closing Date Adjustment
Amount").

                (g) Adjustment Based on Net Working Capital. Schedule 3.2(g)
attached hereto sets forth, as of June 30, 2004 for illustrative purposes, the
line items that will be included in the Sellers' Pre-Closing and Post-Closing
Net Working Capital Adjustment Certificates in a manner consistent with the
Agreed Principles.

                    (i) Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser, not less than two
               (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, a certificate of Sellers,
               signed by an authorized officer of PST (the "Sellers' Pre-Closing
               Net Working Capital Adjustment Certificate"), setting forth
               Sellers' good faith pre-Closing estimate of the Net Working
               Capital Amount (as defined below) of the Sellers as of the close
               of business on the Closing Date (in any such case, the
               "Preliminary Net Working Capital Amount"). The Sellers'


                                       21
<PAGE>
               Pre-Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment Certificate shall set
               forth in reasonable detail, pursuant to a worksheet attached
               thereto, Sellers' calculation of the Preliminary Net Working
               Capital Amount. The Preliminary Net Working Capital Amount shall
               fairly present the Net Working Capital Amount of the Sellers as
               of the close of business on the Closing Date, and shall be
               prepared in accordance with GAAP, subject to the Agreed
               Principles. The Purchase Price payable hereunder shall be reduced
               or increased by an amount equal to the Preliminary Net Working
               Capital Amount.

                "Net Working Capital Amount" means an amount calculated in
accordance with items set forth on Schedule 3.2(g).

                    (ii) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Sellers
               shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser (A) a certificate, signed
               by an authorized officer of PST (the "Sellers' Post Closing Net
               Working Capital Adjustment Certificate"), which shall include a
               worksheet setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation of the
               Net Working Capital Amount as of the end of business on the
               Closing Date (the "Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount"). The
               Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount shall fairly present the
               Net Working Capital Amount of the Sellers as of the end of
               business on the Closing Date, and shall be prepared in accordance
               with GAAP, subject to the Agreed Principles. Sellers shall (A)
               cooperate in good faith with Purchaser in connection with
               Purchaser's review of each of Sellers' Pre-Closing Net Working
               Capital Adjustment Certificate and Sellers' Post Closing Net
               Working Capital Adjustment Certificate and (B) grant Purchaser
               and its representatives (including advisors and accountants)
               access at reasonable times and places to all books, records and
               employees of Sellers reasonably requested by Purchaser in
               connection with Purchaser's review of such certificates. Sellers
               (or the Creditors' Committee, as applicable) and the Purchaser
               shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any disputes raised by
               Purchaser with respect to the Preliminary Net Working Capital
               Amount and/or the Closing Date Net Working Capital Amount
               ("Working Capital Disputed Items").

                    (iii) After attempting to resolve any Working Capital
               Disputed Items in accordance with Section 3.2(g)(ii) (whether or
               not a resolution is reached), Sellers' Closing Date Net Working
               Capital Amount shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
               parties unless Purchaser provides a Dispute Notice to PST and the
               Creditors' Committee not later than the thirtieth (30th) day
               after delivery of Sellers' Post Closing Net Working Capital
               Adjustment Certificate, setting forth in reasonable detail any
               disagreement Purchaser has with the applicable certificate.

                    (iv) Purchaser and Sellers shall attempt to resolve the
               matters raised in a Dispute Notice in good faith. On or after the
               tenth (10th) Business Day after delivery of the Dispute Notice,
               either Purchaser or Sellers may provide written notice to the
               other that it elects to submit the Working Capital Disputed Items
               the Referee. The Referee shall promptly, in accordance with the
               Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
               Association, review only those items and amounts specifically set


                                       22
<PAGE>
               forth and objected to in the Dispute Notice and resolve the
               dispute with respect to each such specific item. The fees and
               expenses of the Referee will be shared equally by Purchaser and
               Sellers. The decision of the Referee with respect to the items
               contained in the Dispute Notice will be final, conclusive and
               binding on the parties, and the Closing Date Net Working Capital
               Amount as adjusted by the determinations of the Referee with
               respect to any items included in a Dispute Notice (the "Final Net
               Working Capital Amount"), shall be final, conclusive and binding
               on the parties. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees to
               cooperate with the Referee and use its commercially reasonable
               efforts to cause the Referee to resolve any dispute no later than
               thirty (30) Business Days after selection of the Referee.

                    (v) If the Final Net Working Capital Amount differs from the
               Preliminary Net Working Capital Amount, Sellers or Purchaser, as
               the case may be, shall make an appropriate reconciliation payment
               to the other within five (5) Business Days after the
               determination of such amount by wire transfer of immediately
               available funds. Any payment pursuant to this Section 3.2(g)(v)
               shall be an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

                (h) Adjustment Based on NRTC Letters of Credit. If Purchaser
does not deliver the NRTC Letters of Credit pursuant to Section 4.3(e), the Net
Service Obligations will be reduced by the face amount of such NRTC Letters of
Credit not so delivered; provided, however, that if such failure occurs as a
result of the NRTC Letters of Credit having been drawn (A) as provided in
Section 2.c of the Settlement Agreement, and the proceeds thereof held in
accordance with the terms of Section 2.c of the Settlement Agreement, such
section of the Settlement Agreement will apply; and (B) other than as set forth
in Section 2.c of the Settlement Agreement, the Net Service Obligations shall be
reduced by the amount of all draws under such NRTC Letters of Credit.

                (i) Any amounts due from Sellers to Purchaser as a result of any
post-Closing adjustments to the Purchase Price provided for in this Section 3.2
shall constitute allowed expenses of administration under sections 503(b) and
507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code and shall be promptly paid as and when provided
for in this Agreement.

         3.3 Payment of Purchase Price. On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay
the Purchase Price, plus or minus, as applicable, (a) the amount of the Seamless
Judgment, (b) the Aggregate Patronage Amount, (c) the Cooperation Agreement
Obligations Amount, (d) the Estimated Net Services Obligations Amount, (e) the
Estimated Cash Flow Adjustment Amount, (f) the Closing Date Adjustment Amount,
(g) the Preliminary Net Working Capital Amount and (h) the NRTC Patronage
Certificate Face Amount (such net amount referred to herein as the "Net Purchase
Price"), to Sellers in an amount for each Seller as designated by Sellers, which
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds into the Sellers'
DBS concentration account as specified on Schedule 3.3.


                                       23

         3.4 Letter of Credit.

                (a) On the second Business Day after Sellers notify Purchaser
that the Approval Motion is ready to be filed, Purchaser shall (i) cause Bank of
America to issue the Letter of Credit and Purchaser shall deliver such Letter of
Credit to PST to be held for the account of Sellers and (ii) take possession of
the NRTC Letters of Credit, and concurrently therewith, Sellers and the
Creditors' Committee will file the Approval Motion.

                (b) At the Closing, at Purchaser's election (which election
shall be made by Purchaser and communicated to Sellers at least two Business
Days prior to the Closing), PST shall either (i) surrender the Letter of Credit
to Purchaser without drawing thereon against payment of the Net Purchase Price
by Purchaser in immediately available funds or (ii) draw upon the Letter of
Credit to the extent necessary to satisfy the payment of the Net Purchase Price
hereunder (and the letter of credit shall terminate following such draw).

                (c) If all conditions set forth in Sections 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3,
other than those in Section 10.3(d), have been or are capable of being
immediately satisfied (or have been waived by the party entitled to waive that
condition), and the Bankruptcy Court shall have determined in an Order that the
failure of the condition in Section 10.3(d) is solely a result of Purchaser's
breach of its agreements and obligations in Section 8.3, Sellers can elect to
draw upon the Letter of Credit an amount equal to the Net Purchase Price. If
Sellers make such election, (i) Sellers must sell, transfer and assign to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall acquire and assume from Sellers, those Purchased
Assets and Assumed Liabilities that are allowed to be transferred pursuant to
the HSR Act, (ii) the Effective Date of the Settlement Agreement shall be deemed
to have occurred and the releases in favor of Sellers and their Affiliates,
Purchaser and its Affiliates and NRTC shall be granted and fully operative as
more fully set forth in the Settlement Agreement, (iii) Sellers shall deliver
the items required by Section 4.2 and Purchaser shall deliver the items required
by Section 4.3, including the NRTC Letters of Credit, and (iv) Purchaser and
Sellers each agree to comply with their obligations under Section 8.3 and shall
transfer the remaining Purchased Assets and assume the Assumed Liabilities as
soon as legally permissible, effective as of the Closing Date. Nothing in this
Section 3.4(c) shall relieve any party of its obligations under the Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereby
agree that if the Sellers elect to draw upon the Letter of Credit pursuant to
this Section 3.4(c), the amount of such draw shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Sellers against Purchaser for Purchaser's breach of Section 8.3. If
despite the parties using commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the
obligations under Section 8.3, Purchaser never receives all of the Purchased
Assets under this Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges that in such event Purchaser
is not entitled to refund of the Net Purchase Price paid under this Section
3.4(c). Sellers' retention of the Net Purchase Price shall be in consideration
of (i) the Purchased Assets, if any, transferred to Sellers, (ii) Sellers'
covenants to transfer the Purchased Assets to Purchaser when legally
permissible, (iii) the covenants of Sellers in the Settlement Agreement, and
(iv) liquidated damages for Purchaser's breach of Section 8.3 hereof (Sellers
and Purchaser acknowledge that it would be impossible to calculate, and such
liquidated damages constitute a reasonable estimate of, such damages).


                                       24
<PAGE>
                (d) If all the conditions set forth in Sections 10.1, 10.2 and
10.3 have been or are capable of being immediately satisfied (or have been
waived by the party entitled to waive that condition) as determined by an Order
of the Bankruptcy Court, and Purchaser fails to deliver the Net Purchase Price,
Sellers can elect to draw upon the Letter of Credit an amount equal to the Net
Purchase Price. If Sellers make such election, (i) Sellers must sell, transfer
and assign to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall acquire and assume from Sellers,
the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities, (ii) the Effective Date of the
Settlement Agreement shall be deemed to have occurred and the releases in favor
of Sellers and their Affiliates, Purchaser and its Affiliates and NRTC shall be
granted and fully operative as more fully set forth in the Settlement Agreement
and (iii) Sellers shall deliver the items required by Section 4.2 and Purchaser
shall deliver the items required by Section 4.3; provided, however, that if
Purchaser fails or refuses to deliver any such items, then the Closing shall
nonetheless occur.

                (e) (i) If the Closing has not taken place and Purchaser has not
extended the term of the Letter of Credit on or prior to the Business Day
immediately preceding the day on which the Letter of Credit is scheduled to
expire, PST can elect to draw upon the Letter of Credit an amount equal to the
full amount thereof on the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which
the Letter of Credit is scheduled to expire or on the expiration date of the
Letter of Credit (an "Expiration Draw Date") pursuant to clause (ii) below;
provided, however, that Purchaser can elect to replace the Letter of Credit with
a substitute letter of credit, identical in all respects other than the
Expiration Draw Date to the Letter of Credit, in an amount equal to $875,000,000
with a future expiration date, and if such substitute letter of credit is issued
and delivered to PST in exchange for the expiring Letter of Credit to be held
for the account of Sellers, prior to the Business Day preceding the Expiration
Draw Date, Sellers will have no further rights under this Section 3.4(e) with
respect to such expiring Letter of Credit.

           (ii) If PST elects to draw upon the Letter of Credit in
      accordance with Section 3.4(e)(i), Sellers must arrange for such
      funds (the "Trust Funds") to be held in trust for the benefit of
      Purchaser until the earliest of (A) the Closing Date (at such
      time the Net Purchase Price will be paid to Sellers out of such
      Trust Funds and any remaining amounts will be delivered to
      Purchaser), (B) Purchaser provides Sellers with a substitute
      letter of credit to be issued and delivered to PST to be held for
      the account of Sellers in an amount equal to the Trust Funds
      (less any accrued interest) (at such time, Sellers will promptly
      arrange for the Trust Funds (and any accrued interest accrued
      thereon) to be released to Purchaser), and (C) the termination of
      this Agreement (at such time the Trust Funds (and any accrued
      interest thereon) will be released to Purchaser, unless Sellers
      shall be entitled to the Net Purchase Price pursuant to Sections
      3.4(c) or 3.4(d).)

       (f) Purchaser agrees to provide advance written notice to
Sellers and the Creditors' Committee if it intends to file a motion with the
Bankruptcy Court to terminate the Letter of Credit.

         4.4 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated prior to
the Closing as follows:

                (a) by Purchaser or Sellers, if for any reason the Closing shall
not have occurred by the close of business on November 1, 2004 (the "Termination
Date"); provided, however, that if the Closing shall not have occurred on or
before November 1, 2004 due to a breach of this Agreement by Purchaser or
Sellers, Purchaser or Sellers, as the case may be, may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.4(a); and provided further, that if all of
the conditions to Closing set forth in Article X (other than Section 10.3(d))
have been satisfied or waived on or prior to November 1, 2004, and the FTC or
Antitrust Division has issued a second request for additional information
relating to the transactions or has challenged the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement in a Legal Proceeding as a result of which a temporary restraining
order or injunction has been issued, the Termination Date shall be extended
until three (3) Business Days after such time as the waiting period for such
second request has expired or been terminated or the District Court (or other
applicable Governmental Authority) shall have terminated or denied such
temporary restraining order or entered such injunction.

8.2(d)) which would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Sections
10.1 or 10.3, except that, if such breach is reasonably capable of being cured
prior to November 1, 2004, and such Seller uses its reasonable best efforts to
cure such breach, then for so long as the breach is curable and Seller continues
to use its reasonable best efforts to cure the breach, such termination shall
not become effective unless such breach is not cured prior to November 1, 2004;

                (d) by Sellers, upon written notice from PST to Purchaser of a

                (e) by Sellers, if the Letter of Credit has not been delivered
pursuant to Section 3.4 on or before August 7, 2004, unless the failure to issue

finalize the Approval Motion or notify Purchaser that the Approval Motion was
ready to be filed pursuant to Section 3.4;

                (f) by Sellers or Purchaser, if there shall be in effect a Final

definitive agreement with respect to a Covered Transaction or (ii) the
Bankruptcy Court enters an order which approves a Covered Transaction. In either
such event Purchaser reserves the right to file an application, pursuant to

Agreement, the Settlement Agreement and the Cooperation Agreement as would
enable the Sellers and the Creditors' Committee to proceed with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Settlement Agreement and the Cooperation
Agreement;

                (h) by Purchaser, if Sellers withdraw or modify or amend in a
manner adverse in any material respect to Purchaser (without the prior written
consent of Purchaser) the Approval Motion, in such event, Purchaser reserves the

Approval Order on or before October 15, 2004, or after its entry such order

in a manner adverse to Purchaser without the prior written consent of Purchaser;

                (j) by Purchaser, if the Approval Motion is not filed on or

                (k) by Purchaser, if any Seller has failed to perform or
violates in any material respect any of its covenants and agreements set forth
in the first sentence of Section 8.2(d).

         4.5 Procedure Upon Termination. In the event of termination by
Purchaser or Sellers, or both, pursuant to Section 4.4, written notice thereof
shall forthwith be given to the other party, and this Agreement shall terminate,
and the purchase of the Purchased Assets and the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities hereunder shall be abandoned, without further action by Purchaser or
any Seller. If this Agreement is validly terminated as provided herein, each
party shall re-deliver to the party furnishing the same or destroy all
documents, work papers and other material of any other party relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or after the
execution hereof.

         4.6 Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with Section 4.4, then each of the parties shall be

set forth in Sections 3.4, 4.5, 4.6, 8.6, 12.1, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7,
12.8, 12.9, 12.10, 12.11, 12.12, 12.13, and 12.14 shall survive any such
termination and shall be enforceable hereunder and (ii) nothing herein shall
relieve any party from Liability for any breach of this Agreement. In the event
this Agreement shall be terminated and at such time any party is in breach of or
in default under any term or provision hereof, such termination shall be without
prejudice to, and shall not affect, any and all rights to damages that any other
party may have hereunder or otherwise under applicable Law.

creditors' rights and remedies generally and subject, as to enforceability, to
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
proceeding at law or in equity), except where the failure, individually or in
the aggregate, to be so in full force and effect, legal, valid and binding or
enforceable could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Except as set forth on Schedule 5.5, such Seller has not received any written
notice of any default or event that with notice or lapse of time or both would
constitute a default by such Seller under any Purchased Contract or Purchased
Facility Lease to which such Seller is a party, other than defaults that are
unenforceable due to the operation of applicable bankruptcy Law or the Approval
Order.

         5.6 Litigation. There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, threatened against a Seller, or to which such Seller is
otherwise a party, which, if adversely determined, could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect, and no Seller is subject to any Order that
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.7 Compliance with Laws. Each Seller is in compliance with all Laws of
any Governmental Body applicable to its operations or assets or the Business,
except where the failure to be in compliance could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Seller has not received any written notice
of or been charged with the violation of any Laws, except where such violation
could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.8 Accounts Receivable and Payable. All accounts and notes receivable
of Sellers and its subsidiaries have arisen from bona fide transactions in the
Ordinary Course of Business and are payable on ordinary trade terms in the
aggregate recorded amounts thereof, net of any applicable reserve for returns or
doubtful accounts reflected thereon, which reserves were calculated in
accordance with GAAP and the Agreed Principles.

         5.9 No Other Representations or Warranties; Schedules. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article V (as modified by the
Schedules), neither Sellers nor any other Person makes any other express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Sellers, the Purchased
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the transactions contemplated by this


                                       31
<PAGE>
Agreement, and each Seller disclaims any other representations or warranties.
The disclosure of any matter or item in any Schedule shall not be deemed to
constitute an acknowledgment that any such matter is required to be disclosed or
is material or that such matter could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted.

         6.2 Authorization of Agreement. Purchaser has full corporate power and

with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (such
other agreements, documents, instruments or certificates, the "Purchaser
Documents"), and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of this Agreement and each
Purchaser Document have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action
on behalf of Purchaser. This Agreement has been, and each Purchaser Document
will be, at or prior to the Closing, duly executed and delivered by Purchaser
and (assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties
hereto and thereto) this Agreement constitutes, and each Purchaser Document when
so executed and delivered will constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations
of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with their respective
terms.

         6.3 Conflicts; Consents of Third Parties.

                (a) None of the execution and delivery by Purchaser of this
Agreement and of the Purchaser Documents, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or the compliance by Purchaser with any of the
provisions hereof or thereof will conflict with or result in any violation or
default under or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration (whether after the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both)
of any obligation under (i) the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of
Purchaser, (ii) any Contract or Permit to which Purchaser is a party or by which
Purchaser or its properties or assets are bound, (iii) any Order applicable to
Purchaser or any of the properties or assets of Purchaser or (iv) any applicable
Law, except, in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), for such violations,
breaches, defaults, terminations, cancellations or accelerations as could not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.


                                       32
<PAGE>
                (b) No consent, waiver, approval, Order, Permit or authorization
of, or declaration or filing with, or notification to, any Person or
Governmental Body is required on the part of Purchaser in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Purchaser Documents or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except for (i)
compliance with the applicable requirements of the HSR Act and (ii) such other
consents, waivers, approvals, Orders, Permits, authorizations, declarations,
filings and notifications, the failure of which to be obtained or made could not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of
Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

         6.4 Financial Capability. Purchaser has access to sufficient funding to
deliver the Letter of Credit.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                            BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVAL

         7.1 Bankruptcy Court Filings. Purchaser agrees that, without Purchaser
being required to assume any Liability but at its own expense, Purchaser will,
following a request by Sellers in connection with the Approval Order, furnish
affidavits or other documents or information reasonably requested by Sellers for
filing with the Bankruptcy Court for the purposes, among others, of providing
adequate assurances of performance by Purchaser under any Purchased Contracts or
Purchased Facility Leases and for demonstrating that Purchaser is a "good faith"
purchaser under section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code. In the event that the
Approval Order is appealed, Sellers and Purchaser, each at their own expense,
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to defend such
appeal.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                    COVENANTS

         8.1 Access to Information. Subject to the Cooperation Agreement (for so
long as such agreement is in effect) and the Confidentiality Agreement, Sellers
agree that, prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall be entitled, through its
officers, employees and representatives (including its legal advisors and
accountants), to make such investigation of the properties, business and
operations of the Business and the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities
(provided that Purchaser shall have no access to the Subscriber Lists except as
provided for in Section 2.2(b) of the Cooperation Agreement) as it reasonably
requests to enable it to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Cooperation Agreement. Any such investigation and examination
shall be conducted during regular business hours upon reasonable advance notice
and under reasonable circumstances.

               Business, and (B) preserve the present relationships with
               customers and suppliers of the Business (it being understood that
               (x) without prejudice to the respective rights of Sellers or
               Purchaser, Purchaser and its Affiliates and other competitors of
               Sellers will be marketing DIRECTV Services to the Active
               Subscribers, and (y) the loss of Active Subscribers to Purchaser
               or any of its Affiliates or any other competitor of Sellers, the
               filing of one or more notices under the Worker Adjustment and
               Retraining Notification Act and the termination of Subscriber
               acquisition efforts by Sellers to the extent Sellers are not
               reimbursed for the costs thereof by Purchaser pursuant to the
               Cooperation Agreement or otherwise shall not be deemed to
               constitute breaches of this Section 8.2(a)(i));

                    (ii) Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
               to (i) file the Approval Motion with the Bankruptcy Court by July
               30, 2004 and (ii) have a hearing on approval of the Approval
               Order held no later than September 1, 2004.

                (b) Except (1) as set forth on Schedule 8.2, (2) as required by
applicable Law, (3) as expressly provided for in this Agreement or (4) with the
prior written consent of Purchaser, each Seller shall not:

                    (i) subject any of the Purchased Assets to any Lien, except
               for the Permitted Exceptions or liens granted pursuant to the
               Bankruptcy Court's final order authorizing the use of collateral
               and granting other relief, dated June 25, 2004;

                    (ii) acquire any material properties or assets that would be
               Purchased Assets or sell, assign, license, transfer, convey,
               lease or otherwise dispose of any of the Purchased Assets except
               in the Ordinary Course of Business;

                    (iii) terminate, release, assign any rights under or
               discharge any other party thereunder of any of their obligations
               under any Purchased Contract or Purchased Facility Lease or
               amend, modify or supplement the terms of any Purchased Contract
               or Purchased Facility Lease;

                    (iv) waive or release any material right of any Seller that
               constitutes a material portion of the Purchased Assets; provided,
               however, Sellers have no right to waive any rights to or disclose
               any portion of the Subscriber Lists; or

                    (v) agree to do anything prohibited by this Section 8.2.


                                       34
<PAGE>
                (c) Subject to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, after the
date hereof and prior to the Closing, Sellers shall notify Purchaser in writing
from time to time of any Contracts or leases entered into by Sellers relating to
the Business solely for the purpose of giving Purchaser the opportunity to
determine whether to add such Contracts or Leases to Schedule 2.1(g) or Schedule
2.1(e), respectively, pursuant to Section 2.6(b).

                (d) Sellers shall not, and shall not authorize any of their
respective Affiliates, advisors, agents, employees, representatives or others
acting on their behalf to, disclose, or grant access, to any competitor of
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, advisors, agents, employees, representatives
or others acting on its behalf to the Subscriber Lists or the list of Sellers'
installation and equipment servicing providers and retailers. Sellers shall not,
and shall not authorize any of the foregoing Persons to disclose any Subscriber
Information to any Person, unless (i) such Person enters into a Third Party
Confidentiality Agreement or (ii) Sellers are required to make such disclosure
by the Bankruptcy Court or applicable Law.

                (e) Prior to Closing, Sellers shall deliver any Patronage
Certificates in the possession of Sellers to NRTC so as to enable NRTC to affix
the legend contemplated by Section 4 of the Settlement Agreement to such
certificates.

                (f) Sellers will pay for any and all shipping costs related to
the delivery to Purchaser of the receivers and inventory included in calculating
the Final Net Working Capital Amount.

         8.3 Regulatory Approvals.

                (a) Purchaser and Sellers shall (i) make or cause to be made all
filings required of each of them or any of their respective subsidiaries or
Affiliates under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable after the date of
this Agreement (and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the date
hereof), (ii) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request under the
HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws for additional information, documents or other
materials received by each of them or any of their respective Affiliates from
the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC"), the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") or any other Governmental Body
in respect of such filings or such transactions and (iii) cooperate with each
other in connection with any such filing and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry of any of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or
other Governmental Body under any Antitrust Laws with respect to any such filing
or any such transaction. Each such party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any application or
other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each such party shall promptly


                                       35
<PAGE>
inform the other parties hereto of any oral communication with, and provide
copies of written communications with, any Governmental Body regarding any such
filings or any such transaction. No party hereto shall independently participate
in any formal meeting with any Governmental Body in respect of any such filings,
investigation, or other inquiry without giving the other parties hereto prior
notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Body,
the opportunity to attend and/or participate.

                (b) Purchaser and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of the
notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to such
transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement.
Purchaser and Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such
objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Body with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman
Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act,
as amended, and any other federal or state or foreign statutes, rules,
regulations, orders, decrees, administrative or judicial doctrines or other Laws
that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose
or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, the "Antitrust
Laws"). In connection therewith, if any Legal Proceeding is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as in violation of any Antitrust Law, Purchaser and Sellers shall
cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such
Legal Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by
pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal and all
available legislative action, unless, by mutual agreement, Purchaser and Sellers
decide that pursuing such Legal Proceeding is not in their respective best
interests. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Purchaser shall not
be required to divest itself of any business, product lines, subscribers or
assets in connection with seeking or obtaining approvals under any Law relating
to antitrust, competition or trade regulation.

         8.4 Further Assurances. (a) Sellers and Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take all actions necessary or appropriate
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) cause the
fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to their
respective obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. After the Closing, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) deliver promptly to Purchaser any mail or other communication received by
Sellers after the Closing pertaining to the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities, and any cash, checks or other instruments of payment in respect
thereof which constitute a Purchased Asset and (ii) refer all inquiries related
to the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities to Purchaser. After the
Closing, Purchaser shall be entitled to possession of all Documents, provided
Sellers shall continue to have rights to access and copy the Documents, for
internal use purposes only, at their sole expense, in connection with the
administration of the estate in the Chapter 11 Case.


                                       36
<PAGE>
                (b) If requested by Purchaser, effective on the Closing Date,
any lock box or other arrangements for receipt of payments in respect of the
Purchased Assets shall be transferred to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall be
authorized to endorse for collection and deposit (but without recourse) in
Purchaser's accounts any checks in any Sellers' name received by Purchaser or
Sellers (or any lock box party) in respect of the Purchased Assets, from and
after the Closing.

         8.5 Confidentiality. Each Seller agrees with Purchaser that such Seller
shall not, and that such Seller shall cause its Affiliates not to, and shall not
authorize its representatives to, at any time on or after the Closing Date,
directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, disclose
or use, any confidential or proprietary information (including the Subscriber
Lists) involving or relating to the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities;
provided, however, that the information subject to the foregoing provisions of
this sentence shall not include any information generally available to, or known
by, the public (other than as a result of disclosure in violation hereof); and
provided, further, that the provisions of this Section 8.5 will not prohibit any
retention of copies of records or disclosure (i) required by any applicable Law
so long as reasonable prior notice of such disclosure is provided to Purchaser
and a reasonable opportunity is afforded to contest the same or (ii) made in
connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Sellers agree that they will
be responsible for any breach or violation of the provisions of this Section 8.5
by any of their representatives.

         8.6 Publicity. Neither Sellers nor Purchaser shall issue any press
release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other
parties hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
unless, in the sole judgment of Purchaser or Sellers, disclosure is otherwise
required by applicable Law or with respect to filings to be made with the
Bankruptcy Court in connection with this Agreement or by the applicable rules of
any stock exchange or similar public trading system on which Purchaser or a
Seller lists securities, provided that the party intending to make such release
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such applicable
Law, Bankruptcy Court requirement or rules to consult with the other party with
respect to the text thereof.

         8.7 No Solicitation by Sellers.

                (a) The sale pursuant to this Agreement is an integral part of
the Settlement Agreement between Sellers and Purchaser. In consideration of the
compromises and settlements set forth therein, no Seller shall, nor shall any
Seller authorize or permit any of its Affiliates, any of their respective
directors, officers or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative (collectively,
"Representatives") retained by any Seller or any of their Affiliates to,
directly or indirectly through another Person, solicit, initiate or encourage,
or take any other action intended to, or which could reasonably be expected to,
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a transaction involving the sale, lease, license or


                                       37
<PAGE>
other disposition of the Subscriber Lists or any material portion of the other
Purchased Assets (a "Covered Transaction"). Without limiting the foregoing, it
is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence by any Representative of any Sellers or any of their Affiliates shall
be a breach of this Section 8.7 by Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time prior to obtaining the Approval Order, in response to an unsolicited
proposal for or inquiry that Sellers believe reasonably could lead to a proposal
for a Covered Transaction which was made prior to or after the date hereof,
Sellers may (A) furnish information with respect to the Sellers (which in no
event shall include the Subscriber Lists or specific lists setting forth the
names, addresses or telephone numbers, or other specific information, relating
to the identity of dealers or retailers of Sellers or their Affiliates) to the
Person making such proposal or inquiry pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement ("Third Party Confidentiality Agreement", which term includes any such
agreement heretofore executed by any Seller) not less restrictive of such Person
than the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that all such information not
previously provided to Purchaser is provided to Purchaser prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person, and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such proposal
or inquiry regarding such Covered Transaction.

                (b) In addition to the obligations of Sellers set forth in
Section 8.7(a), Sellers shall promptly (and in any event within 48 hours) advise
Purchaser orally and in writing and provide copies of (i) the execution of a
Third Party Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) the receipt by Sellers or any of
their Affiliates or the Creditors' Committee of any written proposal, and any
written amendments or modifications thereto, for any Covered Transaction.

         8.8 Notification of Certain Matters. Sellers and Purchaser shall give
prompt notice to the other parties if any Person provides written notice to any
such party that (a) the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Settlement
Agreement or the Cooperation Agreement or (b) such Person is not likely to
provide a required consent prior to Closing. Sellers and Purchaser shall also
give prompt notice to the other party if such party receives any written
objection or proceeding that challenges the transactions contemplated hereby or
the entry of the Approval Order. Sellers and Purchaser shall give prompt notice
to the other party of (i) any alleged violation of Law applicable to any such
party, (ii) any written notice of the commencement of any investigation, inquiry
or review by any Governmental Body with respect to the Business or that any such
investigation, inquiry or review, to the Knowledge of Sellers or to Purchaser's
actual knowledge after due inquiry, is contemplated, or (iii) any breach by such
notifying party of any representation or warranty or any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement applicable to such notifying party. Purchaser shall
give prompt notice to Sellers, and Sellers shall give prompt notice to
Purchaser, in the event that the other party becomes aware of any event which
could reasonably be expected to (i) have a Material Adverse Effect or (ii)
provide any party with the ability to terminate the Agreement

         8.9 Service to Active Subscribers. Purchaser will provide the
contractually required DIRECTV Services to any Active Subscriber whose
pre-payment for such DIRECTV Services is reflected in the calculation of Final
Net Working Capital Amount; provided, however, if such Active Subscriber
terminates the service, DIRECTV will refund the unused portion of such pre-paid
amount.

                         EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

         9.1 Employment and Benefits.

                (a) Subject to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, within
two (2) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Sellers shall provide
Purchaser with the Employee List and an opportunity to review the employment
files and other related documents of all Employees so that Purchaser may
determine, in its sole discretion, to whom Purchaser will extend offers of
employment. Prior to the Closing, Sellers agree to periodically update the
Employee List and deliver such updated Employee List to Purchaser. Not less than
fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall provide Sellers
with a list of those Employees, if any, to whom Purchaser may extend offers of
employment pursuant to Section 9.1(b) (the "Designated Employees"). Sellers
consent to the hiring of the Designated Employees by Purchaser and waive, with
respect to the employment by Purchaser of Designated Employees, any claims or
rights Sellers may have against Purchaser or any Designated Employee (except to
the extent such claims or rights are assigned to Purchaser hereunder) under any
non-competition, confidentiality or employment agreement to the extent
pertaining to the Business.

                (b) Subject to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, prior to
the Closing, Purchaser may deliver in writing an offer of employment to each of
the Designated Employees to commence employment immediately following the
Closing. Purchaser shall condition the employment of any Designated Employee on
such Designated Employee agreeing to waive any severance benefits payable by
Sellers to such Designated Employee. Purchaser may employ any of the Designated
Employees upon those terms that it may establish in its discretion, and it is
understood that such terms may differ from Sellers' employment terms in various
material respects, subject to Section 9.1(f).

                (c) Subject to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, except as
provided for in Section 9.1(d), Sellers shall be responsible for any and all
Liabilities arising out of or relating to (i) the employment by or performance
of services for Sellers or any of their Affiliates, or termination of employment
or services by Sellers or any of their Affiliates, of (x) the Transferring
Employees for periods ending on and prior to the Closing and (y) all other
individuals, including the Employees who are not Transferring Employees and the
former employees of the Business, whenever arising, and (ii) any Employee
Benefit Plan, whenever arising, including such Liabilities relating to any and
all wages, salaries, benefits and other compensation or payments (including
accrued vacation, leave, sick leave, bonuses, commissions and other
incentive-based compensation) and any and all severance (other than severance
benefits waived by any Transferring Employees or payable to any Transferring
Employee pursuant to Section 9.1(f)), retention bonus or change in control
payment payable to any of the Employees that become due or owing as a result of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.


                                       39
<PAGE>
                (d) Subject to the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall become responsible for any and all wages,
salaries, benefits and other compensation or payments payable to each Designated
Employee who is hired by Purchaser on or after the Closing Date (a "Transferring
Employee") for periods following the Closing Date on such terms and conditions
as Purchaser and each Transferring Employee may agree. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, (i) Purchaser shall have no obligation to
offer employment to, or to employ, any Employee and (ii) Purchaser shall have
the right to terminate any Transferring Employee for any reason after the
Closing Date. Purchaser and Sellers agree that the Employees are not third party
beneficiaries of this Agreement. On or after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
be responsible for providing any benefits and amounts payable to Transferring
Employees pursuant to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and
any similar laws and for providing any severance benefits for Transferring
Employees to which Section 9.1(b) refers, and neither Sellers nor any of their
Affiliates shall have any Liability in those respects. On or after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall be responsible for satisfying all health care continuation
requirements of COBRA, including Part 6 of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of
the Code, and similar laws and neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates shall
have any Liability in those respects (i) with respect to Transferring Employees,
and qualified beneficiaries with respect to Transferring Employees, incurring
any qualifying event after the Closing Date, and (ii) in the event that Sellers
and Sellers' ERISA Affiliates cease to provide any group health plan, with
respect to Transferring Employees, and all qualified beneficiaries with respect
to Transferring Employees, incurring any qualifying event before, on or after
the Closing Date.

                (e) Pursuant to the "Alternate Procedure" provided in Section 5
of Revenue Procedure 96 60, 1996 2 C.B. 399, (a) Purchaser and Sellers shall
report on a predecessor/successor basis as set forth therein, (b) Sellers will
be relieved from filing a Form W 2 with respect to any Transferring Employees
for the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, and (c) Purchaser will
undertake to file (or cause to be filed) a Form W 2 for each such Transferring
Employee with respect to the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs,
including the portion of such year that such Employee was employed by such
Seller.

                (f) For a period of one year following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall provide each Transferring Employee with severance benefits that
are no less favorable than the severance benefits that would have been provided
by Sellers to such Transferring Employees immediately prior to the Commencement
Date and as set forth in the First Lodge Affidavit and the Second Lodge
Affidavit. Purchaser shall provide Transferring Employees with health benefits
that, in the aggregate, are substantially equivalent to those provided by
Purchaser to its other similarly situated employees. Such benefits shall have no
exclusions for pre-existing conditions and all services with Sellers shall be
considered as service with Purchaser for purposes of satisfying any waiting
periods to participate in such benefits.

                (g) Except as provided for in Section 9.1(d), Sellers and their
ERISA Affiliates shall be exclusively responsible for complying with COBRA with
respect to their Employees and their eligible dependents by reason of such
Employees' termination of employment with Sellers and their ERISA Affiliates,
and neither Purchaser nor any of their ERISA Affiliates shall have any Liability
to provide COBRA on account of any such termination of employment.

                (h) So that Purchaser may prepare to accept rollovers from those
Transferring Employees who desire to roll their account balances from Sellers'
401(k) plans into Purchaser's 401(k) plan, prior to the Closing, Sellers shall
provide Purchaser with the most recent IRS determination letter with respect to
each qualified plan that Sellers maintain. If Purchaser considers such letter
for Sellers' 401(k) plans to be outdated or the letter is not favorable, or if
the plans have no individual determination letter, Sellers will explain to
Purchaser (and provide promptly any requested documentation therefor) the
reasons for the absence of a sufficiently recent favorable determination letter
from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service with respect to each such Employee
Benefit Plan that is designed to be a qualified plan. If Purchaser accepts such
explanation and documentation as evidence that Sellers' 401(k) plans are
properly qualified, Sellers shall cooperate reasonably with Purchaser to allow
those Transferring Employees who wish to do so to roll over their account
balances (including any unpaid loan balances, to the extent permitted under the
Purchaser's 401(k) plans) to Purchaser's 401(k) plan, and to otherwise achieve a
smooth transition regarding any rollovers elected by the Transferring Employees.
Sellers shall be responsible for providing any required blackout notices, within
the meaning of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, with respect to each such
Employee Benefit Plan, shall maintain the assets of each such Employee Benefit
Plan in the manner required by ERISA until such assets are distributed to
participants and beneficiaries.

certificate signed by an authorized officer of each Seller, dated as of the
Closing Date, to the foregoing effect;

                (b) Each Seller shall have performed and complied with all

provided, however, that if Sellers fail to deliver the Sellers' Pre-Closing Net
Working Capital Adjustment Certificate as provided for in Section 3.2(g) or the
Sellers' Cash Flow Adjustment Certificate as provided for in Section 3.2(e),
then Purchaser shall waive this condition and Sellers shall be obligated to
consummate (assuming the satisfaction of the other conditions set forth in this
Article X) the Closing based on Purchaser's good faith estimate (to be delivered
to Sellers within one (1) Business Day prior to the Closing) of the items that
would have been set forth on the Sellers' Pre-Closing Net Working Capital
Adjustment Certificate and the Sellers' Cash Flow Adjustment Certificate; and

                (d) Sellers shall have delivered, or caused to be delivered, to

                (a) The representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in
this Agreement (without giving effect to any qualifications or limitations as to
materiality or material adverse effect set forth therein) shall be true and
correct, as of the Closing Date as though made at and as of the Closing Date,
except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly relate to an
earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date, and except further to the
extent that the facts or matters as to which such representations and warranties
are not so true and correct as of such dates, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
ability of Purchaser to consummate the transactions taken as a whole
contemplated by this Agreement, the Cooperation Agreement (to the extent not
previously terminated) and the Settlement Agreement, and Sellers shall have
received a certificate signed by an authorized officer of Purchaser, dated as of
the Closing Date, to the foregoing effect;


                                       42
<PAGE>
                (b) Purchaser shall have performed and complied with all
obligations and agreements required in this Agreement to be performed or
complied with by it prior to the Closing Date, except where the failure to have
so performed or complied, would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the ability of Purchaser to consummate the transactions taken
as a whole contemplated by this Agreement, the Cooperation Agreement (to the
extent not previously terminated) and the Settlement Agreement, and Sellers
shall have received certificate signed by an authorized officer of Purchaser,
dated the Closing Date, to the foregoing effect; and

respective obligations of Purchaser and each Seller to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are subject to the fulfillment, on
or prior to the Closing Date, of each of the following conditions (any or all of
which may be waived by Purchaser and Sellers in whole or in part to the extent
permitted by applicable Law):

                (a) there shall not be in effect any Order enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of all material elements of the
transactions contemplated hereby;

                (b) the Bankruptcy Court shall have entered the Approval Order
and the Settlement Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not
have been modified or amended without the prior written consent of Purchaser or
in a manner materially adverse to Purchaser or Sellers as the case may be;

                (c) the Bankruptcy Court shall have entered the Approval Order
and any stay period applicable to the Approval Order shall have expired or shall
have been waived by the Bankruptcy Court, the Approval Order shall not have been
modified or amended in a manner adverse to Purchaser without the prior written
consent of Purchaser or in a manner materially adverse to Purchase or Sellers as
the case may be, and shall remain in full force and effect; and

                (d) subject to section 363(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, the
waiting period applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under the HSR Act shall have expired or early termination shall have been
granted.

         10.4 Frustration of Closing Conditions. Neither Seller nor Purchaser
may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 10.1, 10.2 or
10.3, as the case may be, if such failure was caused (through action or
omission) solely by such party's failure to comply with any provision of this
Agreement.

<PAGE>
                                   ARTICLE XI

                                      TAXES

         11.1 Transfer Taxes. (a) Purchaser shall be responsible for, and
indemnify Sellers against, all sales, use, stamp, documentary stamp, filing,
recording, transfer or similar fees or Taxes or governmental charges (including
any interest and penalty thereon) payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the transfer of DIRECTV Equipment to
Purchaser ("Transfer Taxes"). Sellers shall seek to include in the Approval
Order a provision that provides that the transfer of the Purchased Assets shall
be free and clear of any stamp or similar Taxes under section 1146(c) of the
Bankruptcy Code. The parties shall reasonably cooperate to minimize any such
Taxes, including with respect to delivery location.

                (b) Purchaser will have the right, and obligation, to negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Tax Authority with respect to any dispute or
audit regarding the Transfer Taxes and shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers
for any such Transfer Taxes. At Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers a
resale or other tax exemption certificate, as applicable. No Seller shall settle
any dispute contemplated in this Section 11.1 with any Taxing Authority without
the prior written consent of Purchaser.

         11.2 Prorations. All real and personal property Taxes or similar ad
valorem obligations levied with respect to the Purchased Assets for any taxable
period that ends prior to the Closing Date shall be paid by Sellers,
irrespective of the reporting and payment dates of such Taxes. All real and
personal property Taxes or similar ad valorem obligations levied with respect to
the Purchased Assets for any taxable period that includes the Closing Date and
ends after the Closing Date, whether imposed or assessed before or after the
Closing Date, shall be prorated between Sellers and Purchaser as of 11:59 p.m.
(Eastern time) on the Closing Date. With respect to Taxes described in this
Section 11.2, Sellers shall prepare and timely file all Tax Returns due before
the Closing Date with respect to such Taxes and Purchaser shall prepare and
timely file all Tax Returns due after the Closing Date with respect to such
Taxes. If any Taxes subject to proration are paid by Purchaser, on the one hand,
and Sellers, on the other hand, the proportionate amount of such Taxes paid (or
in the event of a refund of any portion of such Taxes previously paid is
received, such refund) shall be paid promptly by (or to) the other after the
payment of such Taxes (or promptly following the receipt of any such refund).

         11.3 Purchase Price Allocation. Purchaser shall, within forty five (45)
days after the Closing Date, prepare and deliver to Sellers a schedule (the
"Allocation Schedule") reasonably allocating the Purchase Price and the Assumed
Liabilities among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder or any successor
provisions. Sellers will have the right to raise reasonable objections to the
Allocation Schedule within thirty (30) days after their receipt thereof, in
which event Purchaser and Sellers will negotiate in good faith to resolve such
objections. If Purchaser and Sellers cannot mutually resolve Sellers' reasonable
objections to the Allocation Schedule within twenty (20) days after Purchaser's


                                       44
<PAGE>
receipt of such objections, such dispute shall be presented to the Referee for a
decision that shall be rendered by such accounting firm within thirty (30)
calendar days thereafter and shall be final and binding upon each of the
parties. The fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith shall be
shared in equal amounts by Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other
hand. Purchaser and Sellers each shall report and file all Tax Returns
(including amended Tax Returns and claims for refund) consistent with the
Allocation Schedule, and shall take no position with respect to Taxes contrary
thereto or inconsistent therewith (including in any audits or examinations by
any taxing authority or any other proceedings) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate in the
filing of any forms (including Form 8594) with respect to such allocation,
including any amendments to such forms required with respect to any adjustment
to the Purchase Price, pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Article XI shall survive
the Closing without limitation.

         11.4 Cooperation on Tax Matters. Purchaser and Sellers shall furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance relating to the Purchased Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities as is reasonably necessary for the preparation and filing of any Tax
Return, claim for refund or other required or optional filings relating to Tax
matters, for the preparation for any Tax audit, for the preparation for any Tax
protest, or for the prosecution or defense of any suit or other proceeding
relating to Tax matters (including to challenges to provisions regarding Taxes
sought in the Approval Order), and Purchaser shall pay the reasonable out of
pocket costs, including attorneys and other professional fees and costs,
incurred by Sellers with respect to any such actions taken at the request of
Purchaser, or otherwise legally required to be taken by Sellers, including due
to a conflict of interests, in respect of Taxes (including Transfer Taxes) for
which Purchaser is responsible under this Agreement, and Sellers shall pay the
reasonable out of pocket costs, including attorneys and other professional fees
and costs, incurred by Purchaser with respect to any such actions taken at the
request of Sellers, or otherwise legally required to be taken by Purchaser,
including due to a conflict of interests, in respect of Taxes for which Sellers
are responsible under this Agreement

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         12.1 Reservation of Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement,
it is acknowledged and understood that there exist disputes between the parties
regarding the Purchased Assets, including pre-existing disputes about ownership,
rights to use, access and what is in fact an asset or right of Sellers or
Purchaser, including with respect to Subscriber Information. If the Closing does
not occur, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a waiver of any claim
relating to such assets or rights or an admission with respect to any claim
relating to such pre-existing disputes or other matters. If the Closing does
occur, the Settlement Agreement shall be effective in accordance with its terms.


                                       45
<PAGE>
         12.2 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations
and warranties and the obligations of the parties to be performed on or prior to
the Closing Date contained in this Agreement shall be extinguished by and shall
not survive Closing, and no claims may be asserted with respect thereto and no
party shall have any Liability for any breach thereof after the Closing.

         12.3 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of
Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, shall bear their own
expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and each other agreement, document and instrument contemplated by this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall each
be responsible for 50% of the filing fees associated with the HSR Act filings.

         12.4 Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

                (a) Without limiting any party's right to appeal any order of
the Bankruptcy Court, (i) the Bankruptcy Court shall retain exclusive
jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Agreement and to decide any claims or
disputes which may arise or result from, or be connected with, this Agreement,
any breach or default hereunder, or the transactions contemplated hereby (other
than any claims or disputes relating to items set forth on any Dispute Notice;
it being understood that such claims and disputes will be subject solely to the
decision of the Referee), and (ii) any and all proceedings related to the
foregoing shall be filed and maintained only in the Bankruptcy Court, and the
parties hereby consent to and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of the
Bankruptcy Court and shall receive notices at such locations as indicated in
Section 12.8; provided, however, that if the Chapter 11 Case has closed or if
the Bankruptcy Court elects to not exercise its jurisdiction, the parties agree
to unconditionally and irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in
New York County or the Commercial Division, Civil Branch of the Supreme Court of
the State of New York sitting in New York County and any appellate court from
any thereof, for the resolution of any such claim or dispute. The parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the
maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a judgment
in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

                (b) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process being
served by any party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by
delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.8.

         12.5 Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury. Each party to this Agreement
waives any right to trial by jury in any action, matter or proceeding regarding
this Agreement or any provision hereof.


                                       46
<PAGE>
         12.6 Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement
(including the Schedules and Exhibits), the Seller Documents and the Purchaser
Documents represent the entire understanding and agreement between the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement can be amended,
supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written
instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party
against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or
waiver is sought; provided, further, that if such party against whom enforcement
is sought is Sellers or if Sellers are giving any written notice under this
Agreement, the written instrument must also be signed by a representative of the
Creditors' Committee. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed
to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by
any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a
waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such
right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

         12.7 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts
made and performed in such State, irrespective of and without regard for its
conflicts of law principles, as to all matters, including matters of validity,
construction, effect, enforceability, performance and remedies.

         12.8 Notices. All notices and other communications under this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) when delivered personally by
hand (with written confirmation of receipt by the addressee thereof or any other
person at such address ), (b) when sent by facsimile (with confirmation of
transmission) or (c) one Business Day following the day sent by overnight
courier (with written confirmation of receipt by the addressee thereof or any
other person at such address), in each case at the following addresses and

have specified by notice given to the other party pursuant to this provision):

         12.9 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.


                                       48

         12.10 Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, and, additionally with respect to Sellers, shall be binding
upon any chapter 11 or 7 trustee appointed or elected for Sellers and shall not
be discharged by any plan of reorganization or liquidation that may be confirmed
in the Chapter 11 Case, the conversion of such case to Chapter 7, or the
dismissal of any such case. Sellers hereby agree that the terms of any plan
submitted by Sellers to the Bankruptcy Court for confirmation shall not be in
conflict with, supersede, abrogate, nullify, modify or restrict the terms of
this Agreement and the rights of Purchaser hereunder, or in any way prevent or
interfere with the consummation or performance of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including, without limitation, any transaction that is
contemplated by or approved pursuant to the Approval Order. Nothing in this
Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights
in any Person not a party to this Agreement. No assignment of this Agreement or
of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any Seller or Purchaser
(by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto and any attempted assignment without the required consents
shall be void; provided, however, that Purchaser may assign its right to
purchase the Purchased Assets or its obligation to assume the Assumed
Liabilities or any other of its rights or obligations to one or more Affiliates
of Purchaser without the consent of Sellers. No assignment of any obligations
hereunder shall relieve the parties hereto of any such obligations. Upon any
such permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to Purchaser shall
also apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

         12.11 Non-Recourse. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator or stockholder of any Seller or Purchaser shall have any
liability for any obligations or liabilities of Sellers or Purchaser under this
Agreement or the Seller Documents or the Purchaser Documents of or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby.

         12.12 Guarantee. The DIRECTV Group, Inc. hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally guarantees the due and punctual performance of Purchaser's
financial obligations under this Agreement.

         12.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement.

         12.14 Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that a
breach of this Agreement would cause irreparable damage to the non breaching
party and that such party will not have an adequate remedy at law. Therefore,
the obligations of each Seller and Purchaser under this Agreement, including
Sellers' obligation to sell the Purchased Assets and Purchaser's obligation to
assume the Assumed Liabilities and pay the Net Purchase Price, shall be
enforceable by a decree of specific performance issued by the Bankruptcy Court,
and appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection
therewith
