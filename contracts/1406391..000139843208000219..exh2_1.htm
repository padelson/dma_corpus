Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of Merger Sub 2 issued and

Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger I Effective Time.

Restricted Shares_ ") and, upon the lapsing of such restrictions, the Parent
shall be entitled to withhold such amounts as may be required to be withheld

with _Section 2.10_ , receive from the Parent, in lieu of such fractional
share, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (i) such

consented to the First Merger and who have properly demanded and perfected
their rights to be paid the fair value of such shares in accordance with
Section 262 of

 


  

 

18

  

 



 

the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the merger
consideration in accordance with _Section 2.7(a)_ , and the holders thereof
shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the
DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the Merger I Effective Time, any
such stockholder of the Company shall fail to perfect or shall effectively
waive, withdraw, or lose such stockholders rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL, such stockholders shares of Company Capital Stock in respect of which
the stockholder would otherwise be entitled to receive fair value under
Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at
the Merger I Effective Time, into the merger consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.7(a)_ without any interest thereon.

 

2.10 _Surrender of Certificates_

 

(a) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Merger
I Effective Time, the Parent shall mail, or cause to be mailed, to each holder
of record of a certificate representing shares of Company Capital Stock ("
_Certificates_ "): (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Parent and which shall be in customary form and contain customary provisions)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for the certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement. Each holder of record of one or more Certificates shall,
upon surrender to the Parent of such Certificate or Certificates, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Parent, be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor: (A) a certificate or certificates representing that number of
shares of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates
surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is then entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.7(a)_ as applicable, and (B) an amount equal to the cash payable
in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section
2.7(j)_ , and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Capital Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, as applicable, a
certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock
may be issued in accordance with this _Section 2.10(a)_ to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the transfer or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Parent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.10(a)_ ,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Merger I Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.7(a_), and cash payable in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.7(j)_. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any payment to holders of
Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_.

 

(b) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date
on or after the Merger I Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
that the holder thereof has the right to receive

 


  

 

19

  

 



 

upon the surrender thereof in each case until the holder of such Certificate
shall have surrendered such Certificate in accordance with this _Article II_.
Following the surrender of any Certificate, there shall be paid to the record
holder of the certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after the
Merger I Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after the Merger I
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights_. The shares of Parent Common Stock issued
upon conversion of the shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof and the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.7(j)_ upon the surrender of Certificates
in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have
been in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Capital Stock formerly represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to
the Parents obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions
with a record date prior to the Merger I Effective Time which may have been
declared or made by the Company on the shares of Company Capital Stock, as
applicable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the Merger
I Effective Time. At the close of business on the day on which the Merger I
Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share
transfer books of the Merger I Surviving Entity of the shares of Company
Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Merger I
Effective Time. If, after the Merger I Effective Time, any Certificate is
presented to the Merger I Surviving Entity for transfer, it shall be canceled
against delivery of and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 



 

(d) _Required Withholding_. The Parent and the Surviving Entity shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Company Capital Stock such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax
law or under any other applicable legal requirement. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
2.10_ , no party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company
Capital Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

2.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, subject to receipt of
a duly executed letter of transmittal, the Parent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon receipt by the Parent of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the certificates representing
the shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company Capital
Stock formerly represented by

 


  

 

20

  

 



 

such Certificates were converted or exchanged, and pay any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, _provided_ that the holder of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates shall have first indemnified the Parent
against any claim that may be made against the Parent or the Merger I
Surviving Entity with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

 

2.12 _Escrow_. At the Closing, the Parent shall issue in accordance with this
_Section 2.12_ and deposit in escrow on behalf of the Securityholders a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Escrow Shares_ ") equal to
$25,000,000 divided by the Assumed Value, all in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement. Each Securityholder agrees that the
Parent shall deposit on behalf of such Securityholder that number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to such Securityholders Escrow Pro Rata Percentage
of the Escrow Shares. The Escrow Shares shall be issued by the Parent at the
Closing in certificated form in the name of the Escrow Agent. At the Closing,
each of the Parent and the Securityholders Representative shall, and the
Parent shall cause the Escrow Agent to, execute and deliver the Escrow
Agreement.

 

2.13 _Relationship Among the Securityholders_

 

(a) Each Securityholder hereby irrevocably appoints the Securityholders
Representative as the sole representative of the Securityholders to act as the

6.2 _No Control of the Parent or the Company_. The parties acknowledge and
agree that: (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give to either the
Parent or the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct
the operations of the other prior to the Merger I Effective Time, (b) prior to
the Merger I Effective Time, each of the Parent and the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over it and its Subsidiaries\' operations, and (c)
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
consent of either party shall be required with respect to any matter set forth
in _Section 6.1_ or elsewhere in this Agreement to the extent the requirement
of such consent would violate any applicable law.

 

6.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality; Public Announcements_

  

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of (i)
the Closing Date and (ii) the termination of the Agreement in accordance with
_Article IX_ , except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law or the terms
of any Contract entered into prior to the date hereof to which the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or the Parent is a party or as would be reasonably
expected to violate the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine,
self-audit privilege or the similar privilege of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or the Parent (it being agreed that the parties shall use their
reasonable efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that
does not cause such violation or prohibition) and, subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information and the preservation of any applicable
attorney-client privilege, work-product doctrine, self-audit privilege or
other similar privilege, each party shall give the other party and its
authorized representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to
all of its books, records, offices and other facilities and properties as such
other party, or its authorized representatives, may from time to time
reasonably request from either the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial
Officer of the party; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access shall be
conducted in a manner not to materially interfere with the businesses or
operations of the party and no party shall conduct any invasive sampling or
testing with respect to the real property of the other party.

 

(b) Any information provided to or obtained by the Parent or its authorized
representatives pursuant to paragraph (a) above shall be " _Evaluation
Materials_ " (herein referred to as " _Evaluation Material_ ") as defined in
the Mutual Nondisclosure Confidentiality Agreement, dated January 21, 2008, by
and between WF Holdings and the Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
and shall be held by the Parent in accordance with and be subject to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the terms and provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms
therein. In the event of the termination of this Agreement for any reason,
the Parent shall comply with the terms and provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, including returning or destroying all Evaluation Material and the
non-soliciting of employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate on the Closing Date.

 

(c) Each of the Parent and the Company agrees to consult and obtain the
approval of the other before issuing any press release or announcement
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall not issue or cause
to be issued any such press release prior to such consultation and approval
except as such release or announcement may be

 


  

 

52

  

 



 

required by Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith
with the other party and attempt to agree upon mutually satisfactory text
before issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement. 

 

6.4 _Filings and Authorizations; Consummation_

  

(a) Each of the Parent, the Company and the Merger Subs hereto shall, if
required by applicable Law, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof,
file or supply, or cause to be filed or supplied in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein, all notifications and information required
to be filed or supplied pursuant to the HSR Act. The Parent acknowledges and
agrees that it shall pay and shall be solely responsible for the payment of
all filing fees and other charges for the filing under the HSR Act.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto, as promptly as practicable, shall make, or
cause to be made, all other filings and submissions under Laws applicable to
it, or to its Subsidiaries and Affiliates, as may be required for it to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein and use its commercially
reasonable efforts (which shall not require either party to make any payment
or concession to any Person in connection with obtaining such Persons
consent) to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all other authorizations,
approvals, consents and waivers from all Persons and Governmental Authorities
necessary to be obtained by it, or its subsidiaries or affiliates, in order
for it to consummate such transactions. Subject to applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information and the preservation of any applicable
attorney-client privilege, work-product doctrine, self-audit privilege or
other similar privilege, each of the Company and the Parent shall have the
right to review and comment on in advance, and to the extent practicable each
will consult the other on, all the information relating to such party, that
appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third
party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
set forth in this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the
Company and the Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

 

(c) The parties hereto shall coordinate and cooperate with one another in
exchanging and providing such information to each other and in making the
filings and requests referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) above. The parties
hereto shall supply such reasonable assistance as may be reasonably requested
by any other party hereto in connection with the foregoing.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if any order is made by
any Governmental Authority or any suit is threatened or instituted challenging
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any
Antitrust Law, the Parent shall take all such action (including agreeing to
hold separate or to divest any of the businesses, product lines or assets of
the Parent or any of its Affiliates or of the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or their respective Affiliates; provided, however, that any material
divestment of any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates shall require the
written consent of the Company) as may be required (i) by the applicable
Governmental Authority (including the Antitrust Division of the United States

 


  

 

53

  

 



 

Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission) in order to resolve
such objections as such Governmental Authority may have to such transactions
under such Antitrust Law or (ii) by any domestic or foreign court or similar
tribunal, in any suit brought by any Person or Governmental Authority
challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of
any Antitrust Law, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order
that has the effect of preventing the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. It shall not be deemed a failure to satisfy
the conditions specified in _Sections 7.4_ or _Sections 8.4_ , if in any suit
brought by any Person or Governmental Authority challenging the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, a court
enters or the applicable Governmental Authority makes an order or decree
permitting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but requiring that
any of the businesses, product lines or assets of any of the Parent or its
Affiliates or of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or their respective
Affiliates be divested or held separate by the Parent, or that would otherwise
limit the Parents freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain, the Company and any Company Subsidiary or any portion thereof or any
of the Parents or its Affiliates other assets or businesses; provided,
however, that in each case where a sale or divestment of any of the
businesses, product lines or assets of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or
their respective Affiliates is required to comply with the terms of any order
or decree by a court or other Governmental Authority, the Parent shall first
have obtained the Companys written consent, if required, as set forth above.

 

(e) The Parent and the Company shall promptly inform the other of any material
communication from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or
any other Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If the Parent or the Company or any Affiliate
thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material
from any such Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will endeavor in good faith to
make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request. The Parent will advise the Company promptly in respect of any
understandings, undertakings or agreements (whether oral or written) which the
Parent proposes to make or enter into with the Federal Trade Commission, the
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.5 _Resignations_. The Parent shall cause to be delivered to the Company on
the Closing Date such resignations of the officers and members of the Board of
Directors of the Parent as set forth on _Exhibit C_ attached hereto, such
resignations to be effective concurrently with the Closing.

 

6.6 _Members of the Board of Directors and Officers of Parent following Merger
I Effective Time_

  

(a) At any time prior to the mailing of the Parent Proxy Statement, the
Securityholders Representative shall designate, in its sole discretion (after
consultation with the Company and its Chief Executive Officer), two (2)
members, each of whom will be independent (the " _Securityholders 
Representative Director Designees_"), to serve as members of the Board of
Directors of the Parent immediately following the Merger I Effective Time;

 


  

 

54

  

 



 

 _provided_ , that, if any of Securityholders Representative Director
Designees are unable or unwilling to serve as directors of the Parent for any
reason, the Securityholders Representative shall designate, in its sole
discretion, their replacements or substitutes. Subject to the foregoing, the
Parent shall take such action as is necessary to cause the Securityholders
Representative Director Designees and Greg C. Mosher, so long as he is Chief
Executive Officer of the Company as of the Closing Date, to be appointed to
the Board of Directors of the Parent and as Chairman effective as of the
Merger I Effective Time, to serve until the earlier of such individuals
resignation or removal or until his successor is duly elected and qualified.

 

(b) The parties hereto will take all actions necessary or advisable so that,
effective as of the Merger I Effective Time, all officers of the Parent shall
resign and the officers of the Company prior to the First Merger shall be the
officers of the Parent.

 

6.7 _Parent s Certificate of Incorporation_. The Parent will take all action
necessary to amend and restate its certificate of incorporation in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , subject to stockholder approval and effective
as of the Merger I Effective Time.

 

6.8 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each of
the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill or
obtain the fulfillment of the conditions precedent to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the execution and delivery of any
documents, certificates, instruments or other papers that are reasonably
required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that if the Company, pursuant to the exercise of its rights
under the relevant agreements does not consummate the Target 1 Acquisition or
the Target 2 Acquisition, such that the condition set forth in _Section 7.13_
is not satisfied, such failure by the Company shall not be deemed a breach of
this _Section 6.8_ so long as the Company shall have used commercially
reasonable efforts to consummate the Target 1 Acquisition and the Target 2
Acquisition.

 

6.9 _Transfer of Shares_. Except for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, from the date hereof until the Closing Date, each Securityholder
agrees that it shall not transfer record or beneficial ownership of any shares
of the Companys Capital Stock to any Person without the prior written consent
of the Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each Securityholder
shall have the right to transfer any record and beneficial ownership of any
shares of capital stock to any accredited investor, as such term is defined
under Rule 501 of the Securities Act, so long as (i) the Securityholders shall
collectively maintain voting control of the Company after any such transfer
until the earlier of the Merger I Effective Time or the termination of the
Merger Agreement; (ii) a transferee agrees to execute in writing a Joinder
Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Schedule 6.9_ pursuant to which the
transferee shall agree to become bound by the terms of this Agreement
(including the appointment of the Securityholders Representative as its
representative hereunder in accordance with _Section 2.13_ hereof) and the
Stockholders Agreement, dated as of November 30, 2005 among the Company and
the stockholders of this Company; and (iii) the transferring Securityholder
retains the right to vote such shares through the earlier of the Merger I
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , that,
notwithstanding such transfer, such Securityholder shall continue to be bound
by the terms of this Agreement as if such transfer had not occurred.

 

  

 

55

  

 



 

6.10 _Termination of Affiliate Obligations_. On or before the Closing Date,
except for the Assumed Indebtedness, liabilities relating to employment
relationships and the payment of compensation and benefits in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices and agreements to be entered
into at the Closing as contemplated hereunder, all liabilities and obligations
between the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and one or
more of its Affiliates or Securityholders (other than liabilities or
obligations between the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), on the other
hand, including any and all Contracts (other than this Agreement and any
ancillary agreement contemplated herein) between the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and one or more of its Affiliates (including the
Securityholders but not including the Company and any Company Subsidiary), on
the other hand, shall be terminated in full, without any liability for the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries following the Closing.

 

6.11 _Exclusivity_

  

(a) Subject to _Section 6.11(b)_ , until the earlier of the Closing and such
time as this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article IX_ and
except for transactions contemplated by this Agreement, neither the Company,
the Securityholders, the Parent nor SBBC (as applicable, the " _Applicable
Party_ ") shall, and the Applicable Party shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause each of its officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents
not to, directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate, engage or
participate in negotiations with any Person (other than the Parent or the
Company, as applicable (the " _Other Party_ ")) (a " _Third Party_ ")
concerning any Acquisition Transaction or (ii) take any other action intended
or designed to facilitate the efforts of any Person (other than the Other
Party) relating to a possible Acquisition Transaction. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Acquisition Transaction_ " shall mean any of the
following involving the Applicable Party or any of its Subsidiaries: (i) any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, acquisition, business combination or
other similar transaction; or (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or
other disposition of any of the assets of the Applicable Party or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than, in the case of the Company, in the normal course of
business consistent with past practice) or any shares of the capital stock of
the Applicable Party or any of its Subsidiaries in a single transaction or
series of transactions; _provided_ , that Acquisition Transaction shall not
include any transaction permitted by _Section 6.1_ of this Agreement or that
is contemplated by _Section 7.13_ of this Agreement.

 

(b) In the event that there is an unsolicited proposal for or an unsolicited
indication of a serious interest in entering into, an Acquisition Transaction,
communicated to the Applicable Party or any of its representatives or agents,
such party shall promptly (and in no event more than twenty-four (24) hours)
give written notice of same to the Other Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval or
the Parent Stockholder Approval, as applicable, the board of directors of the
Applicable Party (or a committee thereof), directly or indirectly through
advisors, agents or other intermediaries, may (i) engage in negotiations or
discussions with any Third Party that, subject to the Applicable Partys
compliance with _Section 6.11(a)_ , has made a bona fide unsolicited written
proposal for an Acquisition Transaction that the board of directors of the
Applicable Party (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith by
majority vote, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, (ii)
furnish to such Third Party nonpublic information relating to

 


  

 

56

  

 



 

the Applicable Party or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an appropriate
confidentiality agreement having provisions that are no less favorable to the
Applicable Party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, (iii)
no earlier than seventy-two (72) hours following receipt of such a bona fide
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that the board of directors of the Applicable
Party (or a committee thereof) has determined, in good faith by majority vote,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, is a
Superior Proposal, withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to the
Applicable Party, the recommendation of the Applicable Partys board of
directors in favor of approval of this Agreement and the Mergers (a " _Change
in Recommendation_ ") or, in the case of the Company, terminate the Agreement
in accordance with _Article IX_ , and/or (iv) take any nonappealable, final
action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders the Applicable Party to
take, but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii)
only if the board of directors of the Applicable Party (or a committee
thereof) determines in good faith by a majority vote, after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that it must take such action
to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide written
proposal regarding an Acquisition Transaction made by a Person other than a
party hereto (1) that is on terms that the board of directors of the
Applicable Party (after consultation with its outside financial advisor and
outside counsel) in good faith concludes to be more favorable from a financial
point of view to the Applicable Partys stockholders (in their capacity as
stockholders) than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking
into account all terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement
(including any adjustment by the Other Party to amend the terms of this
Agreement), (2) that is reasonably certain of being completed on the terms
proposed, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal, and (3) is fully financed and not subject to any
financing contingency.

 

(c) In addition, and notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval,
as applicable, the board of directors of the Applicable Party (or a committee
thereof) may, in response to a material development or change in circumstances
occurring or arising after the date hereof that was neither known to the board
of directors of the Applicable Party nor reasonably foreseeable as of or prior
to the date hereof (and not relating to any Acquisition Proposal) (such
material development or change in circumstances, an " _Intervening Event_ "),
make a Change in Recommendation if the board of directors of the Applicable
Party (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith, after consultation
with, and taking into account the advice of, its outside legal advisors, that,
in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of the board of directors (or
such committee) to effect such a Change in Recommendation would result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 6.11_ , the
Applicable Party shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Change
in Recommendation (or, in the case of the Company, terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Article IX_ ) unless the Applicable Party has (i) provided to
the Other Party at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice
(unless, in the case of a Change in Recommendation by the Parent for an
Intervening Event, the Intervening Event arises fewer than three (3) Business
Days prior to the Special Meeting) advising the Other Party that the Board of
Directors of the Applicable Party (or a committee thereof) intends to take
such action and specifying the reasons therefor in

 


  

 

57

  

 



 

reasonable detail and (ii) during such three (3) Business Day period, if
requested by the Other Party, engaged in good faith negotiations with the
Other Party to amend this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need
for a Change in Recommendation as a result of the Intervening Event or causes
the relevant Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.
Any Change in Recommendation shall not change the approval and recommendation
of this Agreement and the Merger or any other approval of the Board of
Directors of the Applicable Party (or any committee thereof) for purposes of
Section 251 of the DGCL or in any respect that would have the effect of
causing any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover statute or other
similar statute to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, including the Merger.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)
the obligation of the Parent to call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Special Meeting and to hold a vote of Parent Common Stockholders for the
purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval shall not be limited or
otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission
to it of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal), or by
a Change in Recommendation, and (ii) in any case in which the Parent makes a
Change in Recommendation pursuant to this _Section 6.11_ , (A) the Parent
shall nevertheless comply with its obligations as set forth in _Section 6.14_
and (B) the Proxy Statement and any and all accompanying materials (including
the proxy card (which shall provide that signed proxies which do not specify
the manner in which the shares of Parent Common Stock subject thereto are to
be voted shall be voted "FOR" the proposals relating to the Parent Stockholder
Approval), the " _Proxy Materials_ ") shall be identical in form and content
to Proxy Materials that would have been prepared by the Parent had no Change
in Recommendation been made, except for appropriate changes to the disclosure
in the Proxy Statement stating that (1) such Change in Recommendation has been
made, (2) if applicable, describing matters relating to the Acquisition
Proposal or Intervening Event giving rise to the Change in Recommendation to
the extent required by applicable Law or (3) any other appropriate changes to
the extent required by applicable Law (including, without limitation,
compliance with any fiduciary duties). 

 

(f) In addition to the obligations of the Applicable Party set forth in
paragraphs (a) through (e) of this _Section 6.11_ , the Applicable Party shall
as promptly as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
after receipt) advise the Other Party orally and in writing of any Acquisition
Proposal and the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition
Proposal (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making
any such Acquisition Proposal. The Applicable Party shall keep the Other
Party informed on a reasonably current basis of material developments with
respect to any such Acquisition Proposal.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.11_ shall prohibit the Applicable
Party from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) (2) or (3) under the Exchange Act or making a statement
required under Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (i) compliance with such rules shall in no way limit or modify the effect
that any such action pursuant to such rules has under this Agreement and (ii)
in no event shall the Applicable Party or its board of directors or any
committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by
_Section 6.11_.

 


  

 

58

  

 



 

(h) Each of the Company, the Securityholders, the Parent and SBBC represents
and warrants to the others that either (i) it is not, as of the date hereof,
engaged in negotiations with any other party regarding the subject matter of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Acquisition Proposal
relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or the Parent or (ii) in the event
that it is engaged in such negotiations, it shall terminate such negotiations
immediately.

 

6.12 _Employee Matters_

  

(a) From and after the Closing Date until the first (1st) anniversary thereof,
the Parent shall, or shall cause the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to,
honor all Contracts listed on _Schedule 6.12(a)_ on such terms (including
base compensation, bonus targets and fringe benefits) as in existence on the
Closing Date.

 

(b) Except as specifically provided herein, and to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws, the Parent shall cause service rendered by employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date to be taken
into account for purposes of participation, coverage, vesting and level of
benefits (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan), as applicable, under all severance payment plans, employee
benefit plans, programs and policies of the Parent and its subsidiaries
(including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) from and after the
Closing Date, to the same extent as such service was taken into account under
corresponding plans of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for such
purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall result in the
duplication of any benefits. Without limiting the foregoing, employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries will not be subject to any pre-existing
condition or limitation under any health or welfare plan of the Parent or its
subsidiaries (including the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) for any
condition for which such employee would have been entitled to coverage under
the corresponding plan of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in which
such employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date. The Parent
shall, and shall cause, such employees to be given credit under such plans for
co-payments made, and deductibles satisfied, prior to the Closing Date.

 

6.13 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_

  

(a) The Parent shall cause the organizational documents of the Surviving
Entity and each Subsidiary of the Surviving Entity to contain provisions
concerning indemnification of directors and officers no less favorable to the
beneficiaries thereof than those set forth in such organizational documents as
of the date hereof. From and after the Closing, the Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Entity and each Subsidiary of the Surviving Entity to (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
the Company and each present and former director, director and officer, as
applicable, of each Company Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Company
Indemnified Parties_ "), in each case, when acting in such capacity, against
any Losses incurred or suffered by any of the Company Indemnified Parties in
connection with any Action arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
and (ii) advance expenses as incurred by any Company Indemnified Party in
connection with any matters for which such

 


  

 

59

  

 



 

Company Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from the Surviving
Entity or a Subsidiary of the Surviving Entity, as applicable, pursuant to
this _Section 6.13_ , to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law;
_provided_ that the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to such indemnification;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required to be made with
respect to whether a Company Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the
standards set forth under applicable law or the organizational documents of
the Surviving Entity and the Subsidiaries of the Surviving Entity, as
applicable, shall be made by independent counsel selected by the Company.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Closing, the Parent shall
maintain, or shall cause the Surviving Entity for itself and the Surviving
Entitys Subsidiaries to maintain, in effect a directors and officers
liability insurance policy covering those persons who are currently covered by
the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (true and
complete copies of which have been heretofore made available by the Company to
the Parent and its agents and representatives) with coverage in amount and
scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing coverage. This _Section
6.13(b)_ shall be deemed to have been satisfied if a prepaid policy or
policies (i.e., "tail coverage") have been obtained by the Surviving Entity,
at the expense of the Parent, which policy or policies provide such directors
and officers with the coverage described in this _Section 6.13(b)_ for an
aggregate period of not less than six (6) years with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Closing Date, including
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) At Closing, the Parent will maintain its current directors and officers
liability insurance policy with AIG which provides for $10,000,000 of
aggregate coverage with a $250,000 retention and a crisis fund of $25,000 or
such other policy as may be mutually agreeable to the parties hereto. The
Parent shall maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy
with coverage in amount and scope at least as favorable as such policy for a
period of at least three (3) years from the Closing Date.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.13_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder, and each such Persons heirs, representatives,
successors or assigns, it being expressly agreed that such Persons shall be
third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.13_ , and (ii) in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other right to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise.

 

6.14 _Proxy Statement; Special Meeting_.

  

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, the Parent shall prepare
and file with the SEC a proxy statement (the " _Parent Proxy Statement_ "),
which shall include proxy materials for the purpose of soliciting proxies from
holders of Parent Common Stock to vote in favor of (i) the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the transactions set forth herein, (ii) the
amendment and restatement of the Parents certificate of incorporation in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ , (iii) the adoption of the Stock
Incentive Plan and the Cash

 


  

 

60

  

 



 

Bonus Plan and (iv) the change of the Parents name to Workflow Corporation,
at a meeting of the holders of Parent Common Stock to be called and held for
such purpose (the " _Special Meeting_ "). The Registration Statement shall
also include the Company Proxy Statement which shall include proxy materials
for the purpose of soliciting proxies from holders of the Companys Capital
Stock to vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the Mergers.

 

(b) The Company shall furnish to the Parent all information concerning the
Company as the Parent may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of the Parent Proxy Statement. The Parent, with the assistance of
the Company, shall promptly respond to any SEC comments on the Parent Proxy
Statement, and shall otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
any such SEC comments relating to the Parent Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Parent Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, the Parent shall provide the Company and the Securityholders
Representative with an opportunity to review and comment on such document or
response.

 

(c) The Parent shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the
Parent Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as
practicable after resolution of all SEC comments. Parent shall, as promptly

with the terms of _Section 10.4_ within the applicable survival period
provided above (as applicable, the " _Cut-Off Date_ "), the claims
specifically set forth in the Claims Notice shall survive until such time as
such claim is finally resolved.

 

10.2 _Indemnification by the Securityholders; Indemnification by the Parent_

 

(a) Subject to the other limitations set forth in this _Article X_ , from and
after the Closing Date, each Securityholder hereby agrees, severally (and not
jointly or jointly and severally) to indemnify and hold harmless the Parent,
its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees,
shareholders, partners, and members (each, a " _Parent Indemnitee_ ") from and
against any and all losses, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), claims, suits, actions and damages (collectively, " _Losses_
") arising from, or in connection with, any (i) breach of any of the
Securityholder Representations made by such Securityholder, (ii) breach of any
covenant or agreement made hereunder by the Securityholders (a "
_Securityholder Covenant_ "), (iii) breach of any covenant or agreement made
hereunder by the Company (solely with respect to covenants and agreements to
be made or performed by the Company prior to the Closing) (the " _Company
Covenants_ "), (iv) breach of any of the Company Representations, and (v)
Taxes which are, to the actual knowledge of the individuals set forth on
_Schedule 10.2_ , due and payable as of the Closing Date and which (1) have
not been paid by the Company (or on its behalf) or accrued for by the Company
in its financial statements, (2) are not being contested in

 


  

 

71

  

 



 

good faith or, if being contested in good faith, are not disclosed on the
_Schedules_ as being, or (3) are not disclosed by the Company either in the
_Schedules_ of the Company delivered hereunder or in any other written
statement provided by the Company to the Parent (any such Taxes meeting such
qualifications being herein referred to as " _Liability Taxes_ ").

 

(b) Subject to the other limitations set forth in this _Article X_ , the
Parent hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Securityholders, each
of such Securityholders respective Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, shareholders, partners and members, and prior to the Closing, the
Company and any Company Subsidiary and their respective officers, directors
and employees (each, a " _Securityholder Indemnitee_ " and together with the
Parent Indemnitees, the " _Indemnitees_ " and each an " _Indemnitee_ "), from
and against any Losses arising from or in connection with (i) the breach of
any representation or warranty of the Parent or the Merger Subs in this
Agreement and (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement made by the Parent
or the Merger Subs in this Agreement.

 

10.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall (i) the cumulative indemnification obligations of the Securityholders
under _Section 10.2(a)_ , on the one hand, or the Parent under _Section
10.2(b)_ , on the other hand, in the aggregate exceed an amount equal to the
Escrow Amount (the " _Total Cap_ "); provided, however, that the limitation
contemplated by this _Section 10.3(a)_ will not be applicable to (1) breaches
of the Specified Representations, (2) breaches of the covenants set forth in
_Section 6.1(b)(iv)_ , _Section 6.1(b)(xii)_ , _Section _6.1(b)(xiii)__ ,
_Section _6.1(b)(xiv)__ and _Section 6.22_ (Restrictive Covenants) and (3)
any Liability Taxes (clauses (1), (2) and (3), collectively the "
_Unrestricted Claims_ ") and (ii) the aggregate amount of Losses paid by any
Securityholder pursuant to _Section 10.2(a)_ exceed the amount of merger
consideration actually received by such Securityholder pursuant to _Article
II_ of this Agreement with respect to its Company Capital Stock.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
indemnification claims for Losses shall be asserted by the Securityholder
Indemnitees or the Parent Indemnitees, respectively, under _Article X_ for
breaches of representations and warranties unless (i) any individual Loss or
group or series of related Losses exceed $50,000 (such Loss or group or series
of related Losses that does not exceed $50,000, the " _DeMinimis Losses_ "),
and (ii) the aggregate amount of Losses that would otherwise be payable under
_Section 10.2(a)_ and _Section 10.2(b)_ , respectively (which shall not
include for such purposes DeMinimis Losses), exceed an amount equal to
$3,000,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), whereupon the Securityholder Indemnitee
or the Parent Indemnitee, as the case may be, shall be entitled to receive
only amounts for Losses in excess of the Basket Amount up to the Total Cap,
except as set forth in _Section 10.3(a)_.

 

(c) The cumulative indemnification obligations of the Securityholders under
_Section 10.2(a)_ (other than as set forth in _Section 10.3(a)_ ) shall be
recoverable solely from the Escrow Amount. The Parent agrees and acknowledges
on behalf of itself and the Parent Indemnitees, that, except as set forth in
_Section 10.3(a)_ , a Parent Indemnitee may only assert any claim for
indemnification under _Article X_ against the then available Escrow Amount in

 


  

 

72

  

 



 

accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The Parent agrees and
acknowledges on behalf of itself and the Parent Indemnitees, that: (i) a
Parent Indemnitee must first assert any claim for indemnification under
_Article X_ against the then available Escrow Amount in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement and (ii) if the amount recoverable by a Parent
Indemnitee in respect of a breach of a Securityholder Representation,
Securityholder Covenant, Company Representation or Company Covenant, in each
case with respect to any Unrestricted Claim, exceeds the amount of the then
available Escrow Amount or if the Escrow Agreement has terminated pursuant to
its terms, then (A) a Parent Indemnitee shall assert such claim solely against
that Securityholder who is in breach of the Unrestricted Claim, and no other
Securityholder shall have any liability with respect to such Unrestricted
Claim, and (B) in the case of an Unrestricted Claim that is a Company
Representation or a Company Covenant, against the Securityholders on a several
basis (and not on a joint or joint and several basis), for each such
Securityholders Escrow Pro Rata Percentage of the amount of Losses not
recovered by such Parent Indemnitee from the then available Escrow Amount.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the limitations
on the indemnification obligations of the parties hereto shall not apply to
claims based on fraud or intentional breaches of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation. Under no circumstances shall any Indemnitee be
entitled to be indemnified for special, consequential or punitive damages,
including multiple of earnings or profits theory, business interruptions, or
loss of business opportunity or reputation damages. The party seeking
indemnification under this _Article X_ shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any Loss which forms the basis of an indemnification claim
hereunder.

 

(e) No party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other Person with
respect to (i) any representation, warranty, covenant or condition
specifically waived in writing by the other party on or prior to the Closing,
and (ii) for any Losses for which a Claims Notice was not duly delivered prior
to the applicable Cut-Off Date.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
representations and warranties of the Company and the Securityholders
contained herein shall not be affected by any investigation conducted for or
on behalf of, or any knowledge possessed or acquired at any time by, the
Parent or its Affiliates, employees, or representatives concerning any
circumstance, action, omission or event relating to the accuracy or
performance of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation with
respect thereto

 

10.4 _Indemnification Claim Process_

 

(a) All claims for indemnification by either a Securityholder Indemnitee or a
Parent Indemnitee under this _Article X_ shall be asserted and resolved in
accordance with _Sections 10.4_ and _Sections 10.5_.

 

(b) If a Parent Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification pursuant to this
_Article X_ , the Parent Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Securityholders
Representative in writing of such claim, describing such claim in reasonable
detail and the amount or estimated amount of such Losses (the " _Claims
Notice_ "); _provided_ , that, subject to _Section 10.3(e)_ , the failure of
the Parent Indemnitee to promptly notify the Securityholders Representative
shall not relieve the Securityholders from liability for such claims except
and only to the extent that the Securityholders were actually prejudiced by
such delay.

 


  

 

73

  

 



 

(c) If a Securityholder Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification pursuant to
this _Article X_ , the Securityholder Indemnitee shall promptly deliver a
Claims Notice to the Parent; _provided_ , that, subject to _Section 10.3(e)_ ,
the failure of a Securityholder Indemnitee to promptly notify the Parent shall
not relieve the Parent from liability for such claims except and only to the
extent that the Securityholders were actually prejudiced by such delay.

 

(d) An Indemnitor shall have twenty-five (25) calendar days or such shorter
period as shall be required in order to respond to any Third Party Claim from
the date on which such Indemnitor received a Claims Notice with respect to a
Third Party (the " _Response Period_ ") to notify the Indemnitee in writing
that the Indemnitor desires to assume the defense or prosecution of such Third
Party Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom with counsel of its choice.

 

(i) In the event that the Indemnitor (A) notifies the Indemnitee in writing of
the Indemnitors intention to assume such defense and (B) provides the
Indemnitee with an Acknowledgement of Liability Certificate, (1) the
Indemnitor shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof,
and (2) the Indemnitor shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitee (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) unless the judgment or settlement provides solely for the
payment of money for which the Indemnitor is fully liable, the Indemnitor
makes such payment (subject to the applicable limitations contained herein)
and the Indemnitee receives an unconditional release; _provided_ , that the
Indemnitee may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and
participate in (but not control), the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

(ii) In the event that (A) the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee in writing
of the Indemnitors intention to assume such defense and (B) the Indemnitor
does not provide the Indemnitee with an Acknowledgement of Liability
Certificate, (1) then the Indemnitor shall control the investigation, defense
and settlement thereof and (2) the Indemnitor shall not consent to the entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the judgment or settlement
provides solely for the payment of money for which the Indemnitor is fully
liable, the Indemnitor makes such payment (subject to the applicable
limitations contained herein) and the Indemnitee receives an unconditional
release; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnitee may retain separate co-
counsel at its sole cost and expense and shall have joint control over the
investigation, defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Indemnitee shall not consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Indemnitor is determined to be liable pursuant to the terms hereof for such
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnitor shall reimburse the Indemnitee for
reasonable costs and expenses of such separate co-counsel.

 


  

 

74

  

 



 

(iii) In the event that the Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnitee in
writing of the Indemnitors intention to assume such defense, Indemnitee shall
control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof, and the Indemnitor
will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder with respect to
any settlement entered into or any judgment consented to without the
Indemnitors prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) with respect to any such Third Party Claim for which the
Indemnitor has provided to the Indemnitee an Acknowledgement of Liability
Certificate; _provided_ , that, if the Indemnitor does not provide the
Indemnitee with an Acknowledgement of Liability Certificate, the Indemnitee
may enter into any settlement of, or consent to judgment with respect to any
such Third Party Claim without waiving or otherwise adversely affecting any
rights hereunder.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties shall
act in good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise
dealing with Third Party Claims, and cooperate in any such defense and give
each other reasonable access to all information relevant thereto.

 

(e) Subject to the provisions of _Section 10.4(d)(i)_ and _Section
10.4(d)(ii)_ , if the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim within the Response Period, the Indemnitee will be entitled to
assume such defense, at its sole cost and expense upon delivery of notice to
such effect to the Indemnitor at any time after such Response Period.

 

(f) The Parent Indemnitee shall, and shall cause the Company and each Company
Subsidiary to, provide reasonable cooperation with the Securityholders
Representative in all aspects of any investigation, defense, pretrial
activities, trial, compromise, settlement or discharge of any claim in respect
of which a Parent Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to this
_Article X_ that the Securityholders Representative has elected to control,
including, but not limited to, by providing the Securityholders
Representative with reasonable access to books, records, employees and
officers (including as witnesses) of the Company and each Company Subsidiary.

 

10.5 _Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims_. The Indemnitee
will deliver a Claims Notice to the Indemnitor promptly upon its discovery of
any matter for which the Indemnitor may be liable to the Indemnitee hereunder
that does not involve a Third Party Claim, which Claims Notice shall also (a)
state that the Indemnitee has paid or properly accrued Losses or anticipates
that it will incur liability for Losses for which such Indemnitee is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, and (b) the date such item was
paid or accrued; _provided_ , that, subject to _Section 10.3(e)_ , the failure
of the Indemnitee to promptly notify Indemnitor shall not relieve the
Indemnitor from liability for such claims except and only to the extent that
the Indemnitor was actually prejudiced by such delay. The Indemnitee shall
reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnitor in determining the validity of
any claim for indemnity by the Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving such
matters. Such assistance and cooperation shall include providing reasonable
access to and copies of information, records and documents relating to such
matters, furnishing employees to assist in the investigation, defense and
resolution of such matters and providing legal and business assistance with
respect to such matters.

 


  

 

75

  

 



 

10.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
except in the case of fraud or intentional breaches, the indemnification
provisions of _Article X_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of parties
following the Closing for any and all breaches or alleged breaches of any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties, or any
other provision of this Agreement or with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and the Parties hereby waive and release any right or
remedy, including indemnification, cost recovery and contribution, available
under common law, Environmental Law or any other Law with regard to such
claims and with respect to the Owned Real Property and the Leased Real
Property.

 

10.7 _Tax; Insurance; Other Indemnification_. The amount of any Losses
suffered by an Indemnitee shall be reduced by any tax benefit to the extent
utilized, any insurance, or any other payments actually received pursuant to
any other existing indemnification arrangements. From and after the Closing
Date, the Parent shall pursue any and all other commercially reasonable
remedies to collect any indemnification or other amounts pursuant to any other
existing indemnification arrangements covering the Loss that is the subject of
the claim for indemnification hereunder to the extent that the Parent
determines in good faith that indemnification is available under any other
indemnification arrangements. If any such proceeds, benefits or recoveries
are actually received by the Parent with respect to any Losses after the
Parent has received indemnification proceeds hereunder, the Parent shall
promptly, but, in any event, no later than ten (10) Business Days after the
receipt or recovery of such proceeds or recoveries, pay to the applicable
Securityholders, in accordance with such percentage as the Securityholders
Representative shall direct, an amount equal to the lesser of the (x) amount
of such recovery proceeds or benefits actually received in respect of such
claim and (y) the amount of indemnification Losses the Parent received from
the Securityholders in respect of such claim.

 

10.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. It is the intention of the
parties to treat any indemnity payment made under this Agreement as an
adjustment to the purchase price for all federal, state, local and foreign Tax
purposes, and the parties agree to file their Tax Returns accordingly.

long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto.
Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.

 Pursuant to Sections 242 and 245 of the

ENTERPRISE ACQUISITION CORP., a corporation existing under the laws of the
State of Delaware (the " _Corporation_ "), by its Chief Executive Officer,
hereby certifies as follows:

 

1\. The name of the Corporation is "Enterprise Acquisition Corp."

 

2\. The Corporations original Certificate of Incorporation was filed in the
office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on July 6, 2007.
The Corporations Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on November 13, 2007.

 

3\. This Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended from
time to time, the " _Certificate_ ") restates, integrates and further amends
the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation.

 

4\. This Certificate was duly adopted in accordance with the applicable
provisions of Sections 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (" _DGCL_ ") and has been approved by the holders of a majority of
the issued and outstanding shares of the Corporation in accordance with
Section 228 of the DGCL.

 

5\. The text of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
Corporation is hereby amended and restated to read in full as follows:

 

 _ARTICLE ONE_

 

The name of the corporation is Workflow Corporation (hereinafter sometimes
referred to as the " _Corporation_ ").

 

 _ARTICLE TWO_

 

The registered office of the Corporation is located at the Corporation Trust
Company, 1209 Orange Street, in the City of Wilmington, County of New Castle,
19801. The name of its registered agent at that address is the Corporation
Trust Company.

 

 _ARTICLE THREE_

 

The purpose of the Corporation shall be to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the DGCL.

 


  

 

A-1

  _ARTICLE FOUR_

 

The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock which the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is 155,000,000 of which 150,000,000
shares shall be Common Stock of the par value of $.0001 per share (the "
_Common Stock_ ") and 5,000,000 shares shall be Preferred Stock of the par
value of $.0001 per share (the " _Preferred Stock_ ").

 

A. _Preferred Stock_. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in
one or more series. The Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Corporation
is hereby expressly granted authority to provide, from time to time, for the
issuance of shares of the Preferred Stock, in one or more series, and, in
connection with the creation of any such series, by resolution or resolutions
providing for the issue of the shares thereof, to determine and fix for each
such series such powers (including voting powers, full or limited, or no
voting powers), and such designations, preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights and such qualifications,
limitations or restrictions thereof, including, without limitation thereof,
dividend rights, special voting rights, conversion rights, redemption
privileges and liquidation preferences, as shall be stated and expressed in
the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board providing for the issue of
such series, all to the full extent now or hereafter permitted by the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to the rights of
any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, the resolution or resolutions
providing for issuance of any series of Preferred Stock may provide that such
series shall be superior, rank equally or be junior to the Preferred Stock of
any other series to the extent permitted by law.

 

B. The number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock may be increased or
decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all of
the then outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Corporation entitled
to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class, without a separate vote of the holders of the Preferred Stock, or any
series thereof, unless a vote of any such holders is required by the express
terms of any series of Preferred Stock as provided for or fixed pursuant to
the provisions of Section A. of Article FOUR hereof.

 

C. _Common Stock_. Except as otherwise required by law or as otherwise
provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of Section A. of Article FOUR
hereof, the holders of the Common Stock shall exclusively possess all voting
power of the Corporation and each outstanding share of Common Stock shall
entitle the holder thereof to one vote (and not more than one vote) on each
matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of holders of the Common Stock;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of
Common Stock, as such, shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment to this
Certificate that relates solely to the terms, number of shares, powers,
designations, preferences, or relative, participating, optional or other
special rights (including, without limitation, voting rights), or to
qualifications, limitations, or restrictions thereon, of one or more
outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series
are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one more other
such series, to vote thereon pursuant to this Certificate, as amended from
time to time (including, without limitation, by any certificate of
designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) or pursuant to the
DGCL.

 


  

 

A-2

  _ARTICLE FIVE_

 

The following provisions are inserted for the management of the business and
for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and for further definition,
limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of its
directors and stockholders:

 

A. Election of directors need not be by ballot unless the by-laws of the
Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ ") so provide.

 

B. Subject to any additional vote required by this Certificate, the Board is
expressly authorized, without the consent or vote of the stockholders, to
make, adopt, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the Bylaws as provided in
the Bylaws.

 

C. Except as otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of
Section A. of Article FOUR hereof relating to the rights of the holders of any
one or more series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors, the total
number of directors constituting the entire Board shall be not more than 11,
with the then-authorized number of directors being fixed from time to time by
the Board. The Board, other than those directors elected by the holders of
any one or more series of Preferred Stock as provided for or fixed pursuant to
the provisions of Section A. of Article FOUR hereof, shall be divided into
three classes: Class A, Class B and Class C, with the term of office of one
class expiring each year. The number of directors in each class shall be as
nearly equal as possible. The directors in Class A shall be initially elected
for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders held in 2009, the
directors in Class B shall be initially elected for a term expiring at the
annual meeting of stockholders held in 2010 and the directors in Class C shall
be initially elected for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders
held in 2011. Directors in each class shall hold office until the annual
meeting for the year in which their term expires and until their successors
are elected and qualified, subject, however, to prior death, resignation,
retirement, or removal from office. Commencing at the first annual meeting of
stockholders, and at each annual meeting thereafter, directors elected to
succeed those directors whose terms expire shall be elected in accordance with
this Section C. of this Article FIVE for a term of office to expire at the
third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election. In the
event of any increase or decrease in the authorized number of directors, (i)
each director then serving as such shall nevertheless continue as a director
of the class of which he or she is a member until the expiration of such
directors current term or his or her prior death, resignation, retirement, or
removal from office, and (ii) the newly created or eliminated directorships
resulting from such increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board
among the three classes of directors so that the number of directors in each
class is as nearly equal as possible. To the extent possible, consistent with
the foregoing rule, any newly created directorships shall be added to those
classes whose terms of office are to expire at the earliest dates following
such allocation, unless otherwise provided for from time to time by resolution
adopted by a majority of the directors then in office, though less than a
quorum. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the whole Board
shall shorten the term of an incumbent director. Except as the DGCL may
otherwise require and as otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the
provisions of Section A. of Article FOUR hereof relating to the rights of the
holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock to elect additional
directors and fill vacancies with respect to such additional directorships,
newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized
number of directors and any vacancies in the Board resulting

 


  

 

A-3

  from death, resignation, retirement, or removal from office or other cause,
including vacancies resulting from the removal of directors for cause, shall
be filled solely by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining
directors then in office, even though less than a quorum (as defined in the
Bylaws), or by the sole remaining director. Any director so chosen shall hold
office until the next election of the class for which such director shall have
been chosen and until his or her successor shall be elected and qualified.
Except as otherwise provided for or fixed pursuant to the provisions of
Section A. of Article FOUR hereof relating to the rights of the holders of any
one or more series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors and remove
such directors, any director, or the entire Board, may be removed from office
at any time, but only for cause.

 

 _ARTICLE SIX_

 

A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the
Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary
duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors
duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a
knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any
transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If
the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or
limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director
of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this
Article SIX by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect
any right or protection of a director of the Corporation with respect to
events occurring prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

 

 _ARTICLE SEVEN_

 

A. _Indemnification_. (1) Subject to Section C of this Article SEVEN, the
Corporation shall indemnify, to the full extent that it shall have power under
applicable law to do so and in a manner permitted by such law, any person who
is made or threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (as a
witness or otherwise) in any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit,
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative (a
"Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation, or while serving as a director or officer of the
Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including service with respect to
an employee benefit plan (collectively, "Another Enterprise"), against
expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines (including ERISA excise
taxes or penalties) and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by him or her in connection with such Proceeding if he or she acted
in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her
conduct was unlawful.

 

(2) The Corporation may indemnify, to the full extent that it shall have power
under applicable law to do so and in a manner permitted by such law, any
person who is made or threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise
involved (as a witness or otherwise) in any threatened, pending, or completed
Proceeding, by reason of the fact that such person is or was an employee or
agent of the Corporation, or while not serving as a director or officer of the

 


  

 

A-4

  Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee, or agent of Another Enterprise, against expenses
(including attorneys fees), judgments, fines (including ERISA excise taxes or
penalties) and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by
him or her in connection with such Proceeding if he or she acted in good faith
and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was
unlawful.

 

(3) To the extent that a present or former director or officer of the
Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any
threatened, pending, or completed Proceeding referred to in Section 145(a) or
(b) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or in defense of
any claim, issue, or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against
expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him
or her in connection therewith.

 

(4) The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendre or its equivalent, shall not, of
itself, create a presumption that the person seeking indemnification did not
act in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or
not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her
conduct was unlawful.

 

B. _Advancement of Expenses_. (1) Subject to Section C of this Article SEVEN,
with respect to any person who is made or threatened to be made a party to or
is otherwise involved (as a witness or otherwise) in any threatened, pending,
or completed Proceeding, by reason of the fact that such person is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation or while serving as a director or
officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of Another Enterprise,
the Corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by
such person in defending any such Proceeding in advance of its final
disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); _provided_ , _however_
, that any advancement of expenses shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking") by such person to repay all amounts
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from
which there is no further right to appeal that such person is not entitled to
be indemnified for such expenses under this Article SEVEN or otherwise.

 

(2) With respect to any person who is made or threatened to be made a party to
or is otherwise involved (as a witness or otherwise) in any threatened,
pending, or completed Proceeding, by reason of the fact that such person is or
was an employee or agent of the Corporation, or while not serving as a
director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of Another
Enterprise, the Corporation may, in its discretion and upon such terms and
conditions, if any, as the Corporation deems appropriate, pay the expenses
(including attorneys fees) incurred by such person in defending any such
Proceeding in advance of its final disposition.

 

C. _Actions Initiated Against The Corporation_. Anything in Section A(1) or
Section B(1) of this Article SEVEN to the contrary notwithstanding, except as
provided in

 


  

 

A-5

  Section E(2) of this Article SEVEN, with respect to a Proceeding initiated
against the Corporation by a person who is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation (whether initiated by such person in or by reason of such capacity
or in or by reason of any other capacity, including as a director, officer,
employee, or agent of Another Enterprise), the Corporation shall not be
required to indemnify or to advance expenses (including attorneys fees) to
such person in connection with prosecuting such Proceeding (or part thereof)
or in defending any counterclaim, cross-claim, affirmative defense, or like
claim of the Corporation in such Proceeding (or part thereof) unless such
Proceeding was authorized by the Board.

 

D. _Contract Rights_. The rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses conferred upon any current or former director or officer of the
Corporation pursuant to this Article SEVEN (whether by reason of the fact that
such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or while
serving as a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of
Another Enterprise) shall be contract rights, shall vest when such person
becomes a director or officer of the Corporation, and shall continue as vested
contract rights even if such person ceases to be a director or officer of the
Corporation. Any amendment, repeal, or modification of, or adoption of any
provision inconsistent with, this Article SEVEN (or any provision hereof)
shall not adversely affect any right to indemnification or advancement of
expenses granted to any person pursuant hereto with respect to any act or
omission of such person occurring prior to the time of such amendment, repeal,
modification, or adoption (regardless of whether the Proceeding relating to
such acts or omissions, or any proceeding relating to such persons rights to
indemnification or to advancement of expenses, is commenced before or after
the time of such amendment, repeal, modification, or adoption), and any such
amendment, repeal, modification, or adoption that would adversely affect such
persons rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses hereunder shall
be ineffective as to such person, except with respect to any Proceeding that
relates to or arises from (and only to the extent such Proceeding relates to
or arises from) any act or omission of such person occurring after the
effective time of such amendment, repeal, modification, or adoption.

 

E. _Claims_. (1) If (X) a claim under Section A(1) of this Article SEVEN with
respect to any right to indemnification is not paid in full by the Corporation
(following the final disposition of any Proceeding) within sixty days after a
written demand has been received by the Corporation or (Y) a claim under
Section B(1) of this Article SEVEN with respect to any right to the
advancement of expenses is not paid in full by the Corporation within twenty
days after a written demand has been received by the Corporation, then the
person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of
expenses, as the case may be, may at any time thereafter bring suit against
the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim.

 

(2) If successful in whole or in part in any suit brought pursuant to Section
E(1) of this Article SEVEN, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover
an advancement of expenses (whether pursuant to the terms of an undertaking or
otherwise), the person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification or an
advancement of expenses hereunder or the person from whom the Corporation
sought to recover an advancement of expenses, as the case may be, shall be
entitled to be paid by the Corporation the reasonable expenses (including
attorneys fees) of prosecuting or defending such suit.

 


  

 

A-6

  (3) In any suit brought by a person seeking to enforce a right to
indemnification hereunder (but not a suit brought by a person seeking to
enforce a right to an advancement of expenses hereunder), it shall be a
defense that the person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification has not
met any applicable standard for indemnification under applicable law. With
respect to any suit brought by a person seeking to enforce a right to
indemnification or right to advancement of expenses hereunder or any suit
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses (whether
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking or otherwise), neither (i) the failure
of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to commencement of such
suit that indemnification of such person is proper in the circumstances
because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct under
applicable law, nor (ii) an actual determination by the Corporation that such
person has not met such applicable standards of conduct, shall create a
presumption that such person has not met the applicable standards of conduct
or, in a case brought by such person seeking to enforce a right to
indemnification, be a defense to such suit.

 

(4) In any suit brought by a person seeking to enforce a right to
indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the
Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses (whether pursuant to the
terms of an undertaking or otherwise), the burden shall be on the Corporation
to prove that the person seeking to enforce a right to indemnification or to
an advancement of expenses or the person from whom the Corporation seeks to
recover an advancement of expenses is not entitled to be indemnified, or to
such an advancement of expenses, under this Article SEVEN or otherwise.

 

F. _Determination of Entitlement to Indemnification_. Any indemnification
required or permitted under this Article SEVEN (unless ordered by a court)
shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon
a determination that indemnification of the present or former director,
officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she
has met all applicable standards of conduct set forth in this Article SEVEN
and Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Such
determination shall be made, with respect to a person who is a director or
officer of the Corporation at the time of such determination, (i) by a
majority vote of the directors who are not parties to such action, suit or
proceeding, even though less than a quorum; (ii) by a committee of such
directors designated by majority vote of such directors, even though less than
a quorum; (iii) if there are no such directors, or if such directors so
direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion; or (iv) by the
stockholders. Such determination shall be made, with respect to any person
who is not a director or officer of the Corporation at the time of such
determination, in the manner determined by the Board (including in such manner
as may be set forth in any general or specific action of the Board applicable
to indemnification claims by such person) or in the manner set forth in any
agreement to which such person and the Corporation are parties.

 

G. _Non-Exclusive Rights_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided in this Article SEVEN shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which any person may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in
such persons official capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be
such director, officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of
the heirs, executors, and administrators of such person.

 


  

 

A-7

  H. _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf
of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee, or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee, or agent of Another Enterprise against any
liability asserted against such person and incurred by such person in any such
capacity, or arising out of such persons status as such, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
liability under the provisions of this Article SEVEN or otherwise.

 

I. _Severability_. If any provision or provisions of this Article SEVEN shall
be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever:
(1) the validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of
this Article SEVEN (including, without limitation, each portion of any
paragraph or clause containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal,
or unenforceable, that is not itself held to be invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (2)
to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article SEVEN
(including, without limitation, each such portion of any paragraph or clause
containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable)
shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the
provision held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable.

 

J. _Miscellaneous_. For purposes of this Article SEVEN: (a) references to
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of Another
Enterprise shall include any service as a director or officer of the
Corporation that imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or
officer with respect to an employee benefit plan; (b) references to serving at
the request of the Corporation as a employee or agent of Another Enterprise
shall include any service as an employee or agent of the Corporation that
imposes duties on, or involves services by, such employee or agent with
respect to an employee benefit plan; (c) a person who acted in good faith and
in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to
have acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation;
and (d) references to a director of Another Enterprise shall include, in the
case of any entity that is not managed by a board of directors, such other
position, such as manager or trustee or member of the governing body of such
entity, that entails responsibility for the management and direction of such
entitys affairs, including, without limitation, general partner of any
partnership (general or limited) and manager or managing member of any limited
liability company.

 

 _ARTICLE EIGHT_

 

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this Certificate, in the manner now or hereafter
prescribed by this Certificate and the DGCL; and, except as set forth in
Articles SIX and SEVEN, all rights, preferences and privileges herein
conferred upon stockholders, directors or any other persons by and pursuant to
this Certificate in its present form or as hereafter amended are granted
subject to the right reserved in this Article EIGHT.

 

 _ARTICLE NINE_

 

The Corporation hereby elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL.

FORM OF ESCROW AGREEMENT

 

This ESCROW AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of _________, 2008, by
and among Enterprise Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "),
Perseus, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Securityholders
 Representative_") and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., (the " _Escrow Agent_ ,"
and together with Parent and the Securityholders Representative, the "
_Parties_ "). Capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise defined
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

 

WHEREAS, Parent, the Securityholders Representative and certain other
entities are parties to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August
__, 2008 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), which such Merger Agreement
contemplates the establishment of an escrow fund as the recourse for any
indemnity claims of the Parent Indemnitees made pursuant to _Article X_ of the
Merger Agreement.

 

WHEREAS, Parent and the Securityholders Representative are desirous of having
the Escrow Agent serve as the escrow agent for the Escrow Fund, and the Escrow
Agent is desirous of serving in such capacity, in accordance with the terms
and conditions contained herein.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual premises set forth herein, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

 

1. _Establishment and Termination of Escrow_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent is delivering and the Securityholders shall be deemed to have delivered, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, [_______] shares (the " _Escrow Fund_ " and, as such amount is adjusted as a result of distributions to Parent from time to time pursuant to Section 2.A., the " _Adjusted_ _Escrow Fund_ ") of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, of the Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ "), to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent hereby accepts and agrees to hold said Parent Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth hereinafter. Each Securityholder shall be deemed to have deposited into escrow such Securityholders Escrow Pro Rata Percentage of the Escrow Fund and such shares shall be deducted from the shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise deliverable to such Securityholder pursuant to Section 2.7 of the Merger Agreement. The Securityholders shall retain all of their rights as stockholders of the Parent with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the Escrow Fund, and shall be entitled to receive dividends on and to vote such shares of Parent Common Stock. Dividends will be paid directly to the Securityholders. This Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the release of all shares from the Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 

2. _Release of Shares_. The Parent Common Stock shall be released as follows: 

 

A. _Distributions to Parent_. If at any time, and from time to time, Parent
advises the Escrow Agent pursuant to a Claims Notice according to _Article X_
of the Merger Agreement, with a copy delivered simultaneously to the
Securityholders Representative, (a) that Parent is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _Article X_ of the Merger Agreement and (b) the
amount of indemnification due (the " _Indemnity Amount_ "), then the Escrow
Agent shall, within

 


  

 

B-1

  

 



 



 

thirty Business Days after the date of receipt of the written notice from
Parent, deliver the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to Parent (or any
persons designated in writing by Parent) from the Escrow Fund. Parent will
include in the written notice the number of shares to be disbursed, determined
as the quotient of (i) the Indemnity Amount _divided_ _by_ (ii) the Assumed
Value, _unless_ the Escrow Agent shall have received, within fifteen Business
Days after the date the Escrow Agent received such written notice from Parent,
a written objection from the Securityholders Representative to such delivery
setting forth the amount in dispute with respect to such Claims Notice (the "
_Disputed Amount_ "), in which case the Escrow Agent shall deliver that number
of shares, as instructed by the Securityholders Representative, if any, that,
when _multiplied_ _by_ the Assumed Value, equals the amount not in dispute
with respect to such Claims Notice (the " _Undisputed Amount_ ") to Parent (or
its designee) and shall continue to hold the shares with respect to the
Disputed Amount until either (a) receipt of a certificate signed by Parent and
the Securityholders Representative (1) directing the Escrow Agent to deliver
that number of shares to Parent (or its designee) that, when _multiplied_ _by_
the Assumed Value, equals all or a portion of the Disputed Amount and (2)
acknowledging that such delivery by the Escrow Agent to Parent (or its
designee) shall satisfy and discharge any remaining claims of Parent
Indemnitees with respect to the related Claims Certificate or (b) receipt of a
final nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction directing
the Escrow Agent to deliver to Parent (or its designee) that number of shares
that, when _multiplied_ _by_ the Assumed Value, equals all or a portion of the
Disputed Amount.

 

B. _Distributions to the Securityholders  Representative_.

 

(i) _Step-down Payment_. On the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the "
_Step-down Payment Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall deliver to each
Securityholder such Securityholders Escrow Pro Rata Percentage of that number
of shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, equal to the quotient of (i) the
Step-down Payment Amount _divided_ _by_ (ii) the Assumed Value, upon written
instructions from the Securityholders Representative which shall set forth
such number of shares to be released. For purposes of this Agreement, the "
_Step-down_ _Payment Amount_ " shall mean (a) in the event that the difference
between (1) the Adjusted Escrow Fund and (2) the total dollar amount of all
unresolved claims of the Parent Indemnitees against the Securityholders as of
the Step-Down Payment Date timely submitted pursuant to _Article X_ of the
Merger Agreement (such amount, the " _Aggregate Unresolved Claims_ ") is

difference between (1) the Adjusted Escrow Fund and (2) the Aggregate
Unresolved Claims is a positive amount less than $7,143,000, such positive

Escrow Fund and (2) the Aggregate Unresolved Claims is less than or equal to

(ii) _Termination of the Escrow Fund_. On the date that is fifteen (15)

shares of Parent Common Stock remaining in the Escrow Fund shall be delivered
to the Securityholders _provided_ _that_ all claims made by Parent pursuant to
_Article X_ of the Merger Agreement have been resolved pursuant to the process
set forth in Section 2.A, and _further_ _provided_ , that, to the extent that
any claims made by Parent pursuant to _Article X_ of the Merger Agreement have
not been resolved pursuant to the process set forth in Section 2.A, then only
such amount of Parent Common Stock shall be released from the Escrow Fund at
such time as is not a Disputed Amount with respect to any outstanding claims
of Parent. Upon resolution of all claims made by

 


  

 

B-2

  

 



 



 

Parent pursuant to _Article X_ of the Merger Agreement, the remaining shares,
if any, in the Escrow Fund shall be delivered to the Securityholders.

 

C. _Distributions by the Escrow Agent_. All distributions of Parent Common
Stock from the Escrow Fund to the Securityholders or the Parent shall be in
accordance with each Securityholders Escrow Pro Rata Percentage.

 

3. _Rights, Duties and Responsibilities of Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly set forth herein. It is understood that the Escrow Agent is not a trustee or fiduciary and is acting hereunder merely in a ministerial capacity and it is further agreed by the Parties that the Escrow Agents only responsibility is to follow the signed written instructions received from Parent and the Securityholders Representative. The Escrow Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of, nor have any requirements to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument or document between the Parties, in connection herewith, if any, including without limitation the Merger Agreement   (the "   _  Underlying Agreement  _   ")  , nor shall the Escrow Agent be required to determine if any person or entity has complied with any such agreements, nor shall any additional obligations of the Escrow Agent be inferred from the terms of such agreements, even though reference thereto may be made in this Escrow Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms and provisions of this Agreement, those of the  Underlying Agreement    ,    any schedule or exhibit attached to the Agreement,   or any other agreement among the Parties, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Parties further agree that:

 

A. During the term of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall vote the Parent
Common Stock as directed by the Securityholders Representative.

 

B. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for the performance by any party
of its respective obligations under the Merger Agreement.

 

C. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it
without gross negligence or willful misconduct and in the exercise of its own
best judgment, and may rely conclusively and shall be protected in acting upon
any order, notice, demand, certificate, opinion or advice of counsel
(including counsel chosen by the Escrow Agent), statement, instrument, report
or other paper or document (not only as to its due execution and the validity
and effectiveness of its provisions, but also as to the truth and
acceptability of any information therein contained) which is reasonably
believed by the Escrow Agent to be genuine and to be signed or presented by
the proper person or persons. The Escrow Agent shall not be bound by any
notice or demand, or any waiver, modification, termination or rescission of
this Agreement unless evidenced by a writing delivered to the Escrow Agent
signed by the proper party or parties and, if the duties or rights of the
Escrow Agent are affected, unless it shall have given its prior written
consent thereto. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any payments
which may be due to it, including, without limitation, Escrow Fund or Adjusted
Escrow Fund nor shall the Escrow Agent have any duty or obligation to confirm
or verify the accuracy or correctness of any amounts deposited hereunder.

 


  

 

B-3

  

 



 



 

D. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or
omitted to be taken by it except to the extent that a final adjudication of a
court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Escrow Agent\'s gross
negligence or willful misconduct was the primary cause of any loss to either
Party. The Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and perform any of its
duties hereunder directly or through agents or attorneys, and shall be liable
for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by such agents or
attorneys, to the extent that a final adjudication of a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that such agents or attorneys gross negligence or
willful misconduct was the primary cause of any loss to either Party. The
Escrow Agent may consult with counsel, accountants and other skilled persons
to be selected and retained by it.

 

E. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or
rights hereunder or shall receive instructions with respect to the Parent
Common Stock, which, in its sole opinion, are in conflict with either other
instructions received by it or any provision of this Agreement, it shall be
entitled to hold the Parent Common Stock, in escrow, pending the resolution of
such uncertainty to the Escrow Agents sole satisfaction, by written
confirmation of an agreement between Parent and the Securityholders
Representative, or by final nonappealable judgment of a court or courts of
competent jurisdiction; or the Escrow Agent, at its option, may deposit the
Parent Common Stock, into the registry of a United States court of competent
jurisdiction in a proceeding to which all parties in interest are joined.
Except in the case of the Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful
misconduct, Parent and Securityholders Representative agree to pursue any
redress or recourse in connection with any dispute without making the Escrow
Agent a party to the same.

 

F. Anything in this Escrow Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no
event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, incidental, punitive,
indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but
not limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

 

4. _Amendment; Resignation_. a) This Agreement may be modified or amended only in writing and with the written consent of all of the Parties. The Escrow Agent may resign as Escrow Agent at any time upon five (5) days written notice to the other parties hereto. In the case of the Escrow Agents resignation, its only duty shall be to hold and dispose of the Parent Common Stock in accordance with the original provisions of this Agreement until a successor escrow agent shall be appointed and written notice of the name and address of such successor escrow agent shall be given to the Escrow Agent by Parent and the Securityholders Representative or in accordance with the directions of a final court order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction; whereupon the Escrow Agents only duty shall be to deliver to the successor escrow agent the shares of Parent Common Stock remaining in the Escrow Fund at such time. Upon delivery of the shares of the Parent Common Stock, Escrow Agents obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate, subject to the provisions of Sections 5 and 6 hereunder. Any successor escrow agent shall be appointed hereunder by the Securityholders Representative, subject to the approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld. If no new escrow agent is so appointed within the 60 day period following the giving of such notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent may deposit the Escrow Fund with any court in the Southern District of New York it deems reasonably appropriate.

 


  

 

B-4

  

 



 



 

B. Any entity into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any entity to which all or substantially all
the escrow business may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this
Escrow Agreement without further act.

 

5. _Compensation and Expenses_. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to reasonable compensation from Parent for all services rendered by it hereunder as per _Schedule A_ , attached hereto. The Escrow Agent shall be reimbursed by Parent for any and all reasonable expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement. Any expenses to be reimbursed hereunder shall be due and payable upon receipt of an invoice describing the same. 

 

6. _Indemnification_. Parent shall indemnify, defend and save harmless the Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their respective successors, assigns, directors, officers, managers, attorneys, accountants, experts, agents and employees (the " _indemnitees_ ") from and against, any and all losses, liabilities, claims, penalties, judgments, settlements, actions, suits, preceedings, litigation, investigations, costs, damages and expenses, (including, without limitation, reasonable legal counsel fees and court costs of experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively " _Losses_ ") arising out of or relating in any way with (a) the Escrow Agent\'s execution and performance of this Escrow Agreement, tax reporting or withholding, the enforcement of any rights or remedies under or in connection with this Escrow Agreement, or as may arise by reason of any act, omission or error of the indemnitee, except in the case of any indemnitee to the extent that such Losses are finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been primarily caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any indemnitee, or (b) its following any instructions or other directions, whether joint or singular, from Parent and Securityholders Representative (except to the extent that its following any such instruction or direction is expressly forbidden by the terms hereof) without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent or any indemnitee. The indemnification provisions herein shall survive the resignation, replacement or removal of the Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement.

 

7. _Miscellaneous_.

 

A. _No Waiver_. Neither the failure nor any delay on the part of either party
to exercise any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Agreement shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, remedy, power or privilege preclude any other or further exercise of
the same or of any other right, remedy, power or privilege, nor shall any
waiver of any right, remedy, power or privilege with respect to any occurrence
be construed as a waiver of such right, remedy, power or privilege with
respect to any other occurrence. No waiver shall be effective unless it is in
writing and is signed by the party asserted to have granted such waiver.

 

B. _Controlling Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the
State of New York, without application to the principals of conflicts of laws.

 

C. _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications
required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed to have been duly given, made and received only when personally
delivered, or the day received by certified

B-7

  

 



 



 

L. _Patriot Act Disclosure_. Section 326 of the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism Act of 2001 ("USA PATRIOT Act") requires the Escrow Agent to
implement reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any person that
opens a new account with it. Accordingly, Parent and Securityholders
Representative acknowledge that Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the
Escrow Agents identity verification procedures require the Escrow Agent to
obtain information which may be used to confirm Parent and Securityholders
Representatives identity including without limitation name, address and
organizational documents ("identifying information"). Parent and

taxes or for the preparation and/or filing of any tax return, information

hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with
all writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by
legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without
jurisdiction, and in the event that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with
any such writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any of the parties
hereto or to any other person, entity, firm or corporation, by reason of such
compliance notwithstanding such writ, order or decree be subsequently

or in any other manner permitted by applicable law and consents to the
jurisdiction of the courts located in the State of New York. The Parties
further hereby waive any right to a trial by jury with respect to any lawsuit
or judicial proceeding arising or relating to this Agreement. No Party is

or unenforceable by reason of any applicable law of a jurisdiction,

 


  

 

B-8

  

 



  

then such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions thereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in
such jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provisions
in any other jurisdiction. A person who is not a party to this Agreement shall
have no right to enforce any term of this Agreement. The Parties represent,
warrant and covenant that each document, notice, instruction or request
provided by such Party shall comply with applicable laws and regulations.
Where, however, the conflicting provisions of any such applicable law may be
waived, they are hereby irrevocably waived by the Parties to the fullest
extent permitted by law, to the end that this Escrow shall be enforced as
written. Except as expressly provided in Section 6 above, nothing in this
Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be construed to give to any
person or entity other than the Escrow Agent and Parent and Securityholders
Representative any legal or equitable right, remedy, interest or claim under
or in respect of this Agreement or any funds escrowed hereunder.

 

P. _Security Procedures_. In the event disbursement instructions are given,

anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated. Such
disbursement instructions shall be executed by an authorized signatory, a list
of such authorized signatories is set forth in Schedule 1. The person and
telephone numbers for call backs may be changed only in writing actually
received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. Securityholders
Representative acknowledges that these security procedures are commercially
reasonable.

The Workflow Corporation Cash Bonus Plan (" _Plan_ ") is an incentive plan for
eligible employees of Workflow Corporation (the " _Company_ ") and its
subsidiaries. The Plan provides cash-based incentive opportunities to
executives and other key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Payment of Cash Bonus Awards, if any, is conditioned on the achievement of one
or more of the Performance Goals set forth on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto and
the employees continued employment through the date the applicable
Performance Goal is achieved.

 

I. PURPOSE

 

The purpose of the Plan is to allow the Company to motivate and retain highly
qualified employees; to obtain from each employee the best possible
performance; to establish performance goals that support the Company\'s long-
term business strategies; and to provide consistency in and alignment with the
Company\'s overall executive compensation strategy.

 



 

II. DEFINITIONS

 

For purposes of the Plan, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:

 

A. BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The Board of Directors of the Company.

 

B. BONUS POOL. The bonus pool established for the payment of Cash Bonus
Awards hereunder which shall not exceed $50 million. 

 

C. BONUS POOL PERCENTAGE. A Participants allocated share of the Bonus Pool
as set forth on _Exhibit B_ attached hereto.

 

D. COMMITTEE. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or any
successor thereto. 

 

E. CASH BONUS AWARD. Any award made pursuant to the Plan.

 

F. PARTICIPANT. An executive or other key employee of the Company or one or
more of its subsidiaries, or a person who has agreed to commence serving in
any of such capacities, and who is designated by the Chief Executive Officer
as a participant in the Plan.

 

G. PERFORMANCE GOALS. The performance conditions set forth on _Exhibit A_
attached hereto which must be achieved in order for Cash Bonus Awards to be
paid hereunder.

 


  

 

E-1

  H. WARRANTS. The warrants issued pursuant to that certain Warrant Agreement
dated November 7, 2007 by and between Enterprise Acquisition Corp. and
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company that are outstanding as of the
Effective Date.

 

III. ELIGIBILITY

 

 Participants in the Plan shall be selected by the Chief Executive Officer from those executives and key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries whose efforts contribute materially to the success of the Company. No employee shall be a Participant unless he or she is selected by the Chief Executive Officer, in his sole discretion. No employee shall at any time have the right to be selected as a Participant.

 

IV. EFFECTIVE DATE

 

The Plan has been adopted by the Board of Directors effective as of _______,
2008.

 

V. BONUS POOL; DETERMINATION OF AMOUNTS; ELIGIBILITY FOR CASH BONUS
AWARDS

 

A. Each Participant shall be eligible to receive Cash Bonus Awards under the
Plan if (i) the Performance Goal(s) are attained and (ii) the Participant is
employed by the Company or a subsidiary on the date that the Performance
Goal(s) are attained.

 

B. Subject to Paragraph C. below, the amount of each Cash Bonus Award shall be
determined in accordance with the formulas set forth on _Exhibit A_ and the
Participants Bonus Pool Percentage set forth on _Exhibit B_.

 

C. The Chief Executive Officer shall determine the final amounts of all Cash
Bonus Awards to Participants; _provided_ , _that_ , the Chief Executive
Officer shall not determine the amount if his own award. The Chief Executive
Officer may exercise negative discretion to reduce the amount of, or
eliminate, a Cash Bonus Award that otherwise would be payable to a
Participant. The Board of Directors will determine the amount of any Cash
Bonus Award to be paid to the Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors
may increase, but not reduce or eliminate, the Chief Executive Officers Cash
Bonus Award. 

 

VI. PAYMENT OF CASH BONUS AWARDS

 

Payment of Cash Bonus Awards shall be made in a lump sum cash payment (1)
within ninety (90) days following the attainment of Performance Goal A, and
(2) within 30 days following the end of each quarter with respect to
Performance Goal B; _provided_ , _that_ , in no case will payments be made
later than March 15 of the year following the year in which the applicable
Performance Goal is achieved. For avoidance of doubt, a participant will not
be entitled to payment of a Cash Bonus Award if he is not employed on the date

date the Performance Goal is achieved need not be employed on the payment
date.

B. In addition, nothing contained in the Plan shall prohibit the Company or
any of its subsidiaries from establishing other incentive compensation plans
providing for the payment of incentive compensation to employees (including
Participants).

 

IX. ADMINISTRATION, AMENDMENT AND INTERPRETATION OF THE PLAN

 

A. The Board of Directors shall have the right to amend the Plan from time to
time or to repeal it entirely or to direct the discontinuance of Cash Bonus
Awards either temporarily or permanently; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless
required by applicable law or accounting rules, no amendment or termination of
the Plan shall operate to annul or detrimentally affect, without the consent
of the Participant, a Cash Bonus Award already made hereunder.

 

B. This Plan will be administered by the Committee. The Committee shall have
the authority to (i) interpret, administer, reconcile any inconsistency,
correct any defect and/or supply any omission in the Plan and any instrument

creditor of the Company.

 

D. This Plan will not confer upon any Participant any right with respect to
continuance of employment or other service with the Company or any subsidiary,
nor will it interfere in any way with any right the Company or any subsidiary
would otherwise have to terminate or modify the terms of such Participant\'s
employment or other service at any time.

 

E. Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, no right or benefit under this
Plan will be subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, assignment, pledge,
encumbrance, or charge, and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, assign,
pledge, encumber, or charge such right or benefit will be void. No such right
or benefit will in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts,
liabilities, or torts of a Participant.

 

F. If any provision in this Plan is held to be invalid or unenforceable, no
other provision of this Plan will be affected thereby.

determinations shall be by the affirmative vote of a majority of the members
of the Board present at a meeting or by unanimous consent of the Board
executed in writing in accordance with the Companys certificate of
incorporation and by-laws and applicable law. The interpretation and
construction by the Board of any provision of the Plan, any Award or any Award
Agreement shall be final, binding and conclusive.

 

3.2. Committee. 

 

The Board from time to time may delegate to the Committee such powers and
authorities related to the administration and implementation of the Plan, as

Awards under the Plan to such employees or other Service Providers, and may
determine all terms of such Awards.

 



 

In the event that the Plan, any Award or any Award Agreement entered into
hereunder provides for any action to be taken by or determination to be made
by the Board, such action may be taken or such determination may be made by
the Committee if the power and authority to do so has been delegated to the
Committee by the Board as provided for in this Section. Unless otherwise
expressly determined by the Board, any such action or determination by the
Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive. To the extent permitted by
law, the Committee may delegate its authority under the Plan to a member of

subject thereto, the treatment of an Award in the event of a change of
control, and any terms or conditions that may be necessary to qualify Options
as Incentive Stock Options),

 

(v) prescribe the form of each Award Agreement evidencing an Award, and

policy, or custom. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment, modification
or supplement of any Award shall, without the consent of the Grantee, impair
the Grantees rights under such Award.

of the gain realized by a Grantee on account of actions taken by the Grantee
in violation or breach of or in conflict with any employment agreement, non-
competition agreement, any agreement prohibiting solicitation of employees or
clients of the Company or any Affiliate thereof or any confidentiality
obligation with respect to the Company or any Affiliate

Furthermore, the Company may annul an Award if the Grantee is an employee of
the Company or an Affiliate thereof and is terminated for Cause as defined in
the applicable Award Agreement or the Plan, as applicable.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment or modification may be made to an
outstanding Option or SAR which reduces the Option Price or SAR Exercise
Price, either by lowering the Option Price or SAR Exercise Price or by
canceling the outstanding Option or SAR and granting a replacement Option or
SAR with a lower exercise price without the approval of the stockholders of
the Company, provided, that, appropriate adjustments may be made to
outstanding Options and SARs pursuant to Section 17.

 

Furthermore, if the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement
due to the material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct,
with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the
individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 and any Grantee who knowingly engaged in the misconduct, was
grossly negligent in engaging in the misconduct, knowingly failed to prevent
the misconduct or was grossly negligent in failing to prevent the misconduct,
shall reimburse the Company the amount of any payment in settlement of an
Award earned or accrued during the twelve-(12) month period following the
first public issuance or filing with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (whichever first occurred) of the financial document that contained
such material noncompliance.

 

3.4. Deferral Arrangement. 

 

The Board may permit or require the deferral of any award payment into a
deferred compensation arrangement, subject to such rules and procedures as it
may establish, which may include provisions for the payment or crediting of
interest or dividend equivalents, including converting such credits into
deferred Stock equivalents. Any such deferrals shall be made in a manner that
complies with Code Section 409A.

 

3.5. No Liability.

determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Award or
Award Agreement.

of Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall be the lesser of (i)
4,680,000; and (ii) an amount equal to eight and one-half percent (8-1/2%) of
the issued and outstanding shares of Stock immediately following the Workflow
Closing. All shares of Stock issuable under the Plan may be issued as
Incentive Stock Options. Stock issued or to be issued under the Plan shall be

issued shares that have been reacquired by the Company. 

 

4.2. Adjustments in Authorized Shares

 

The Board shall have the right to substitute or assume Awards in connection
with mergers, reorganizations, separations, or other transactions to which
Section 424(a) of the Code applies. The number of shares of Stock reserved

assumed and, in the case of a substitution, by the net increase in the number
of shares of Stock subject to Awards before and after the substitution.

 

4.3. Share Usage

 

Shares covered by an Award shall be counted as used as of the Grant Date. If
any shares covered by an Award are not purchased or are forfeited or expire,
or if an Award otherwise terminates without delivery of any Stock subject
thereto or is settled in cash in lieu of shares, then the number of shares of
Stock counted against the aggregate number of shares available under the Plan
with respect to such Award shall, to the extent of any such forfeiture,
termination or expiration, again be available for making Awards under the
Plan. Furthermore, the number of shares subject to an award of SARs will be
counted against the aggregate number of shares available for issuance under
the Plan regardless of the number of shares actually issued to settle the SAR
upon exercise.

 

5. EFFECTIVE DATE, DURATION AND AMENDMENTS

 

5.1. Effective Date.

 

The Plan shall be effective as of the Effective Date, subject to approval of

fully effective as if the stockholders of the Company had approved the Plan on
the Effective Date. If the stockholders fail to approve the Plan within one
year of the Effective Date, any Awards made hereunder shall be null and void
and of no effect.

The Board may, at any time and from time to time, amend, suspend, or terminate
the Plan as to any shares of Stock as to which Awards have not been made. An
amendment shall be contingent on approval of the Companys stockholders to the
extent stated by the Board, required by applicable law or required by
applicable stock exchange listing requirements. No Awards shall be made after
termination of the Plan. No amendment, suspension, or termination of the Plan
shall, without the consent of the Grantee, impair rights or obligations under
any Award theretofore awarded under the Plan.

8.4. Termination of Service. 

 

Each Award Agreement shall set forth the extent to which the Grantee shall
have the right to exercise the Option following termination of the Grantees
Service. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the
Board, need not be uniform among all Options issued pursuant to the Plan, and
may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination of Service. 

 

8.5. Limitations on Exercise of Option. 

 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, in no event may any Option be
exercised, in whole or in part, prior to the date the Plan is approved by the

Option. 

 

8.6. Method of Exercise. 

 

Subject to Article 12 and Section 18.3, an Option that is exercisable may be
exercised by the Grantees delivery to the Company of written notice of

Option is being exercised plus the amount (if any) of federal and/or other
taxes which the Company may, in its judgment, be required to withhold with

attributable to the subject shares of Stock or to direct the voting of the
subject shares of Stock ) until the shares of Stock covered thereby are fully
paid and issued to him. Except as provided in Section 17 hereof, no
adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for
which the record date is prior to the date of such issuance.

and conditions as were applicable immediately prior to transfer. Subsequent
transfers of transferred Options are prohibited except to Family Members of
the original Grantee in accordance with this Section 8.10 or by will or the
laws of descent and distribution. The events of termination of Service of
Section 8.4 hereof shall continue to be applied with respect to the original
Grantee, following which the Option shall be exercisable by the transferee
only to the extent, and for the periods specified, in Section 8.4.

 

8.11. Limitations on Incentive Stock Options. 

 

An Option shall constitute an Incentive Stock Option only (i) if the Grantee
of such Option is an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company;
(ii) to the extent specifically provided in the related Award Agreement; and
(iii) to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the
time the Option is granted) of the shares of Stock with respect to which all
Incentive Stock Options held by such Grantee become exercisable for the first
time during any calendar year (under the Plan and all other plans of the
Grantees employer and its Affiliates) does not exceed $100,000. This
limitation shall be applied by taking Options into account in the order in
which they were granted.

share of Stock on the date of grant. SARs may be granted in conjunction with
all or part of an Option granted under the Plan or at any subsequent time
during the term of such Option, in conjunction with all or part of any other

be or become exercisable following termination of Service or upon other
conditions, the method of exercise, method of settlement, form of

be in tandem or in combination with any other Award, and any other terms and
conditions of any SAR.

Board may, in its sole discretion, at the time a grant of Restricted Stock or
Stock Units is made, prescribe restrictions in addition to or other than the
expiration of the restricted period, including the satisfaction of corporate
or individual performance objectives, which may be applicable to all or any
portion of the Restricted Stock or Stock Units as described in Article 14.

obligation of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of the
applicable Award Agreement.

 

10.6. Termination of Service. 

 

Unless the Board otherwise provides in an Award Agreement or in writing after
the Award Agreement is issued, upon the termination of a Grantees Service,
any Restricted Stock or Stock Units held by such Grantee that have not vested,
or with respect to which all applicable restrictions and conditions have not
lapsed, shall immediately be deemed forfeited. Upon forfeiture of Restricted
Stock or Stock Units, the Grantee shall have no further rights with respect to
such Award, including but not limited to any right to vote Restricted Stock or
any right to receive dividends with respect to shares of Restricted Stock or
Stock Units. 

 

10.7. Purchase of Restricted Stock.

 

The Grantee shall be required, to the extent required by applicable law, to
purchase the Restricted Stock from the Company at a Purchase Price equal to
the greater of (i) the aggregate par value of the shares of Stock represented
by such Restricted Stock or (ii) the Purchase Price, if any, specified in the
Award Agreement relating to such Restricted Stock. The Purchase Price shall
be payable in a form described in Section 12 or, in the discretion of the
Board, in consideration for past Services rendered to the Company or an
Affiliate.

 

10.8. Delivery of Stock. 

 

Upon the expiration or termination of any restricted period and the
satisfaction of any other conditions prescribed by the Board, the restrictions
applicable to shares of Restricted

 


  

 

F-20

  Stock or Stock Units settled in Stock shall lapse, and, unless otherwise
provided in the Award Agreement, a stock certificate for such shares shall be
delivered, free of all such restrictions, to the Grantee or the Grantees
beneficiary or estate, as the case may be. Neither the Grantee, nor the
Grantees beneficiary or estate, shall have any further rights with regard to
a Stock Unit once the share of Stock represented by the Stock Unit has been
delivered.

 

11. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF UNRESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS

 

The Board may, in its sole discretion, grant (or sell at par value or such
other higher purchase price determined by the Board) an Unrestricted Stock
Award to any Grantee pursuant to which such Grantee may receive shares of
Stock free of any restrictions ("Unrestricted Stock") under the Plan.
Unrestricted Stock Awards may be granted or sold as described in the preceding
sentence in respect of past services and other valid consideration, or in lieu
of, or in addition to, any cash compensation due to such Grantee.

 

12. FORM OF PAYMENT FOR OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK

 

12.1. General Rule.

 

Payment of the Option Price for the shares purchased pursuant to the exercise
of an Option or the Purchase Price for Restricted Stock shall be made in cash
or in cash equivalents acceptable to the Company.

 

12.2. Surrender of Stock.

 

To the extent the Award Agreement so provides, payment of the Option Price for
shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of an Option or the Purchase Price
for Restricted Stock may be made all or in part through the tender or
attestation to the Company of shares of Stock, which shall be valued, for
purposes of determining the extent to which the Option Price or Purchase Price
has been paid thereby, at their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise or
surrender.

 

12.3. Cashless Exercise.

 

With respect to an Option only (and not with respect to Restricted Stock), to
the extent permitted by law and to the extent the Award Agreement so provides,
payment of the Option Price for shares purchased pursuant to the exercise of
an Option may be made all or in part by delivery (on a form acceptable to the
Board) of an irrevocable direction to a licensed securities broker acceptable
to the Company to sell shares of Stock and to deliver all or part of the sales
proceeds to the Company in payment of the Option Price and any withholding
taxes described in Section 18.3.

 


  

 

F-21

  12.4. Other Forms of Payment.

 

To the extent the Award Agreement so provides, payment of the Option Price for
shares purchased pursuant to exercise of an Option or the Purchase Price for
Restricted Stock may be made in any other form that is consistent with
applicable laws, regulations and rules, including, without limitation,
Service.

 

13. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS

 

13.1. Dividend Equivalent Rights. 

 

A Dividend Equivalent Right is an Award entitling the recipient to receive
credits based on cash distributions that would have been paid on the shares of
Stock specified in the Dividend Equivalent Right (or other award to which it
relates) if such shares had been issued to and held by the recipient. A
Dividend Equivalent Right may be granted hereunder to any Grantee. The terms
and conditions of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be specified in the grant.
Dividend equivalents credited to the holder of a Dividend Equivalent Right may
be paid currently or may be deemed to be reinvested in additional shares of
Stock, which may thereafter accrue additional equivalents. Any such
reinvestment shall be at Fair Market Value on the date of reinvestment.
Dividend Equivalent Rights may be settled in cash or Stock or a combination
thereof, in a single installment or installments, all determined in the sole
discretion of the Board. A Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component
of another Award may provide that such Dividend Equivalent Right shall be
settled upon exercise, settlement, or payment of, or lapse of restrictions on,
such other award, and that such Dividend Equivalent Right shall expire or be
forfeited or annulled under the same conditions as such other award. A
Dividend Equivalent Right granted as a component of another Award may also
contain terms and conditions different from such other award.

 

13.2. Termination of Service. 

 

Except as may otherwise be provided by the Board either in the Award Agreement
or in writing after the Award Agreement is issued, a Grantees rights in all
Dividend Equivalent Rights or interest equivalents shall automatically
terminate upon the Grantees termination of Service for any reason.

 

14. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PERFORMANCESHARES, PERFORMANCE 
 UNITS, PERFORMANCE AWARDS AND ANNUAL INCENTIVE AWARDS

 

14.1. Grant of Performance Units/Performance Shares. 

 

Subject to the terms and provisions of this Plan, the Board, at any time and
from time to time, may grant Performance Units and/or Performance Shares to
Participants in such amounts and upon such terms as the Committee shall
determine.

 


  

 

F-22

  

 

14.2. Value of Performance Units/Performance Shares. 

 

 Each Performance Unit shall have an initial value that is established by the
Board at the time of grant. The Board shall set performance goals in its
discretion which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will
determine the value and/or number of Performance Units/Performance Shares that
will be paid out to the Participant.

 

14.3. Earning of Performance Units/Performance Shares.

 

Subject to the terms of this Plan, after the applicable Performance Period has
ended, the holder of Performance Units/Performance Shares shall be entitled to
receive payout on the value and number of Performance Units/Performance Shares
earned by the Participant over the Performance Period, to be determined as a
function of the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been
achieved.

 

14.4. Form and Timing of Payment of Performance Units/Performance Shares. 

 

Payment of earned Performance Units/Performance Shares shall be as determined
by the Board and as evidenced in the Award Agreement. Subject to the terms of
this Plan, the Board, in its sole discretion, may pay earned Performance
Units/Performance Shares in the form of cash or in shares (or in a combination
thereof) equal to the value of the earned Performance Units/Performance Shares
at the close of the applicable Performance Period, or as soon as practicable
after the end of the Performance Period. Any Shares may be granted subject to
any restrictions deemed appropriate by the Committee. The determination of
the Committee with respect to the form of payout of such Awards shall be set
forth in the Award Agreement pertaining to the grant of the Award.

 

14.5. Performance Conditions.

 

The right of a Grantee to exercise or receive a grant or settlement of any
Award, and the timing thereof, may be subject to such performance conditions
as may be specified by the Board. The Board may use such business criteria
and other measures of performance as it may deem appropriate in establishing
any performance conditions. If and to the extent required under Code Section
162(m), any power or authority relating to an Award intended to qualify under
Code Section 162(m), shall be exercised by the Committee and not the Board.

 

14.6. Performance Awards or Annual Incentive Awards Granted to Designated 
 Covered Employees.

 

If and to the extent that the Board determines that an Award to be granted to
a Grantee who is designated by the Committee as likely to be a Covered
Employee should qualify as "performance-based compensation" for purposes of
Code Section 162(m), the grant, exercise and/or settlement of such Award shall
be contingent upon achievement of pre-established performance goals and other
terms set forth in this Section 14.6.

 


  

 

F-23

   

14.6.1. Performance Goals Generally.

 

The performance goals for such Awards shall consist of one or more business
criteria and a targeted level or levels of performance with respect to each of
such criteria, as specified by the Committee consistent with this Section
14.6. Performance goals shall be objective and shall otherwise meet the
requirements of Code Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder including the
requirement that the level or levels of performance targeted by the Committee
result in the achievement of performance goals being "substantially
uncertain." The Committee may determine that such Awards shall be granted,
exercised and/or settled upon achievement of any one performance goal or that
two or more of the performance goals must be achieved as a condition to grant,
exercise and/or settlement of such Awards. Performance goals may differ for
Awards granted to any one Grantee or to different Grantees.

 

14.6.2. Timing For Establishing Performance Goals. 

 

Performance goals shall be established not later than the earlier of 90 days
after the beginning of any performance period applicable to such Awards or the
day on which 25% of any performance period applicable to such Awards expires,
or at such other date as may be required or permitted for "performance-based
compensation" under Code Section 162(m).

 

14.6.3. Settlement of Awards; Other Terms.

 

Settlement of such Awards shall be in cash, Stock, other Awards or other
property, in the discretion of the Committee. The Committee may, in its
discretion, reduce the amount of a settlement otherwise to be made in
connection with such Awards. The Committee shall specify the circumstances in
which such Performance or Annual Incentive Awards shall be paid or forfeited
in the event of termination of Service by the Grantee prior to the end of a
performance period or settlement of Awards.

 

14.6.4. Performance Measures.

 

 The performance goals upon which the payment or vesting of an Award to a
Covered Employee that is intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation
shall be limited to the following Performance Measures:

 

(a) net earnings or net income;

 

(b) operating earnings;

 

(c) pretax earnings;

 

(d) earnings per share;

 

(e) share price, including growth measures and total stockholder return;

 


  

 

F-24

  (f) earnings before interest and taxes;

 

(g) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and/or amortization;

 

(h) sales or revenue growth, whether in general, by type of product or
service, or by type of customer;

 

(i) gross or operating margins;

 

(j) return measures, including return on assets, capital, investment, equity,
sales or revenue;

 

(k) cash flow, including operating cash flow, free cash flow, cash flow
return on equity and cash flow return on investment;

 

(l) productivity ratios;

 

(m) expense targets;

 

(n) market share;

 

(o) financial ratios as provided in credit agreements of the Company and its
subsidiaries;

 

(p) working capital targets;

 

(q) completion of acquisitions of business or companies.

 

(r) completion of divestitures and asset sales; and

 

(s) any combination of any of the foregoing business criteria. 

 

[Customize if necessary]

 

Any Performance Measure(s) may be used to measure the performance of the
Company, Subsidiary, and/or Affiliate as a whole or any business unit of the
Company, Subsidiary, and/or Affiliate or any combination thereof, as the
Committee may deem appropriate, or any of the above Performance Measures as
compared to the performance of a group of comparator companies, or published
or special index that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems
appropriate, or the Company may select Performance Measure (f) above as
compared to various stock market indices. The Committee also has the authority
to provide for accelerated vesting of any Award based on the achievement of
performance goals pursuant to the Performance Measures specified in this
Section 14.

 


  

 

F-25

   

14.6.5. Evaluation of Performance.

 

 The Committee may provide in any such Award that any evaluation of
performance may include or exclude any of the following events that occur
during a Performance Period: (a) asset write-downs; (b) litigation or claim
judgments or settlements; (c) the effect of changes in tax laws, accounting
principles, or other laws or provisions affecting reported results; (d) any
reorganization and restructuring programs; (e) extraordinary nonrecurring
items as described in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30 and/or in
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations appearing in the Companys annual report to shareholders for the
applicable year; (f) acquisitions or divestitures; and (g) foreign exchange
gains and losses. To the extent such inclusions or exclusions affect Awards to
Covered Employees, they shall be prescribed in a form that meets the
requirements of Code Section 162(m) for deductibility.

 

14.6.6. Adjustment of Performance-Based Compensation. 

 

Awards that are intended to qualify as Performance-Based Compensation may not
be adjusted upward. The Board shall retain the discretion to adjust such
Awards downward, either on a formula or discretionary basis, or any
combination as the Committee determines.

 

14.6.7. Board Discretion. 

 

In the event that applicable tax and/or securities laws change to permit Board
discretion to alter the governing Performance Measures without obtaining
shareholder approval of such changes, the Board shall have sole discretion to
make such changes without obtaining shareholder approval provided the exercise
of such discretion does not violate Code Section 409A. In addition, in the
event that the Committee determines that it is advisable to grant Awards that
shall not qualify as Performance-Based Compensation, the Committee may make
such grants without satisfying the requirements of Code Section 162(m) and
base vesting on Performance Measures other than those set forth in Section
14.6.4.

 

14.7. Status of Section Awards Under Code Section 162(m).

 

It is the intent of the Company that Awards under Section 14.6 hereof granted
to persons who are designated by the Committee as likely to be Covered
Employees within the meaning of Code Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder
shall, if so designated by the Committee, constitute "qualified performance-
based compensation" within the meaning of Code Section 162(m) and regulations
thereunder. Accordingly, the terms of Section 14.6, including the definitions
of Covered Employee and other terms used therein, shall be interpreted in a
manner consistent with Code Section 162(m) and regulations thereunder. The
foregoing notwithstanding, because the Committee cannot determine with
certainty whether a given Grantee will be a Covered Employee with respect to a
fiscal year that has not yet been completed, the term Covered Employee as used
herein shall mean only a person designated by the Committee, at the time of
grant of an Award, as likely to be a Covered Employee with respect to that
fiscal year. If any provision of the Plan or any agreement relating to such
Awards does not comply or is inconsistent with the requirements of Code
Section 162(m) or regulations thereunder, such provision shall be construed or
deemed amended to the extent necessary to conform to such requirements.

 


  

 

F-26

   

15. PARACHUTE LIMITATIONS

 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or of any other agreement,
contract, or understanding heretofore or hereafter entered into by a Grantee
with the Company or any Affiliate, except an agreement, contract, or
understanding that expressly addresses Section 280G or Section 4999 of the
Code (an "Other Agreement"), and notwithstanding any formal or informal plan
or other arrangement for the direct or indirect provision of compensation to
the Grantee (including groups or classes of Grantees or beneficiaries of which
the Grantee is a member), whether or not such compensation is deferred, is in
cash, or is in the form of a benefit to or for the Grantee (a "Benefit
Arrangement"), if the Grantee is a "disqualified individual," as defined in
Section 280G(c) of the Code, any Option, Restricted Stock, Stock Unit,
Performance Share or Performance Unit held by that Grantee and any right to
receive any payment or other benefit under this Plan shall not become
exercisable or vested (i) to the extent that such right to exercise, vesting,
payment, or benefit, taking into account all other rights, payments, or
benefits to or for the Grantee under this Plan, all Other Agreements, and all
Benefit Arrangements, would cause any payment or benefit to the Grantee under
this Plan to be considered a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code as then in effect (a "Parachute Payment") _and_ (ii)
if, as a result of receiving a Parachute Payment, the aggregate after-tax
amounts received by the Grantee from the Company under this Plan, all Other
Agreements, and all Benefit Arrangements would be less than the maximum after-
tax amount that could be received by the Grantee without causing any such
payment or benefit to be considered a Parachute Payment. In the event that
the receipt of any such right to exercise, vesting, payment, or benefit under
this Plan, in conjunction with all other rights, payments, or benefits to or
for the Grantee under any Other Agreement or any Benefit Arrangement would
cause the Grantee to be considered to have received a Parachute Payment under
this Plan that would have the effect of decreasing the after-tax amount
received by the Grantee as described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence,
then the Grantee shall have the right, in the Grantees sole discretion, to
designate those rights, payments, or benefits under this Plan, any Other
Agreements, and any Benefit Arrangements that should be reduced or eliminated
so as to avoid having the payment or benefit to the Grantee under this Plan be
deemed to be a Parachute Payment; provided, however, that in order to comply
with Code Section 409A, the reduction or elimination will be performed in the
order in which each dollar of value subject to an Award reduces the Parachute
Payment to the greatest extent.

 

16. REQUIREMENTS OF LAW

 

16.1. General.

 

The Company shall not be required to sell or issue any shares of Stock under
any Award if the sale or issuance of such shares would constitute a violation
by the Grantee, any other individual exercising an Option, or the Company of
any provision of any law or regulation of any governmental authority,
including without limitation any federal or state securities laws or
regulations. If at any time the Company shall determine, in its discretion,

 


  

 

F-27

  that the listing, registration or qualification of any shares subject to an
Award upon any securities exchange or under any governmental regulatory body
is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the
issuance or purchase of shares hereunder, no shares of Stock may be issued or
sold to the Grantee or any other individual exercising an Option pursuant to
such Award unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or
approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not
acceptable to the Company, and any delay caused thereby shall in no way affect
the date of termination of the Award. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in connection with the Securities Act, upon the exercise of any
Option or any SAR that may be settled in shares of Stock or the delivery of
any shares of Stock underlying an Award, unless a registration statement under
such Act is in effect with respect to the shares of Stock covered by such
Award, the Company shall not be required to sell or issue such shares unless
the Board has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Grantee or any
other individual exercising an Option may acquire such shares pursuant to an
exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Any determination in
this connection by the Board shall be final, binding, and conclusive. The
Company may, but shall in no event be obligated to, register any securities
covered hereby pursuant to the Securities Act. The Company shall not be
obligated to take any affirmative action in order to cause the exercise of an
Option or a SAR or the issuance of shares of Stock pursuant to the Plan to
comply with any law or regulation of any governmental authority. As to any
jurisdiction that expressly imposes the requirement that an Option (or SAR
that may be settled in shares of Stock) shall not be exercisable until the
shares of Stock covered by such Option (or SAR) are registered or are exempt
from registration, the exercise of such Option (or SAR) under circumstances in
which the laws of such jurisdiction apply shall be deemed conditioned upon the
effectiveness of such registration or the availability of such an exemption.

 

16.2. Rule 16b-3. 

 

During any time when the Company has a class of equity security registered
under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, it is the intent of the Company that
Awards pursuant to the Plan and the exercise of Options and SARs granted
hereunder will qualify for the exemption provided by Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act. To the extent that any provision of the Plan or action by the
Board does not comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3, it shall be deemed
inoperative to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Board,
and shall not affect the validity of the Plan. In the event that Rule 16b-3
is revised or replaced, the Board may exercise its discretion to modify this
Plan in any respect necessary to satisfy the requirements of, or to take
advantage of any features of, the revised exemption or its replacement.

 

17. EFFECT OF CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION 

 

17.1. Changes in Stock. 

 

If the number of outstanding shares of Stock is increased or decreased or the
shares of Stock are changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind
of shares or other securities of the Company on account of any
recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, reverse split, combination of
shares, exchange of shares, stock dividend or other distribution

 


  

 

F-28

   

payable in capital stock, or other increase or decrease in such shares
effected without receipt of consideration by the Company occurring after the
Effective Date, the number and kinds of shares for which grants of Options and
other Awards may be made under the Plan shall be adjusted proportionately and
accordingly by the Company. In addition, the number and kind of shares for
which Awards are outstanding shall be adjusted proportionately and accordingly
so that the proportionate interest of the Grantee immediately following such
event shall, to the extent practicable, be the same as immediately before such
event. Any such adjustment in outstanding Options or SARs shall not change
the aggregate Option Price or SAR Exercise Price payable with respect to
shares that are subject to the unexercised portion of an outstanding Option or
SAR, as applicable, but shall include a corresponding proportionate adjustment
in the Option Price or SAR Exercise Price per share. The conversion of any
convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as an increase in
shares effected without receipt of consideration. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event of any distribution to the Company\'s stockholders of
securities of any other entity or other assets (including an extraordinary
dividend but excluding a non-extraordinary dividend of the Company) without
receipt of consideration by the Company, the Company shall, in such manner as
the Company deems appropriate, adjust (i) the number and kind of shares
subject to outstanding Awards and/or (ii) the exercise price of outstanding
Options and Stock Appreciation Rights to reflect such distribution.

 

17.2. Reorganization in Which the Company Is the Surviving Entity Which does
not Constitute a Corporate Transaction.

 

Subject to Section 17.3 hereof, if the Company shall be the surviving entity
in any reorganization, merger, or consolidation of the Company with one or
more other entities which does not constitute a Corporate Transaction, any
Option or SAR theretofore granted pursuant to the Plan shall pertain to and
apply to the securities to which a holder of the number of shares of Stock
subject to such Option or SAR would have been entitled immediately following
such reorganization, merger, or consolidation, with a corresponding
proportionate adjustment of the Option Price or SAR Exercise Price per share
so that the aggregate Option Price or SAR Exercise Price thereafter shall be
the same as the aggregate Option Price or SAR Exercise Price of the shares
remaining subject to the Option or SAR immediately prior to such
reorganization, merger, or consolidation. Subject to any contrary language in
an Award Agreement evidencing an Award, any restrictions applicable to such
Award shall apply as well to any replacement shares received by the Grantee as
a result of the reorganization, merger or consolidation. In the event of a
transaction described in this Section 17.2, Stock Units shall be adjusted so
as to apply to the securities that a holder of the number of shares of Stock
subject to the Stock Units would have been entitled to receive immediately
following such transaction.

 

17.3. Corporate Transaction.

 

Subject to the exceptions set forth in the last sentence of this Section 17.3
and the last sentence of Section 17.4, upon the occurrence of a Corporate
Transaction:

 



 

(i) all outstanding shares of Restricted Stock shall be deemed to have
vested, and all Stock Units shall be deemed to have vested and the shares of
Stock subject thereto shall be delivered, immediately prior to the occurrence
of such Corporate Transaction, and

 


  

 

F-29

   

(ii) either of the following two actions shall be taken:

 



 

(A) fifteen days prior to the scheduled consummation of a Corporate
Transaction, all Options and SARs outstanding hereunder shall become
immediately exercisable and shall remain exercisable for a period of fifteen
days, or

 



 

(B) the Board may elect, in its sole discretion, to cancel any outstanding
Awards of Options, Restricted Stock, Stock Units, and/or SARs and pay or
deliver, or cause to be paid or delivered, to the holder thereof an amount in
cash or securities having a value (as determined by the Board acting in good
faith), in the case of Restricted Stock or Stock Units, equal to the formula
or fixed price per share paid to holders of shares of Stock and, in the case
of Options or SARs, equal to the product of the number of shares of Stock
subject to the Option or SAR (the "Award Shares") multiplied by the amount, if
any, by which (I) the formula or fixed price per share paid to holders of
shares of Stock pursuant to such transaction exceeds (II) the Option Price or
SAR Exercise Price applicable to such Award Shares. 

 



 

With respect to the Company\'s establishment of an exercise window, (i) any
exercise of an Option or SAR during such fifteen-day period shall be
conditioned upon the consummation of the event and shall be effective only
immediately before the consummation of the event, and (ii) upon consummation
of any Corporate Transaction, the Plan and all outstanding but unexercised
Options and SARs shall terminate. The Board shall send notice of an event
that will result in such a termination to all individuals who hold Options and
SARs not later than the time at which the Company gives notice thereof to its
stockholders. This Section 17.3 shall not apply to any Corporate Transaction
to the extent that provision is made in writing in connection with such
Corporate Transaction for the assumption or continuation of the Options, SARs,
Stock Units and Restricted Stock theretofore granted, or for the substitution
for such Options, SARs, Stock Units and Restricted Stock for new common stock
options and stock appreciation rights and new common stock units and
restricted stock relating to the stock of a successor entity, or a parent or
subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the number of shares
(disregarding any consideration that is not common stock) and option and stock
appreciation right exercise prices, in which event the Plan, Options, SARs,
Stock Units and Restricted Stock theretofore granted shall continue in the
manner and under the terms so provided.

 

17.4. Adjustments. 

 

Adjustments under this Section 17 related to shares of Stock or securities of
the Company shall be made by the Board, whose determination in that respect
shall be final, binding and conclusive. No fractional shares or other
securities shall be issued pursuant to any such adjustment, and any fractions
resulting from any such adjustment shall be eliminated in each case by
rounding downward to the nearest whole share. The Board shall determine the
effect of a Corporate Transaction upon Awards other than Options, SARs, Stock
Units and Restricted Stock, and such effect shall be set forth in the
appropriate Award Agreement. The Board may provide in the Award Agreements at
the time of grant, or any time thereafter with the consent of the Grantee, for
different provisions to apply to an Award in place of those described in
Sections 17.1, 17.2 and 17.3.

 


  

 

F-30

  17.5. No Limitations on Company. 

 

The making of Awards pursuant to the Plan shall not affect or limit in any way
the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassifications,
reorganizations, or changes of its capital or business structure or to merge,
consolidate, dissolve, or liquidate, or to sell or transfer all or any part of
its business or assets.

 

18. GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

18.1. Disclaimer of Rights

 

No provision in the Plan or in any Award or Award Agreement shall be construed
to confer upon any individual the right to remain in the employ or service of
the Company or any Affiliate, or to interfere in any way with any contractual
or other right or authority of the Company either to increase or decrease the
compensation or other payments to any individual at any time, or to terminate
any employment or other relationship between any individual and the Company.
In addition, notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary,
unless otherwise stated in the applicable Award Agreement, no Award granted
under the Plan shall be affected by any change of duties or position of the
Grantee, so long as such Grantee continues to be a director, officer,
consultant or employee of the Company or an Affiliate. The obligation of the
Company to pay any benefits pursuant to this Plan shall be interpreted as a
contractual obligation to pay only those amounts described herein, in the
manner and under the conditions prescribed herein. The Plan shall in no way
be interpreted to require the Company to transfer any amounts to a third party
trustee or otherwise hold any amounts in trust or escrow for payment to any
Grantee or beneficiary under the terms of the Plan. 

 

18.2. Nonexclusivity of the Plan

 

Neither the adoption of the Plan nor the submission of the Plan to the
stockholders of the Company for approval shall be construed as creating any
limitations upon the right and authority of the Board to adopt such other
incentive compensation arrangements (which arrangements may be applicable
either generally to a class or classes of individuals or specifically to a
particular individual or particular individuals) as the Board in its
discretion determines desirable, including, without limitation, the granting
of stock options otherwise than under the Plan.

 

18.3. Withholding Taxes

 

The Company or an Affiliate, as the case may be, shall have the right to
deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to a Grantee any federal,
state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect
to the vesting of or other lapse of restrictions applicable to an Award or
upon the issuance of any shares of Stock upon the exercise of an Option or
pursuant to an Award. At the time of such vesting, lapse, or exercise, the
Grantee shall pay to the Company or the Affiliate, as the case may be, any
amount that the Company or the Affiliate may reasonably determine to be
necessary to satisfy such withholding obligation. Subject to the prior
approval of the Company or the Affiliate, which may be withheld by the Company
or the Affiliate, as the case

 


  

 

F-31

   

may be, in its sole discretion, the Grantee may elect to satisfy such
obligations, in whole or in part, (i) by causing the Company or the Affiliate
to withhold shares of Stock otherwise issuable to the Grantee or (ii) by
delivering to the Company or the Affiliate shares of Stock already owned by
the Grantee. The shares of Stock so delivered or withheld shall have an
aggregate Fair Market Value equal to such withholding obligations. The Fair
Market Value of the shares of Stock used to satisfy such withholding
obligation shall be determined by the Company or the Affiliate as of the date
that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. A Grantee who has
made an election pursuant to this Section 18.3 may satisfy his or her
withholding obligation only with shares of Stock that are not subject to any
repurchase, forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting, or other similar requirements.
The maximum number of shares of Stock that may be withheld from any Award to
satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding requirements upon the
exercise, vesting, lapse of restrictions applicable to such Award or payment
of shares pursuant to such Award, as applicable, cannot exceed such number of
shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the minimum statutory amount
required by the Company to be withheld and paid to any such federal, state or
local taxing authority with respect to such exercise, vesting, lapse of
restrictions or payment of shares.

not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined by the Board, in its sole
discretion.

2. _REGISTRATION RIGHTS_.

 

2.1. _Demand Registration_.

 

2.1.1. _Request for Registration. _At any time and from time to time on or
after the Release Date, all the holders of a majority-in-interest of
Registrable Securities held by the Perseus Shareholders may make a written
demand for registration under the Securities Act of all or part of Registrable
Securities (a "Demand Registration"). Any demand for a Demand Registration
shall specify the number of shares of Registrable Securities proposed to be
sold and the intended method(s) of distribution thereof. The Company will
notify all holders of Registrable Securities of the demand, and each holder of
Registrable Securities who wishes to include all or a portion of such
holder\'s Registrable Securities in the Demand Registration (each such holder
including shares of Registrable Securities in such registration, a "Demanding
Holder") shall so notify the Company within fifteen (15) days after the
receipt by the holder of the notice from the Company. Upon any such request,
the Demanding Holders shall be entitled to have their Registrable Securities
included in the Demand Registration, subject to Section 2.1.4 and the provisos
set forth in Section 3.1.1. The Company shall not be obligated to effect more
than three (3) Demand Registrations upon the request of a majority of the
Registrable Securities held by Perseus Shareholders.

 

2.1.2. _Effective Registration. _A registration will not count as a Demand
Registration until the Registration Statement filed with the Commission with
respect to such Demand Registration has been declared effective and the
Company has complied with all of its obligations under this Agreement with
respect thereto; provided, however, that if, after such Registration Statement
has been declared effective, the offering of Registrable Securities pursuant
to a Demand Registration is interfered with by any stop order or injunction of
the Commission or any other governmental agency or court, the Registration
Statement with respect to such Demand Registration will be deemed not to have
been declared effective, unless and until, (i) such stop order or injunction
is removed, rescinded or otherwise terminated, and (ii) a majority-in-interest
of the Demanding Holders thereafter elect to continue the offering; provided,
further, that the Company shall not be obligated to file a second Registration
Statement on behalf of such holders until a Registration Statement that has
been filed is counted as a Demand Registration or is terminated.

 


  

 

G-3

   

2.1.3. _Underwritten Offering. _If a majority-in-interest of the Demanding
Holders so elect and such holders so advise the Company as part of their
written demand for a Demand Registration, the offering of such Registrable
Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration shall be in the form of an
underwritten offering; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
obligated to effect more than a total of four (4) underwritten offerings for
either Demand Registrations pursuant to Section 2.1.1 or registrations on a
Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to Section 2.3. In such event, the
right of any holder to include its Registrable Securities in such registration
shall be conditioned upon such holder\'s participation in such underwriting
and the inclusion of such holder\'s Registrable Securities in the underwriting
to the extent provided herein. All Demanding Holders proposing to distribute
their securities through such underwriting shall enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the Underwriter or Underwriters selected for
such underwriting by a majority-in-interest of the holders initiating the
Demand Registration. 

 

2.1.4. _Reduction of Offering. _If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters
for a Demand Registration that is to be an underwritten offering advises the
Company and the Demanding Holders in writing that the dollar amount or number
of shares of Registrable Securities which the Demanding Holders desire to
sell, taken together with all other shares of Common Stock or other securities
which the Company desires to sell and the shares of Common Stock, if any, as
to which registration has been requested pursuant to written contractual
piggy-back registration rights held by other stockholders of the Company who
desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of shares
that can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the proposed
offering price, the timing, the distribution method, or the probability of
success of such offering (such maximum dollar amount or maximum number of
shares, as applicable, the "Maximum Number of Shares"), then the Company shall
include in such registration: (i) first, as a group, the Registrable
Securities of Investors requesting to be included in such registration (pro
rata in accordance with the number of shares that each such Person has
requested be included in such registration, regardless of the number of shares
held by each such Person (such proportion is referred to herein as "Pro
Rata")) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (ii)
second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached
under the foregoing clause (i), the shares of Common Stock or other securities
that the Company desires to sell that can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Shares; and (iii) third, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Shares have not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii), the shares of Common Stock or other securities for the account of other
persons that the Company is obligated to register pursuant to written
contractual arrangements with such persons and that can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares.

 

2.1.5. _Withdrawal. _If a majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders
disapprove of the terms of any underwriting or are not entitled to include all
of their Registrable Securities in any offering, such majority-in-interest of
the Demanding Holders may elect to withdraw from such offering by giving
written notice to the Company and the Underwriter or Underwriters of their
request to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement
filed with the Commission with respect to such Demand Registration. If the
majority-in-interest of the Demanding Holders withdraws from a proposed
offering relating to a Demand Registration, then such registration shall not
count as a Demand Registration provided for in Section 2.1.

 

2.2. _Piggy-Back Registration_.

 

2.2.1. _Piggy-Back Rights. _If at any time on or after the Release Date the
Company proposes to file a Registration Statement under the Securities Act
with respect to an offering of equity securities, or securities or other
obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or convertible into, equity
securities, by the Company for its own account or for stockholders of the
Company for their account (or by the Company and by stockholders of the
Company including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 2.1),

 


  

 

G-4

   

other than a Registration Statement (i) filed in connection with any employee
stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or offering of
securities solely to the Company\'s existing stockholders, (iii) for an
offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of the Company or
(iv) for a dividend reinvestment plan, then the Company shall (x) give written
notice of such proposed filing to the holders of Registrable Securities as
soon as practicable but in no event less than ten (10) days before the
anticipated filing date, which notice shall describe the amount and type of
securities to be included in such offering, the intended method(s) of
distribution, and the name of the proposed managing Underwriter or
Underwriters, if any, of the offering, and (y) offer to the holders of
Registrable Securities in such notice the opportunity to register the sale of
such number of shares of Registrable Securities as such holders may request in
writing within five (5) days following receipt of such notice (a "Piggy-Back
Registration"). The Company shall cause such Registrable Securities to be
included in such registration and shall use its best efforts to cause the
managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed underwritten offering to
permit the Registrable Securities requested to be included in a Piggy-Back
Registration on the same terms and conditions as any similar securities of the
Company and to permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof.
All holders of Registrable Securities proposing to distribute their securities
through a Piggy-Back Registration that involves an Underwriter or Underwriters
shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the
Underwriter or Underwriters selected for such Piggy-Back Registration. In no
event, however, shall any Management Shareholder sell under a Piggy Back
Registration prior to the expiration of a six-month period following the
Merger.

 

2.2.2. _Reduction of Offering. _If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters
for a Piggy-Back Registration that is to be an underwritten offering advises
the Company and the holders of Registrable Securities in writing that the
dollar amount or number of shares of Common Stock which the Company desires to
sell, taken together with shares of Common Stock, if any, as to which
registration has been demanded pursuant to written contractual arrangements
with persons other than the holders of Registrable Securities hereunder, the
Registrable Securities as to which registration has been requested under this
Section 2.2, and the shares of Common Stock, if any, as to which registration
has been requested pursuant to the written contractual piggy-back registration
rights of other stockholders of the Company, exceeds the Maximum Number of
Shares, then the Company shall include in any such registration:

 

(a) If the registration is undertaken for the Company\'s account: (A) first,
the shares of Common Stock or other securities that the Company desires to
sell that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (B)
second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached
under the foregoing clause (A), the shares of Common Stock or other
securities, if any, comprised of the Registrable Securities and the Initial
Securities, as to which registration has been requested pursuant to the
applicable written contractual piggy-back registration rights of such security
holders, Pro Rata, that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Shares; and (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not
been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the shares of Common
Stock or other securities for the account of other persons that the Company is
obligated to register pursuant to written contractual piggy-back registration
rights with such persons and that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Shares; and

 

(b) If the registration is a "demand" registration undertaken at the demand of
persons other than the holders of Registrable Securities, first, the shares of
Common Stock or other securities for the account of the demanding persons that
can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Shares; (B) second, to the
extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not been reached under the
foregoing clause (A), the shares of Common Stock or other securities that the
Company desires to sell that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number
of Shares; (C) third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Shares has not
been reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B),

 


  

 

G-5

   

collectively the shares of Common Stock or Registrable Securities and the
Initial Securities, Pro Rata, as to which registration has been requested
pursuant to the terms hereof that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Shares; and (D) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Shares has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A), and (C), the
shares of Common Stock or other securities for the account of other persons
that the Company is obligated to register pursuant to written contractual
arrangements with such persons, that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Shares.

 

2.2.3. _Withdrawal. _Any holder of Registrable Securities may elect to
withdraw such holder\'s request for inclusion of Registrable Securities in any
Piggy-Back Registration by giving written notice to the Company of such
request to withdraw prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement.
The Company (whether on its own determination or as the result of a withdrawal
by persons making a demand pursuant to written contractual obligations) may
withdraw a registration statement at any time prior to the effectiveness of
the Registration Statement. Notwithstanding any such withdrawal, the Company
shall pay all expenses incurred by the holders of Registrable Securities in
connection with such Piggy-Back Registration as provided in Section 3.3.

 

2.3. _Registrations on Shelf Registration Statement_. 

 

2.3.1. _Request for Registration_. At any time and from time to time after
the Release Date, any Perseus Shareholder or Greg C. Mosher may request in
writing that the Company register the resale of any or all of such Registrable
Securities on a Shelf Registration Statement. Upon receipt of such written
request, the Company will promptly give written notice of the proposed
registration to all other holders of Registrable Securities, and, as soon as
practicable thereafter, effect the registration of all or such portion of such
holder\'s or holders\' Registrable Securities as are specified in such
request, together with all or such portion of the Registrable Securities or
other securities of the Company, if any, of any other holder or holders
joining in such request as are specified in a written request given within
fifteen (15) days after receipt of such written notice from the Company;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to effect any such
registration pursuant to this Section 2.3 if the holders of the Registrable
Securities, together with the holders of any other securities of the Company
entitled to inclusion in such registration, propose to sell Registrable
Securities and such other securities (if any) at any aggregate price to the
public of less than $500,000. The Company shall use its best efforts to cause
such Shelf Registration Statement to become and remain effective until all
Registrable Securities and other securities covered by such Shelf Registration
Statement have been disposed of in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution set forth in such Shelf Registration Statement or such securities
have been withdrawn. Registrations effected pursuant to this Section 2.3
shall not be counted as Demand Registrations effected pursuant to Section 2.1.

 

2.3.2. _Underwritten offering and reduction of offering_. Registrations
effected pursuant to this Section 2.3 may be in the form of an underwritten
offering pursuant to Section 2.1.3, and if so, such Registration shall be
subject to Section 2.1.4.

 

2.3.3. _Perseus Shareholders right to delay offering. _By written notice to
the Company, the holders of a majority of the Registrable Shares held by the
Perseus Shareholders may require that the Company delay the filing of any
Registration Statement requested to be filed prior to the one year anniversary
of the consummation of the Merger in their reasonable discretion based on
market considerations; provided, however, that the filing of such Registration
Statement may not be delayed under this Section 2.3.3 beyond the one year
anniversary of the consummation of the Merger. Upon receipt of such written
request to delay the offering, the Company will effect such Initial Shelf
Registration Statement Request within twelve (12) months following the Release
Date. _ _ 

 


  

 

G-6

   

3. _REGISTRATION PROCEDURES_.

 

3.1. _Filings: Information_. Whenever the Company is required to effect the
registration of any Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2, the Company
shall use its best efforts to effect the registration and sale of such
Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof as expeditiously as practicable, and in connection with
any such request:

 

3.1.1. _Filing Registration Statement. _The Company shall, as expeditiously
as possible and in any event within sixty (60) days after receipt of a request
for a Demand Registration pursuant to Section 2.1, prepare and file with the
Commission a Registration Statement on any form for which the Company then
qualifies or which counsel for the Company shall deem appropriate and which
form shall be available for the sale of all Registrable Securities to be
registered thereunder in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof, and shall use its best efforts to cause such
Registration Statement to become and remain effective for the period required
by Section 3.1.3; provided, however, that the Company shall have the right to
defer any Demand Registration for up to thirty (30) days, and any Piggy-Back
Registration for such period as may be applicable to deferment of any demand
registration to which such Piggy-Back Registration relates, in each case if
the Company shall furnish to the holders a certificate signed by the Chief
Executive Officer or Chairman of the Company stating that, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, it would be materially
detrimental to the Company and its stockholders for such Registration
Statement to be effected at such time; provided further, however, that the
Company shall not have the right to exercise the right set forth in the
immediately preceding proviso more than once in any 365-day period in respect

Statement (in each case including all exhibits thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein), the prospectus included in such
Registration Statement (including each preliminary prospectus), and such other

facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such
holders.

 

3.1.3. _Amendments and Supplements. _The Company shall prepare and file with
the Commission such amendments, including post-effective amendments, and
supplements to such Registration Statement and the prospectus used in

all Registrable Securities and other securities covered by such Registration
Statement have been disposed of in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution set forth in such Registration Statement (which period shall not
exceed the sum of one hundred eighty (180) days plus any period during which
any such disposition is interfered with by any stop order or injunction of the
Commission or any governmental agency or court) or such securities have been
withdrawn.

 

3.1.4. _Notification. _After the filing of a Registration Statement, the
Company shall promptly, and in no event more than two (2) business days after

amendment to such Registration Statement becomes effective; (iii) the issuance
or threatened issuance by the Commission of any stop order (and the Company

any request by the Commission for any amendment or supplement to such
Registration Statement or any prospectus relating thereto or for additional
information or of the occurrence of an event requiring the preparation of a
supplement or amendment to such prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to
the purchasers of the securities covered by such Registration Statement, such
prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and promptly make available to the holders
of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement any such
supplement or amendment; except that before filing with the Commission a
Registration Statement or prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto,
including documents incorporated by reference, the Company shall furnish to
the holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement
and to the legal counsel for any such holders, copies of all such documents
proposed to be filed sufficiently in advance of filing to provide such holders
and legal counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review such documents and
comment thereon, and the Company shall not file any Registration Statement or
prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto, including documents
incorporated by reference, to which such holders or their legal counsel shall
reasonably object.

 

3.1.5. _State Securities Laws Compliance. _The Company shall use its best
efforts to (i) register or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement under such securities or "blue sky" laws of such
jurisdictions in the United States as the holders of Registrable Securities

distribution) may request and (ii) take such action necessary to cause such
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be registered
with or approved by such other Governmental Authorities as may be necessary by
virtue of the business and operations of the Company and do any and all other
acts and things that may be necessary or advisable to enable the holders of
Registrable Securities included in such Registration Statement to consummate
the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to qualify generally
to do business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to
qualify but for this paragraph or subject itself to taxation in any such
jurisdiction.

agreements (including, if applicable, an underwriting agreement in customary
form) and take such other actions as are reasonably required in order to
expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities. The
representations, warranties and covenants of the Company in any underwriting
agreement which are made to or for the benefit of any Underwriters, to the
extent applicable, shall also be made to and for the benefit of the holders of
Registrable Securities included in such registration statement. No holder of
Registrable Securities included in such registration statement shall be
required to make any representations or warranties in the underwriting
agreement except, if applicable, with respect to such holder\'s organization,
good standing, authority, title to Registrable Securities, lack of conflict of
such sale with such holder\'s material agreements and organizational
documents, and with respect to written information relating to such holder
that such holder has furnished in writing expressly for inclusion in such
Registration Statement.

 

3.1.7. _Cooperation. _The principal executive officer of the Company, the
principal financial officer of the Company, the principal accounting officer
of the Company and all other officers and members of the management of the

the event no legal opinion is delivered to any Underwriter, the Company shall
furnish to each holder of Registrable Securities included in such Registration

of counsel to the Company to the effect that the Registration Statement
containing such prospectus has been declared effective and that no stop order
is in effect.

rules and regulations of the Commission and the Securities Act, and make

statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act
and Rule 158 thereunder.

 

3.1.11. _Listing. _The Company shall use its best efforts to cause all
Registrable Securities included in any registration to be listed on such
exchanges or otherwise designated for trading in the same manner as similar
securities issued by the Company are then listed or designated or, if no such
similar securities are then listed or designated, in a manner satisfactory to
the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities included in such
registration.

 

3.2. _Obligation to Suspend Distribution_. Upon receipt of any notice from
the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section
3.1.4(iv), or, in the case of a resale registration on a Shelf Registration
Statement pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof, upon any suspension by the Company,
pursuant to a written insider trading compliance program adopted by the
Company\'s Board of Directors, of the ability of all "insiders" covered by
such program to transact in the Company\'s securities because of the existence
of material non-public information, each holder of Registrable Securities
included in any registration shall immediately discontinue disposition of such
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such
Registrable Securities until such holder receives the supplemented or amended
prospectus contemplated by Section 3.1.4(iv) or the restriction on the ability
of "insiders" to transact in the Company\'s securities is removed, as
applicable, and, if so directed by the Company, each such holder will deliver
to the Company all copies, other than permanent file copies then in such
holder\'s possession, of the most recent prospectus covering such Registrable
Securities at the time of receipt of such notice.

 

3.3. _Registration Expenses_. The Company shall bear all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with any Demand Registration pursuant to Section 2.1,

and expenses of compliance with securities or "blue sky" laws (including fees

G-9

   

(iii) printing expenses; (iv) the Company\'s internal expenses (including,

majority-in-interest of the Registrable Securities included in such
registration. The Company shall have no obligation to pay any underwriting
discounts or selling commissions attributable to the Registrable Securities
being sold by the holders thereof, which underwriting discounts or selling
commissions shall be borne by such holders. Additionally, in an underwritten
offering, all selling stockholders and the Company shall bear the expenses of
the underwriter pro rata in proportion to the respective amount of shares each
is selling in such offering.

 

3.4. _Information_. The holders of Registrable Securities shall provide such
information as may reasonably be requested by the Company, or the managing
Underwriter, if any, in connection with the preparation of any Registration
Statement, including amendments and supplements thereto, in order to effect
the registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act
pursuant to Section 2 and in connection with the Company\'s obligation to
comply with federal and applicable state securities laws.

 

4. _INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION_.

 

4.1. _Indemnification by the Company_. The Company agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless each Investor and each other holder of Registrable Securities,
and each of their respective officers, employees, affiliates, directors,
partners, members, attorneys and agents, and each person, if any, who controls
an Investor and each other holder of Registrable Securities (within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act)
(each, an "Investor Indemnified Party"), from and against any expenses,
losses, judgments, claims, damages or liabilities, whether joint or several,
arising out of or based upon any untrue statement (or allegedly untrue
statement) of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement under
which the sale of such Registrable Securities was registered under the
Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary
prospectus contained in the Registration Statement, or any amendment or
supplement to such Registration Statement, or arising out of or based upon any
omission (or alleged omission) to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any
violation by the Company of the Securities Act or any rule or regulation
promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company and relating to action or
inaction required of the Company in connection with any such registration; and
the Company shall promptly reimburse the Investor Indemnified Party for any
legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred by such Investor Indemnified
Party in connection with investigating and defending any such expense, loss,
judgment, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the
Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such
expense, loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any
untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
made in such Registration Statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus,
or summary prospectus, or any such amendment or supplement, in reliance upon
and in conformity with information furnished to the Company, in writing, by
such selling holder expressly for use therein. The Company also shall
indemnify any Underwriter of the Registrable Securities, their officers,
affiliates, directors, partners, members and agents and each person who
controls such Underwriter on substantially the same basis as that of the
indemnification provided above in this Section 4.1.

 

4.2. _Indemnification by Holders of Registrable Securities_. Each selling
holder of Registrable Securities will, in the event that any registration is
being effected under the Securities Act pursuant to this

 


  

 

G-10

   

Agreement of any Registrable Securities held by such selling holder, indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, each of its directors and officers and each
underwriter (if any), and each other selling holder and each other person, if
any, who controls another selling holder or such underwriter within the
meaning of the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, judgments, damages
or liabilities, whether joint or several, insofar as such losses, claims,
judgments, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of
or are based upon any untrue statement or allegedly untrue statement of a
material fact contained in any Registration Statement under which the sale of
such Registrable Securities was registered under the Securities Act, any
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained in
the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement, or arise out of or are based upon any omission or the alleged
omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading, if the statement or omission
was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in
writing to the Company by such selling holder expressly for use therein, and
shall reimburse the Company, its directors and officers, and each other
selling holder or controlling person for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by any of them in connection with investigation or
defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action. Each selling
holder\'s indemnification obligations hereunder shall be several and not joint
and shall be limited to the amount of any net proceeds actually received by
such selling holder.

 

4.3. _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Promptly after receipt by any
person of any notice of any loss, claim, damage or liability or any action in
respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2, such
person (the "Indemnified Party") shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be
made against any other person for indemnification hereunder, notify such other
person (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of the loss, claim, judgment,
damage, liability or action; provided, however, that the failure by the
Indemnified Party to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability which the Indemnifying Party may have to
such Indemnified Party hereunder, except and solely to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnified
Party is seeking indemnification with respect to any claim or action brought
against the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to participate in such claim or action, and, to the extent that it wishes,
jointly with all other Indemnifying Parties, to assume control of the defense
thereof with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. After notice from
the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to assume
control of the defense of such claim or action, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided, however, that
in any action in which both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
are named as defendants, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel (but no more than one such separate counsel) to represent the
Indemnified Party and its controlling persons who may be subject to liability
arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the
Indemnified Party against the Indemnifying Party, with the fees and expenses
of such counsel to be paid by such Indemnifying Party if, based upon the
written opinion of counsel of such Indemnified Party, representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to entry of judgment
or effect any settlement of any claim or pending or threatened proceeding in
respect of which the Indemnified Party is or could have been a party and
indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such Indemnified Party, unless
such judgment or settlement includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim or proceeding.

 

4.4. _Contribution_.

 

4.4.1. If the indemnification provided for in the foregoing Sections 4.1, 4.2
and 4.3 is unavailable to any Indemnified Party in respect of any loss, claim,
damage, liability or action referred to

 


  

 

G-11

   

herein, then each such Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such
Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage, liability or action
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
Indemnified Parties and the Indemnifying Parties in connection with the
actions or omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability or
action, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
fault of any Indemnified Party and any Indemnifying Party shall be determined
by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by such Indemnified Party or
such Indemnifying Party and the parties\' relative intent, knowledge, access
to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission.

 

4.4.2. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 4.4 were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding Section.

 

4.4.3. The amount paid or payable by an Indemnified Party as a result of any
loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4.4, no holder of Registrable
Securities shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the dollar
amount of the net proceeds (after payment of any underwriting fees, discounts,
commissions or taxes) actually received by such holder from the sale of
Registrable Securities which gave rise to such contribution obligation. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

 

5. _UNDERWRITING AND DISTRIBUTION_.

 

5.1. _Rule 144_. The Company covenants that it shall file any reports
required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
shall take such further action as the holders of Registrable Securities may
reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable
such holders to sell Registrable Securities without registration under the
Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144
under the Securities Act, as such Rules may be amended from time to time, or
any similar Rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the Commission.

 

6. _LOCK-UP_.

 

6.1. _Lock-Up_. Each of the Investors hereby irrevocably agrees that
following the consummation of the Merger, for a period of six (6) months from
the consummation of the Merger with respect to fifty percent (50%) of the
Registrable Securities issued to, or on behalf of, such Investor on the
Closing Date (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and for a period of twelve
(12) months from the consummation of the Merger with respect to the remaining
fifty percent of the Registrable Securities issued to, or on behalf of, such
Investor on the Closing Date (the " _Lock-Up Period End Date_ "), the
Investors and its permitted assigns will not, directly or indirectly:

 

(1) offer for sale, sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of or enter into any
transaction or device that is designed to, or could be expected to, result in
the disposition by any person at any time in the future of such Registrable
Securities;

 


  

 

G-12

   

 (2) enter into any swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers to
another, in whole or in part, any of the economic benefits or risks of
ownership of such Registrable Securities, whether any such transaction is to
be settled by delivery of such Registrable Securities or other securities, in
cash or otherwise; or

 

(3) publicly disclose the intention to do any of the foregoing;

 

provided, that, the provisions of Section 6.1 shall not apply to (a) bona fide
gifts, provided the recipient thereof agrees in writing with the Company to be
bound by the terms of this Section 6.1, (b) in the case of any Investor who is
an individual, dispositions to a member of the immediate family of such
Investor, any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of such Investor and/or
the immediate family of such Investor (or a charitable trust) or any entity
all of whose interests are held by such Investor and/or the immediate family
of such Investor (or entities controlled by such persons), provided that such
trust or other entity agrees in writing with the Company to be bound by the
terms of this Section 6.1, (c) in the case of any Investor who is an
individual, dispositions to any beneficiary of such Investor pursuant to a
will or other testamentary document or applicable laws of descent, provided
that such beneficiary agrees in writing with the Company to be bound to the
terms of this Section 6.1, (d) transactions relating to shares of Common Stock
or other securities acquired in open market transactions after the
consummation of the Merger, (e) with the Companys prior written consent or
(f) the filing of any Registration Statement pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement or the inclusion of any Registrable Securities on any Registration
Statement pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 

7. _MISCELLANEOUS_.

 

7.1. _Other Registration Rights_. The Company represents and warrants that,
with the exception of the Initial Stockholders, no person, other than a holder
of the Registrable Securities, has any right to require the Company to
register any shares of the Company\'s capital stock for sale or to include
shares of the Company\'s capital stock in any registration filed by the
Company for the sale of shares of capital stock for its own account or for the
account of any other person.

rights, duties and obligations of the Company hereunder may not be assigned or

duties and obligations of the holders of Registrable Securities hereunder may
be freely assigned or delegated by such holder of Registrable Securities in
conjunction with and to the extent of any transfer of Registrable Securities
by any such holder. This Agreement and the provisions hereof shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of each of the parties and the permitted
assigns of the Investors or holders of Registrable Securities or of any
assignee of the Investors or holders of Registrable Securities. This
Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or benefits on any persons that
are not party hereto other than as expressly set forth in Article 4 and this
Section 7.2.

transmission is not on a business day or is after normal business hours, then
such notice shall be deemed given on the next business day. Notice otherwise
