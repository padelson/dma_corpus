NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

  

 **ARTICLE I**

  

 **THE MERGER**

  

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall merge with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation in the Merger. The Company, in its capacity as the
corporation surviving the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the
" _Surviving Corporation_."  

   

Section 1.2 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date (as defined in Section
1.7), Parent and the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing a duly executed and delivered certificate of merger as required by the
DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance
with the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the time of such filing, or such
other time as Parent and the Company shall specify in the Certificate of
Merger, being the " _Effective Time_ ").

  

Section 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger
and as specified in the DGCL (including Section 259 of the DGCL).
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
each of the Company and the Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

Section 1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_. At
and after the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub
(the " _Merger Sub Charter_ "), as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, subject to the provisions of Section 6.10, shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until amended in
accordance with the DGCL, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation
shall be "IntraLase Corp."

  

Section 1.5 _Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_.  At and after the
Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Bylaws_ "), as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the provisions of
Section 6.10, shall be the Bylaws of Surviving Corporation, until amended in
accordance with the DGCL, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation
shall be "IntraLase Corp."

  

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

  

(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office
from the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided
by Law.

  

(b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office
from the Effective Time until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided
by Law.

     

   

Section 1.7 _Closing_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m. Los
Angeles Time, at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 300
South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, California on a date to be specified by
Parent and the Company which shall be no later than the third (3rd) business
day after satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in
Article VII (other than the delivery of items to be delivered at Closing and
other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain
subject to the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at the Closing) (the " _Initial Closing Date_ ") or on such other
date and such other time and place as Parent and the Company shall agree in
writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at its election, Parent may delay the
Closing for up to twenty (20) days after the Initial Closing Date, but in no
event may Parent delay the Closing beyond the Outside Date. Such election
shall operate as an irrevocable waiver of the conditions set forth in Section
7.2 hereof and shall be accompanied by the officers certifications referred
to in Section 7.3(a) and 7.3(b) hereof (other than with respect to the
payment of the Merger Consideration), provided that the Company has delivered
to Parent at or prior to the time of such election, the officers
certifications referred to in Section 7.2(a) and 7.2(b) hereof dated as of
the Initial Closing Date. The date on which the Closing shall occur
is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

  

 **ARTICLE II**

  

 **CONVERSION AND EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES**

  

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or any holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any capital stock
of Merger Sub:

  

(a) _Company Common Stock_. Subject to this Article II, each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
2.1(d)(i)) and any shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)),
shall be converted into the right to receive $25.00 in cash without interest
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable upon the surrender of the
Certificates (as defined in Section 2.2(b)). From and after the Effective
Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock, shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate representing any such shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(a).  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, reclassification,
stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, exchange or
other like change with respect to the Company Common Stock occurring (or
having a record date) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time;

  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_.  All shares of
Company Common Stock, that are (i) held by the Company as treasury shares or

     

   

(ii) owned by Parent or any wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined below) of
Parent, in each case immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no securities of Parent
or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.  As used in
this Agreement, the word " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect to any party,
any corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, of which (A) such party or any other Subsidiary of such party
is a general partner, manager or managing member, (B) such party or any
Subsidiary of such party owns in excess of a majority of the outstanding
equity or voting securities or interests or (C) such party or any Subsidiary
of such party has the right to elect at least a majority of the board of
directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such
corporation or other organization; and

  

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and such shares of common stock
issued upon conversion of the Merger Sub Common Stock shall represent all of
the outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation.

  

(d) _Shares of Company Common Stock of Dissenting Stockholders_.

  

(i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, all of
the shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and which are held by holders of Company Common Stock who
shall not have voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing
and who shall have demanded properly in writing an appraisal of the "fair
value" of such Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and
terminated and shall cease to have any rights with respect to Dissenting
Shares other than such rights as are granted pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by holders of Company Common
Stock who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall have
withdrawn or lost their rights for an appraisal of such shares under the DGCL
shall thereupon be deemed to have been cancelled and terminated, as of the
Effective Time, and shall represent solely the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a), upon surrender in the manner
provided in Section 2.2(b), of the certificate or certificates that formerly
evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock.

  

(ii) The Company shall give to Parent prompt written notice of any demands
for appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by
the Company in connection therewith. The Company and Parent shall jointly
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for payment
of fair market value under

     

   

the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any such demands, or
offer to settle, or settle, any such demands. Any amount payable to any
holder of Company Common Stock exercising appraisal rights shall be paid in
accordance with the DGCL solely by the Surviving Corporation out of its own
funds.

  

(e) _Stock Options_.

  

(i) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option entitling the holder
thereof to purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company
Stock Plans, other than the 2004 Employee Plan (each, a " _Company Stock
Option_ " or collectively " _Company Stock Options_ "), to the extent not
already fully vested and exercisable, shall become fully vested and
exercisable immediately prior to consummation of the Merger, but excluding
any Company Stock Options held or beneficially owned by Parent or Merger Sub
or any other Subsidiary or parent of Parent or Merger Sub, and shall be
converted into and shall become the right to receive, in full and complete
satisfaction and cancellation thereof, a cash payment per Company Stock
Option, without interest, in an amount that shall be determined
by multiplying (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the applicable per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option, by (B)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are purchasable on exercise
of such Company Stock Option prior to the Effective Time but subsequent to
any acceleration of vesting provided for in this Section 2.1(e)(i), less
any mandatory tax withholdings (the " _Option Payment_ "). At the Effective
Time, all outstanding Company Stock Options (including any Company Stock
Option for which no payment shall be due hereunder) shall be canceled and be
of no further force or effect except for the right to receive the cash Option
Payment to the extent provided in this Section 2.1(e). Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall take all actions (including,
if appropriate, amending the terms of the Company Stock Plans and related
option agreements) that are necessary to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.1(e).

  

  

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall establish a
procedure to effect the cancellation of Company Stock Options in exchange for
the Option Payments to which the holders of such Company Stock Options shall
be entitled under Section 2.1(e)(i), and, upon cancellation of each such
Company Stock Option, Parent shall pay to the holder thereof in cash promptly
after Closing but in no event more than ten (10) business days after Closing,
the amount of the Option Payment, if any, to which such holder shall be
entitled hereunder, without further action on the part of such holder.

     

   

(iii) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge and agree that
the Surviving Corporation shall not assume or continue any Company Stock
Options, or substitute any additional options for such Company Stock Options.

  

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as Paying Agent
hereunder (the " _Paying Agent_ "). As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with or for the account of the Paying
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock, an amount of
cash sufficient to deliver to the holders of Company Common Stock the Merger
Consideration (such cash, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Fund_ ")
deliverable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock. The Paying Agent shall invest the cash included in the
Fund in obligations guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United
States of America.  All interest earned on such funds shall be paid to
Parent.

  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in no event later than five (5) days thereafter, Parent
will instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") that were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(a) into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify that are consistent with the terms of this
Agreement), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.  Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, after
giving effect to any tax withholdings required by applicable Law, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that,
prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock will
be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to
represent only the right to receive upon surrender the Merger Consideration,
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

     

   

(c) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to Parent any portion of the Fund (including
any interest received with respect thereto) not disbursed to holders
of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only
to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law)
with respect to the Merger Consideration upon due surrender of their
Certificates, without any interest thereon. Neither Parent, Merger Sub nor
the Company shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock, for such
shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Law following the passage of time specified therein. If any
Certificates shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date
on which any payment pursuant to this Article II would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Authority, the Merger
Consideration in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all
claims or interests of any person previously entitled thereto.

  

(d) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person who was a holder
of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time such amounts
as Parent or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect
to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax Law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent.

  

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_.  At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to such time. If, after such
time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such Merger Consideration
as provided in this Article II; _provided_ , _however_ , __ that Parent may,
in its discretion and as a condition precedent thereof, require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement of
indemnification in form satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in such sum as
Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged
to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

     

   

Section 2.3 _Material Adverse Effect_.

  

(a) The term " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any change, effect
or circumstance that (i) is materially adverse to the business, condition
(financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) materially
adversely affects the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that in no event shall any of the following, either alone
or in combination, be deemed to constitute, nor shall any of the following be
taken into account in determining whether there has been or will or could be,
a Company Material Adverse Effect: (A) any changes resulting from or arising
out of general market, economic or political conditions (including any
changes arising out of acts of terrorism, or war, weather conditions or other
force majeure events), provided that such changes do not have a substantially
disproportionate impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, (B) any changes resulting from or arising out of general market,
economic or political conditions in the industries in which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries conduct business (including any changes arising out
of acts of terrorism, or war, weather conditions or other force majeure
events), provided that such changes do not have a
substantially disproportionate impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (C) any changes resulting from or arising out of actions
taken pursuant to (and required by) this Agreement or at the request of
Parent or the failure to take any actions due to restrictions set forth in
this Agreement, (D) any changes in the price or trading volume of the
Companys stock, in and of itself, (E) any failure by the Company to meet
published revenue or earnings projections, in and of itself, (F) any changes
or effects arising out of or resulting from any legal claims or other
proceedings made by any of the Companys stockholders arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the Merger, or (G) any changes arising out of or
resulting from any delay with respect to the receipt by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of pending regulatory approvals relating to its proposed
product offerings of no longer than three months after the date that the
Company has informed Parent it expects to obtain such pending regulatory
approvals (provided that at all times during such period, such approvals are
still pending and can be reasonably expected to be obtained within such
period).

  

(b) The term " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means any change, effect or
circumstance that materially adversely affects the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that in no event shall
any of the following, either alone or in combination, be deemed to
constitute, nor shall any of the following be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or will or could be, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect: (A) any changes resulting from or arising out of general
market, economic or political conditions (including any changes arising out
of acts of terrorism, or war, weather conditions or other force majeure
events), provided that such changes do not have a substantially
disproportionate impact on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B)
any changes resulting from or arising out of general market, economic or
political conditions in the industries in which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries conduct business (including any changes arising out of acts of
terrorism, or war, weather conditions or other force majeure events),
provided that such changes do not have a substantially disproportionate
impact on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (C) any changes
resulting from or arising out of actions taken pursuant to (and required by)
this Agreement or

     

   

at the request of the Company or the failure to take any actions due
to restrictions set forth in this Agreement, (D) any changes in the price
or trading volume of Parents stock, in and of itself, (E) any changes or
effects arising out of or resulting from any legal claims or other
proceedings made by any of Parents stockholders arising out of or related to
this Agreement or the Merger, or (F) any failure by Parent to meet published
revenue or earnings projections, in and of itself.

  

 **ARTICLE III**

  

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**

  

Except as specifically set forth in the written disclosure schedule prepared
by the Company which is dated as of the date of this Agreement and was
previously delivered by the Company to Parent in connection herewith (the "
_Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  

Section 3.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has
the requisite corporate power and authority necessary to own, lease and
operate the properties it purports to own, lease or operate and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to
do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the
character or location of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or
the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing
that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. A true, complete and correct
list of all of the Companys Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of
incorporation of each Subsidiary, the authorized capitalization of each
Subsidiary, and the percentage of each Subsidiarys outstanding capital stock
owned by the Company or another Subsidiary or affiliate of the Company, is
set forth in Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Except as set
forth in Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does
not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any
interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or
similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
joint venture or other business association or entity, excluding securities
in any publicly traded company held for investment by the Company and
comprising less than one percent of the outstanding stock of such publicly
traded company.

  

Section 3.2 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Company
has heretofore made available to Parent a true, complete and correct copy of
its Seventh Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended to
date (the " _Company Charter_ "), and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws,
as amended to date (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), and has furnished to
Parent true, complete and correct copies of the charter and bylaws (or
equivalent organizational documents), each as amended to date, of each of its
Subsidiaries (the " _Subsidiary Documents_ "). The Company Charter, Company
Bylaws and

     

   

the Subsidiary Documents are in full force and effect. The Company is not in
violation of any of the provisions of the Company Charter or Company Bylaws
and the Companys Subsidiaries are not in violation of any of the provisions
of their respective Subsidiary Documents.

  

Section 3.3 _Capitalization_.

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 45,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock (the "
_Preferred Stock_ "). As of December 31, 2006, (i) 28,888,487 shares of
Company Common Stock are issued and outstanding; (ii) 86,151 shares of

Qualified Plan that will result in material liability to the Company. Each
Company Employee Plan which is required to satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or
Section 401(m)(2) of the Code has been tested for compliance with, and
satisfies in all material respects the requirements of Section 401(k)(3) and
Section 401(m)(2) of the Code, as the case may be, for each plan year ending
prior to the Closing Date for which testing is required to be completed.

     

   

(g) Neither the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has (i) ever maintained a Company Employee Plan
which was ever subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA or
(ii) ever been obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined
in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No Company Employee Plan is funded by,
associated with or related to a "voluntary employees
beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

  

(h) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Company Employee Plan is
amendable and terminable unilaterally by the Company and any of the Companys
Subsidiaries party thereto or covered thereby at any time without material
liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result thereof,
other than for benefits accrued as of the date of such amendment or
termination and routine administrative costs.

  

(i) Other than as required under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA, none of the
Company Employee Plans promises or provides health or other welfare benefits
(excluding normal claims for benefits under the Companys group life
insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and disability plans
and policies) or coverage to any person following retirement or other
termination of employment.

  

(j) There is no action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration, audit or
investigation pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened, with
respect to any Company Employee Plan, other than claims for benefits in the
ordinary course.  No Company Employee Plan is or within the last three
calendar years has been the subject of, or has received notice that it is the
subject of, examination by a government agency or a participant in a
government sponsored amnesty, voluntary compliance or similar program.

  

(k) To the Companys Knowledge, each individual who has received compensation
for the performance of services on behalf of the Company, any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has been
properly classified as an employee or independent contractor in accordance
with applicable Law.

  

(l) Each Company Employee Plan maintained or covering employees outside the
United States, and the books and records thereof, is in material compliance
with all applicable Laws of each applicable jurisdiction. Section 3.13(l)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each country in which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates has operations and the number of
employees in each such country.

  

(m) Section 3.13(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of (i) all employment agreements with employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) all employees or former
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who have executed a non-
competition agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) all
severance agreements, programs and policies of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with or relating to its employees, excluding programs and
policies required to be maintained by Law; and (iv) all plans, programs,
agreements and other arrangements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to which payments

     

   

(or acceleration of benefits or vesting of options or lapse of repurchase
rights) may be required upon, or may become payable directly or indirectly as
a result of or in connection with, the negotiation or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by, or the execution of, this Agreement. True,
complete and correct copies of each of the foregoing agreements to which any
employee of the Company is a party have been made available to Parent.

  

(n) All contributions required to be made with respect to any Company
Employee Plan on or prior to the Effective Time have been or will be timely
made or are reflected on the Balance Sheet. There are no pending, or, to the
Companys Knowledge, threatened or reasonably anticipated claims by or on
behalf of any Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any such
Company Employee Plan, or otherwise involving any such Plan (other than
routine claims for benefits).

  

(o) Except as set forth as Section 3.13(o) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the negotiation or consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event,
(i) entitle any current or former employee or officer of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company to severance pay, or any other payment from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, a lapse of repurchase rights or increase the amount of compensation
due any such employee or officer. There is no Company Employee Plan or other
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that, individually or collectively,
could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible
pursuant to Sections 280G (determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of
the Code) or 162(m) of the Code.

  

(p) Each Company Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated since
January 1, 2005 in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and
IRS Notice 2005-1. No Company Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" has been materially modified (as determined under Notice
2005-1) after October 3, 2004. No award granted under any of the Company
Stock Plans is subject to Section 409A of the Code.

  

Section 3.14 _Labor Matters_.

  

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are and have been in compliance
in all material respects with all applicable Laws respecting employment and
employment practices, including, without limitation, all Laws respecting
terms and conditions of employment, health and safety, wages and hours, child
labor, immigration, employment discrimination, disability rights or benefits,
equal opportunity, plant closures and layoffs, affirmative action, workers
compensation, labor relations, employee leave issues and unemployment
insurance.  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is delinquent
in payments to any current or former employees for any services or amounts
required to be reimbursed or otherwise paid.  Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to, or otherwise bound by, any order, writ,
judgment, injunction,

     

   

decree, stipulation, determination or award relating to employees or
employment practices entered by or with any Governmental Entity.

  

(b) All personnel policies, rules and procedures applicable to employees of
the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries are in writing. There are no
written personnel manuals, handbooks, policies, rules or
procedures applicable to employees of the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than those set forth in Section 3.14(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, true and complete copies of which have heretofore been
provided to Parent.

  

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received (i) notice
of any unfair labor practice charge or complaint pending or threatened before
the National Labor Relations Board or any other Governmental Entity against
them, (ii) notice of any complaints, grievances or arbitrations arising out
of any collective bargaining agreement or any other complaints, grievances or
arbitration proceedings against them, (iii) notice of any charge or complaint
with respect to or relating to them pending before the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission or any other Governmental Entity responsible for the
prevention of unlawful employment practices, (iv) notice of the intent of any
Governmental Entity responsible for the enforcement of labor, employment,
wages and hours of work, child labor, immigration, or occupational safety and
health Laws to conduct an investigation with respect to or relating to them
or notice that such investigation is in progress, or (v) notice of any
complaint, lawsuit or other proceeding pending or threatened in any forum by
or on behalf of any present or former employees, any applicant for employment
or classes of the foregoing alleging breach of any express or implied
contract of employment, any applicable Law governing employment or the
termination thereof or other discriminatory, wrongful or tortious conduct in
connection with the employment relationship.

  

(d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has good labor relations, and
the Company, each of its Subsidiaries, and their respective employees, agents
or representatives have not committed any material unfair labor practice as
defined in the National Labor Relations Act. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to, bound by or subject to (and none of the
Companys and/or any of its Subsidiaries properties or assets is bound by or
subject to) any labor agreement, collective bargaining agreement, work rules
or practices, or any other labor-related agreements or arrangements with any
labor union, labor organization, trade union or works council. There are no
labor agreements, collective bargaining agreements, work rules or practices,
or any other labor-related agreements or arrangements that pertain to any of
the employees of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, and no employees
of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries are represented by any labor
union, labor organization, trade union or works council with respect to their
employment with the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries.

  

(e) To the Companys Knowledge, there are no current labor union organizing
activities with respect to any employees of the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries.  No labor union, labor organization, trade union, works
council, or group of employees of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries
has made a pending demand for

     

   

recognition or certification, and there are no representation or
certification proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding
presently pending or threatened in writing to be brought or filed with the
National Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations tribunal or
authority. To the Companys Knowledge, there are no labor disputes, strikes,
slowdowns, work stoppages, lockouts, or threats thereof, against or affecting
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor has there been any of the
foregoing during the 5-year period before the date of this Agreement.

  

(f) No employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) to the
Companys Knowledge is in violation of any term of any patent disclosure
agreement, non-competition agreement, or any restrictive covenant to a former
employer relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries because of the nature of the business
conducted or presently proposed to be conducted by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or relating to the use of trade secrets or
proprietary information of others, or (ii) in the case of any key employee or
group of key employees, has given notice as of the date of this Agreement to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that such employee or any employee in
a group of key employees intends to terminate his or her employment with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether on account of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or for any other reason.

  

(g) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are and have been in compliance
with all notice and other requirements under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended (the " _WARN Act_ "), and any
similar foreign, state or local Law relating to plant closings and layoffs.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently engaged in any
layoffs or employment terminations sufficient in number to trigger
application of the WARN Act or any similar state, local or foreign Law.
 Section 3.14(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true
and complete list of the names and the sites of employment or facilities of
those individuals who suffered an "employment loss" (as defined in the WARN
Act) at any site of employment or facility of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries during the 90-day period prior to the date of this Agreement.
Section 3.14(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be updated
immediately prior to the Closing with respect to the 90-day period prior to
the Closing.

  

(h) The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with
any other event, result in any material breach or other violation of any
collective bargaining agreement, employment agreement, consulting agreement
or any other labor-related agreement to which the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party.

  

Section 3.15 _Properties; Encumbrances_.

  

(a) Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has good and valid title
to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all the properties and assets which it
purports to own or lease (real, tangible, personal and mixed), including all
the properties and assets reflected in the Balance Sheet (except for personal
property sold since the date of the Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice). All

     

   

properties and assets reflected in the Balance Sheet are free and clear of
all Liens, except for Liens reflected on the Balance Sheet and Liens for
current taxes not yet due and other Liens that do not materially detract from
the value or impair the use of the property or assets subject thereto.

  

(b) Section 3.15(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of all real property owned by the Company and each

Property Leases_ ") have been delivered to or made available to Parent.
Section 3.15(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all Real Property
Leases.

  

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, the Owned Real Property and the Leased
Real Property constitute all of the real property used by the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries in the operation of the business of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries, and such Owned Real Property and Leased Real
Property taken together are sufficient for the conduct of the business of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.

  

(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.15(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no person other than the Company and its applicable Subsidiaries
has any right (whether by lease, sublease, license or otherwise) to use or
occupy all or any portion of the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real
Property.

  

(f) True, complete and correct copies of all title policies and surveys in
the possession or control of Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to
the Owned Real Property and the Leased Real Property have been delivered to

there are no breaches, defaults or violations of any material obligations of
the landlord under any Real Property Lease.

  

Section 3.16 _Taxes_.

  

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Tax_ " or " _Taxes_ " shall mean
taxes, fees, assessments, liabilities, levies, duties, tariffs, imposts and
governmental impositions or charges of any kind in the nature of (or similar
to) taxes, payable to any federal, state, local or foreign taxing authority,
or any agency or subdivision thereof, including (i) income, franchise,

Balance Sheet are adequate to cover all Taxes accruable through the
date thereof (including interest and penalties, if any, thereon and Taxes
being contested) in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis with
the Balance Sheet. All liabilities for Taxes attributable to the period
commencing on the date following the date of the Balance Sheet were incurred
in the ordinary course of business and are consistent in type and amount with
Taxes attributable to similar prior periods.

  

(c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have timely withheld with

has ever been a member of an affiliated group of corporations within the
meaning of Section 1504 of the Code. The Company nor any of its Subsidiaries

successor, by contract or otherwise.

  

(d) The Company made available to Parent complete and correct copies of all

otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in connection with the
Merger.

  

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any tax shelter arrangement as described in
Internal Revenue Service final regulations (T.D. 9046).

  

(j) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all material
respects with Section 482 of the Code and any similar state, local, or

Knowledge threatened claim, action, investigation or notice by any person or
entity alleging potential liability for investigatory, cleanup or

any location owned or operated by the Company or its Subsidiaries, now or in
the past, or (ii) any violation, or alleged violation, of any Environmental
Law (collectively, " _Environmental Claims_ "), except where such
Environmental Claims would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or otherwise require disclosure in the SEC Reports;

could reasonably be expected to form the basis of any Environmental Claim
against the Company or its Subsidiaries or against any person or entity whose

Intellectual Property (" _Outbound Intellectual Property Licenses_ "); or
(iii) restricting the Companys or any of its Subsidiarys rights, or

enforceable by or against the parties thereto in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,

proceeding in equity or at Law).

(i) Except as set forth in Section 3.18(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there is no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened (and

there been pending any) material suit, arbitration or other adversarial
proceeding before any court, government agency or arbitral tribunal or in any
jurisdiction alleging that any activities or conduct of the Companys or any
of its Subsidiaries business infringes or will infringe upon, violate or
constitute the unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property rights of any
third party or challenging the ownership, validity, enforceability or
registerability of any Intellectual Property owned by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. The Company is not party to any settlements, covenants not
to sue, consents, decrees, stipulations, judgments, or orders resulting from
suits, actions or similar legal proceedings which (i) restrict the Companys
or any of its Subsidiaries rights to use any Intellectual Property owned by
and material to the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted, (ii) restrict the conduct of the business of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted in order to accommodate any
third partys Intellectual Property rights, or (iii) permit third

     

   

parties to use any Intellectual Property owned by the business of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.

  

(j) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Companys and its Subsidiaries
business and operations as currently conducted do not infringe upon, violate
or constitute the unauthorized use of any Intellectual Property rights owned
by any third party. There has been no such claim asserted or threatened in
the past three (3) years against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or,
to the Knowledge of the Company or its Subsidiaries, any other person.

  

(k) All former and current employees of the Company and each Subsidiary have
executed written agreements that assign to the Company and applicable
Subsidiary all rights to any inventions, improvements, discoveries, or
information relating to the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries. To
the Companys Knowledge, no employee of the Company or any Subsidiary has
entered into any Contract that restricts or limits in any way the scope or
type of work in which the employee may be engaged or requires the employee to

through a chain of title, valid written assignments from all consultants,
employees and third parties who contributed to the creation or development of
all other Intellectual Property for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ("
_Inventors_ "), of the rights to such contributions that the Company or any
Subsidiary does not already own by operation of law, pursuant to which the
Company is the sole owner of all such contributions and consequently the sole
owner of all rights therein. The Inventors have not made any filings for or
asserted to the Company that they intend to secure rights or, to
the Knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, otherwise taken any
steps to secure or acquire any rights to Intellectual Property inconsistent
with the assignments referred to above in this Section 3.18(l). No Inventor,
nor any person involved with the Intellectual Property on behalf of the
Company or other owner of the Intellectual Property, has challenged or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened to challenge, the validity or
enforceability of the Intellectual Property or the Licensed Intellectual
Property.

  

(m) To the Companys Knowledge, the Licensed Intellectual Property listed in
Section 3.18(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule is owned by a valid chain
of title by the entity which granted the licensed rights to the Company or
the applicable Subsidiary, or the entity which granted the licensed rights
otherwise had sufficient rights to grant those licensed rights to the Company
or the applicable Subsidiary. To the Companys Knowledge, no inventor or
other person involved with the Licensed Intellectual Property has challenged
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened to challenge, the validity or
enforceability of the Licensed Intellectual Property.

  

(n) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures to
protect the proprietary nature of the Intellectual Property owned by the

     

   

Company or such Subsidiary that is material to the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, including requiring all
employees, consultants, contractors, and any other person having access
thereto to execute written non-disclosure agreements.

  

(o) To the Companys Knowledge, no third party is misappropriating,
infringing, diluting or violating any intellectual property owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is material to the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted. No Intellectual Property
misappropriation, infringement dilution or violation suits, arbitrations or
other adversarial proceedings have been brought before any court, government
agency or arbitral tribunal against any third party by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries which remain unresolved.

  

(p) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) granted or is
obligated to grant access to any of its source code contained in any material
proprietary product currently being marketed, sold, licensed or developed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each such product, a " _Proprietary
Product_ "), (ii) made its source code contained in any Proprietary Product
subject to any open source license, or (iii) licensed or has the right to
obtain any source code, object code or any open license of any third party
contained in any Proprietary Product (including in any such case any
conditional right to access or under which the Company has established any
escrow arrangement for the storage and conditional release of any source
code, object code or open license).

  

(q) None of the Proprietary Products contains any third party software code
that is, in whole or in part, subject to the provisions of any open source or
quasi-open source license agreement under which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is obligated to make the source code for such Proprietary
Product generally available to the public.

  

(r) The Company does not have any obligation to pay any third party any
royalties or other fees in excess of $1 million in the aggregate in any
calendar year for the use of Intellectual Property and no obligation to pay
such royalties or other fees will result from the execution and delivery by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(s) The Company and each Subsidiary has complied in all material respects
with, and is not in breach nor, except as set forth in Section 3.18(s) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, has received any asserted or threatened claim of
breach of, any Intellectual Property Contract, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries have no Knowledge of any breach or anticipated breach by any
other person to any Intellectual Property Contract, nor will the consummation
by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby result in any loss or
impairment of ownership by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of, or the
right of any of them to use, any Intellectual Property that is material to
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, nor,
to the Companys Knowledge, require the consent of any Governmental Entity or
third party with respect to any such Intellectual Property. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any

     

   

agreement under which a third party would be entitled to receive or expand a
license or any other right to any material Intellectual Property of Parent or
any of Parents affiliates as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

Section 3.19 _Products_.

  

(a) With respect to the use of software in the business of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries as such business is currently conducted, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no such software contains defects in its operation
or any device or feature designed to disrupt, disable, or otherwise
materially impair the functioning of any software. There have been no material
security breaches in any of the Companys or Subsidiaries information
technology systems, and there have been no disruptions in any of the
Companys or Subsidiaries information technology systems that materially
adversely affected such Companys or Subsidiaries business or operations.
 The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have evaluated their
disaster recovery and backup needs and have implemented plans and systems
that reasonably address their assessment of risk.

  

(b) The products licensed, sold, leased and delivered and all services
provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries conform in all material
respects with all applicable contractual commitments and all express
warranties, the Companys published product specifications and with all
regulations, certification standards and other requirements of any applicable
Governmental Entity or third party.  All Proprietary Products and other
products licensed, sold, leased and delivered by the Company are free of any
material defects. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any liability
(whether known or unknown, whether asserted or unasserted, whether absolute
or contingent, whether accrued or unaccrued, whether liquidated or
unliquidated, and whether due or to become due) for replacement or
modification of any such products or other damages in connection
therewith, other than in the ordinary course of business.  There are no
defects in the design or technology embodied in any products marketed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which materially impair or are likely to
materially impair the intended use of the product. Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.11, there is no presently pending, or, to the Knowledge of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, threatened, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, there is no basis for, any material
civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, demands, claims, hearings,
notices of violation, investigations, proceedings or demand letters relating
to any alleged hazard or alleged defect in design, manufacture, materials or
workmanship, including any failure to warn or alleged breach of express or
implied warranty or representation, relating to any product produced,
distributed or sold by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has extended to
any of its customers any written, non-uniform product warranties,
indemnifications or guarantees.

  

(c) No product or product component manufactured and/or distributed by the
Company, or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, by

Subsidiaries, is (i) adulterated within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. Section 351;
or (ii) misbranded within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. Section 352. Section 3.19

safety alerts material to the operations of the Company or reportable to the
FDA with respect to products manufactured and/or distributed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or by any third party on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, in each case between October 6, 2004 and the date of
this Agreement, and the dates, if any, such recalls, field notifications,
field corrections and safety alerts were resolved or closed, and (ii) to the
Knowledge of the Company, any material complaints with respect to products
produced by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or by any third party on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, that are open as of the
date of this Agreement. There are no outstanding field recalls,
field notifications, field corrections or safety alerts material to the
operations of the Company or reportable to the FDA with respect to the
products manufactured and/or distributed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or by any third party on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and to the Companys Knowledge, there are no facts that would

or liabilities incurred in connection with its incorporation or organization
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and except for this
Agreement and any other agreements or arrangements contemplated by this

similar Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights
generally and by general equitable principles (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).

 **ARTICLE VI**

  

 **ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

  

Section 6.1 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, auditors and agents to) afford to Parent and
to Parents officers, employees, financial advisors, legal counsel,
accountants, consultants and other representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to
all of its books and records (other than privileged documents or documents or
information the disclosure of which is not permitted by applicable Law or
order of any Governmental Entity) and its properties, plants and personnel.
During such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent a copy of
each report, schedule and other document filed or received by it pursuant to
the requirements of federal securities Laws. No investigation or receipt of
information pursuant to this Section 6.1 shall affect any representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the Company (or remedies with respect
thereto) or any matter set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the
conditions to the obligations of the Company under this Agreement. Each party
agrees that it (and its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
representatives) shall hold in confidence all non-public information acquired
from the other party or the other partys representatives in accordance with
the terms of the Bilateral Agreement for Non-Use and Non-Disclosure of
Confidential Information effective August 2, 2006 between Parent and the
Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  

Section 6.2 _No Solicitation_.

  

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall direct each of their respective affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives (including any investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative
retained by any of them or any of their respective Subsidiaries) to (i)
immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any other parties that
may be ongoing with respect to the possibility or consideration of any
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) not release any third party from, or waive any
provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. From
the date of this Agreement through the Effective

     

   

Time, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, nor
shall it authorize or permit any of its or its Subsidiaries directors,
officers or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant or other representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries
to, directly or indirectly through another person, (w) solicit, initiate,
facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information or
assistance), any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (x) participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, (y) make
or authorize any statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any
Acquisition Proposal or (z) enter into or execute any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement or
similar agreement constituting or relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement entered into in the circumstances referred
to and consistent with the provisions of Section 6.2(b)).

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board or a special committee
formed by the Company Board (a " _Special Committee_ ") shall be permitted,
prior to the Stockholders Meeting to be held pursuant to Section 6.4, and
subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 6.2 and to first
entering into a confidentiality agreement having provisions that are no less
favorable to such party than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, to engage in discussions and negotiations with, and provide any
information or data to, any person in response to an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal by such person made after the date of this
Agreement that the Company Board or Special Committee reasonably determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisors) constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal.

  

(i) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than one
business day) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for
nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by
any person that informs the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that it is
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry from
any person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with the Company
relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall be
made orally and confirmed in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the
person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the material
terms and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy
thereof if in writing and any related documentation or correspondence). The
Company shall also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify Parent,
orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations
concerning any Acquisition Proposal or provides information or data to any
person in accordance with this Section 6.2(b) and keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, discussions
or negotiations, including by providing a copy of all material documentation
or correspondence relating thereto.

  

(ii) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its

     

   

stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure if the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that the failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely
to be a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that compliance with such rules or Law shall not in any way limit
or modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules has under
any other provision of this Agreement, including Section 8.3.

  

(c) Nothing in this Section 6.2 shall (x) permit the Company to terminate
this Agreement other than with respect to a Superior Proposal or (y) affect
any other obligation of the Company under this Agreement. The Company shall
not submit to the vote of its stockholders at or prior to the Stockholders
Meeting any Acquisition Proposal other than the Voting Proposal.

  

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means
any inquiry, proposal or offer, filing of any regulatory application or
notice (whether in draft or final form) or disclosure of an intention to do
any of the foregoing from any person relating to any (w) direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes a substantial portion
of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company or any of its
"significant subsidiaries" (as defined in Rule 1-02 under Regulation S-X of
the Securities Act), (x) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of any
class of equity securities representing 15% or more of the voting power of
the Company or any of its significant subsidiaries, (y) tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person beneficially
owning 15% or more of the voting power of the Company, or (z) merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and any transaction by the Company permitted by Section 5.1
hereof.

  

(e) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

  

(i) except as set forth in this Section 6.2 or required by Rule 14(e)-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act, withdraw or modify, or propose publicly
to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval or
recommendation by the Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby (any such withdrawal, amendment,
modification or proposal, a " _Change of Recommendation_ "); or

  

(ii) except as set forth in this Section 6.2, adopt, approve or recommend to
its stockholders that they accept, or propose publicly to adopt, approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.

     

   

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board or Special Committee may, in
response to a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 6.2(f)) that did not
result from a breach by the Company of this Section 6.2, effect a Change of
Recommendation and/or in the case of a tender or exchange offer made directly
to its stockholders, recommend that its stockholders accept the tender or
exchange offer and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g), if
(A) the Superior Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and
continues to be a Superior Proposal; (B) the Company Board or Special
Committee determines in good faith, after receipt of advice of outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action could reasonably be expected to
result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders under
applicable Law, but only at a time that is prior to the Stockholders Meeting
and is after the fifth (5th) business day following the receipt by Parent of
written notice advising Parent that the Company Board desires to take such
action due to the existence of a Superior Proposal, specifying the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the person or
persons making such Superior Proposal; and (C) the Company shall have
complied with this Section 6.2 in all material respects and shall not have
breached in any material respect the provisions set forth in Section 6.3,
Section 6.4 or Section 6.5.

  

(f) If Parent makes a counterproposal to a Superior Proposal, the Company
shall consider and cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate on its
behalf in good faith with respect to the terms of such counterproposal during
the five (5) business day period contemplated in Section 6.2(e).  For
purposes of this Agreement, a " _Superior Proposal_ " means any Acquisition
Proposal on terms which the Company Board determines in its good faith
judgment (after consultation with an independent financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel), taking
into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal (including
the potential value of the consideration stockholders would receive at the
time of closing of the Superior Proposal) and this Agreement (including any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement) to be more favorable
from a financial point of view to the Companys stockholders (in their
capacities as stockholders) than the Merger, to have a reasonable likelihood
of closing in a timely manner, and for which financing, to the extent
required, is then committed.

  

Section 6.3 _Proxy Statement_.

  

(a) The Company will, as expeditiously as practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, but in no event later than fifteen (15) calendar days from
the date hereof in connection with its initial filing, prepare and file with
the SEC the proxy statement and any amendments or supplements thereto
relating to the Stockholder Meeting to be held in connection with the Merger
(the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the
Company in the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement. The Company will
provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Proxy Statement prior to filing. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly thereafter
as practicable. The Company shall, as expeditiously as practicable after the
receipt thereof, provide to Parent copies of any written comments and advise
Parent of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received from
the staff of the SEC and (subject to its obligation in the next

     

   

sentence) to respond to such comments as expeditiously as practicable. The
Company will provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement prior to filing
with the SEC and will provide Parent with a copy of all such filings with the
SEC.  The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders at the earliest practicable
date.

  

(b) Except for information relating solely to Parent and Merger Sub and that
is provided by Parent or Merger Sub, the Company covenants that the Proxy
Statement will not, at the date mailed to stockholders of the Company and at
the time of the Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If at any
time prior to the Effective Time any event with respect to the Company, its
officers or directors or any of its subsidiaries should occur which is
required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy
Statement, the Company shall promptly so advise Parent and such event shall
be so described, and such amendment or supplement (which Parent shall have a
reasonable opportunity to review) shall be promptly filed with the SEC and,
as required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. The
Proxy Statement, insofar as it relates to the Stockholder Meeting, will
comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.

  

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub covenants that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date mailed to stockholders and at the time of the
Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Stockholder
Meeting any event with respect to Parent, its officers or directors or any of
its subsidiaries should occur which is required to be described in
an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, Parent shall
promptly so advise the Company of such event in sufficient detail to allow
the Company to prepare and file any such amendment or supplement.

  

Section 6.4 _Stockholders Meeting_.

  

(a) Subject to Section 6.2, the Company shall take all actions in accordance
with applicable Law, the NASDAQ Global Market, the Company Charter and the
Company Bylaws to promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within forty five (45) days after
the clearance of the Proxy Statement, its Stockholders Meeting for the
purpose of considering and voting upon the approval of the Voting Proposal.
 Subject to Section 6.2, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
(i) the Company Board shall recommend approval of the Voting Proposal by the
stockholders of the Company and include such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement and (ii) neither the Company Board, nor any committee
thereof, shall effect a Change of Recommendation.  Subject to Section 6.2,
the Company shall use its reasonable

     

   

best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
Voting Proposal, and to secure the votes or consents of the stockholders that
are required by the rules of the NASDAQ Global Market or the DGCL.

  

(b) The Company shall call, give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders
Meeting in accordance with this Section 6.4. Unless the Company terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(g), the Company shall submit the
Voting Proposal to its stockholders for the purpose of acting upon such
proposal whether or not (i) the Company Board at any time subsequent to the
date of this Agreement determines, in the manner permitted by Section 6.2(e),
that the proposal is no longer advisable or recommends that the stockholders
of the Company reject such proposal, or (ii) any actual, potential or
purported Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal has been
commenced, disclosed, announced or submitted to the Company. The Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that all proxies solicited in
connection with its Stockholders Meeting are solicited, in compliance with
the DGCL, the NASDAQ Global Market, the Company Charter and the Company
Bylaws and all other applicable legal requirements. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after receiving
written consent of the Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Stockholders
Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to its stockholders or, if as of
the time for which the Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholders Meeting.

  

(c) Following the Stockholders Meeting and at or prior to the Closing, the
Company shall deliver to the Corporate Secretary of the Parent a certificate
setting forth the voting results from the Stockholders Meeting.

  

Section 6.5 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Each of Parent and, subject to
Section 6.2, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to comply
promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed with respect to the
Merger (which efforts shall include furnishing all information required under
the HSR Act and in connection with approvals of or filings with any other
Governmental Entity) and will promptly cooperate with and furnish information
to the other in connection with any such requirements imposed upon any of
them or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger.  Each of
Parent and the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, take all
reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and will cooperate with the other in
obtaining) any clearance, consent, authorization, order or approval of, or
any exemption by, any Governmental Entity required to be obtained or made by
Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with
the Merger or the taking of any action contemplated thereby or by
this Agreement. In connection with the actions and procedures referenced in
this Section 6.5, the Company shall (i) promptly and fully inform Parent of
any written or oral communication received from or given to any Governmental
Entity, (ii) permit Parent to review in advance any submission to any
Governmental Entity, (iii) consult with Parent in advance of any meeting,
conference or discussion with any Governmental Entity, and (iv) if permitted
to do so by the relevant Governmental Entity, give Parent the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings,

     

   

conferences and discussions. Any materials, consultations or meetings and
the information contained or discussed therein provided to or discussed with
any Governmental Entity by the Company shall be given only to or shall be
available to participation only by the outside legal counsel of Parent and
will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to non-legal department
employees, officers, or directors of Parent unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the Company or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Parent, the Company nor any of their respective affiliates
shall be required to (i) sell or dispose of or hold separately (through a
trust or otherwise) any assets or businesses or interests in any assets or
businesses of Parent, the Company or their respective affiliates or make any
other change in any portion of the businesses of the Company or Parent or
incur any other limitation on the conduct of the businesses of the Company or
Parent to obtain such clearances, consents, authorizations, orders, approvals
and exemptions or agree to do, or submit to orders providing for, any of the
foregoing, in each case whether before or after the Effective Time, or (ii)
if any Governmental Entity that has the authority to enforce any Antitrust
Law seeks, or authorizes its staff to seek, a preliminary injunction or
restraining order to enjoin consummation of the Merger, take or agree to take
any action which Parent reasonably believes would be prohibited or restricted
under such preliminary injunction or restraining order.

  

Section 6.6 _Public Announcements_.

  

(a) Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release or making any public statement with respect to the Merger or
this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement without the prior written consent of the other party, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ _,_
that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such
press release or make such public statement as may upon the written advice of
counsel be required by Law or the rules and regulations of the NYSE or NASDAQ
Global Market (as applicable) if it has used all reasonable best efforts to
consult with the other party prior thereto and provided, further, that,
following a Change of Recommendation, no such consultation or agreement shall
be required.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or
the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties (and each employee, representative
or other agent of the parties) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and any facts that may be relevant
to the tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby beginning on the
date of the execution of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this Section 6.6(b) shall permit either party (or any employee,
representative or agent thereof) to disclose (A) any information that is not
necessary to understand the tax treatment and tax structure of such
transactions (including the identity of the parties and any information that
could lead another to determine the identity of the parties), or (B) any
other information to the extent that such disclosure could result in a
violation of any applicable Law.

Section 6.7 _Employee Benefits; 401(k) Plan_.

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, recognize the prior service with the Company or its
Subsidiaries of each employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time (the " _Company Employees_ ") in connection with all employee
benefit plans, programs or policies (including vacation) of Parent or its
affiliates in which Company Employees are eligible to participate following
the Effective Time, for purposes of eligibility and vesting.  From and after
the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall provide Company
Employees for so long as such Company Employees remain so employed, health
and welfare benefits pursuant to employee benefit plans, programs, policies
or arrangements maintained by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent providing
coverage and benefits which are no less favorable than those provided to
employees of Parent in positions comparable to positions held by Company
Employees with Parent or its Subsidiaries from time to time after
the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will
cause the Surviving Corporation to cause any pre-existing conditions or
limitations and eligibility waiting periods (to the extent that such waiting
periods would be inapplicable, taking into account service with the Company)
under any group health plans of Parent or its affiliates to be waived with
respect to Company Employees and their eligible dependents.

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as
Parent may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving Corporation to
effect such actions relating to the Company 401(k) Plan (the " _401(k) Plan_
") as Parent may deem necessary or appropriate (after reasonable consultation
with the Company), including terminating the 401(k) Plan prior to the
Effective Time, subject to the terms of the 401(k) Plan and applicable Law
and provided that such action does not preclude the immediate participation
of the Company Employees in any successor plan.

  

(c) Parent shall maintain in effect the IntraLase Corp. Executive
Nonqualified Excess Plan, for the sole purpose of accepting deferrals and
paying benefits to existing participants in such Plan, until all deferrals
and payments as elected by such participants in respect of amounts paid or
payable to them by or on behalf of the Company have been made in accordance
with the elections made prior to and as of the Effective Time on such
participants deferral agreement.

  

Section 6.8 _2004 Employee Stock Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all necessary and appropriate actions so that all
outstanding purchase rights under the 2004 Employee Plan shall automatically
be exercised, in accordance with the terms of such plan, prior to the
Effective Time, and the shares of Company Common Stock purchased under those
exercised rights shall at the Effective Time be cancelled and converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a) of
this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
necessary and appropriate actions so that the 2004 Employee Plan shall
terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time, and no further
purchase rights shall be granted under the 2004 Employee Plan. Employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who continue in the employ of the Surviving
Corporation or Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent after the Effective Time
shall be eligible for participation in Parents Employee Stock Purchase Plan
within 60 days following the Effective Time.

     

   

Section 6.9 _Consents_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals under any of the
Material Contracts and Real Property Leases in connection with the Merger.

  

Section 6.10 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide
indemnification and exculpation for each person who is now or has been prior
to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") which is at least as favorable to such person as the exculpation
and indemnification provided to the Indemnified Parties by the Company and
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time in the applicable
Company Charter, Company Bylaws, Subsidiary Documents and the indemnification
agreements set forth in Section 6.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule that
each Indemnified Party has with the Company, as in effect on the date hereof.

  

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect, the current policies of the Companys directors and
officers and fiduciary liability insurance (the " _D andO Policy_") covering
acts or omissions prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons
who are currently covered by the Companys DandO Policy; _provided_ , that
Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to
former officers and directors of the Company; _provided_ _further_ ,
that Parent shall not be required to pay any annual premium for the DandO
Policy in excess of 200% of the annual premium to be in effect after the date
hereof; and _provided_ _further_ that if the premium for such
coverage exceeds such amount, Parent shall purchase the DandO Policy with the
greatest coverage available for such 200% amount.

  

(c) The obligations under this Section 6.10 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person to
whom this Section 6.10 applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Person (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Person to
whom this Section 6.10 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 6.10), and in the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation
consolidates or merges with any other person and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or
transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any other person, then
parent shall make proper provision so that the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity, or transferee of such assets, as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.10.

  

Section 6.11 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Additional Agreements_.

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company agrees to cooperate fully with each other and to use reasonable
best

     

   

efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, at the time and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the
Merger, including using reasonable best efforts to lift or rescind any
injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the
ability of the parties to consummate the Merger.

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.11(a), from the date hereof
until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its officers, employees, representatives and advisors,
including legal and accounting, to provide such cooperation as is reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of the financing
necessary to consummate the Merger, including, (a) causing appropriate
officers and employees to be available, on a customary basis and on
reasonable advance notice, to meet with prospective lenders and investors in
meetings, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions, management
presentations, road shows and sessions with rating agencies, (b) assisting
with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, business
projections and financial statements, and assisting Parent in preparing
offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents, and (c) requesting its independent accountants to provide
reasonable assistance to Parent, including requesting such accountants to
provide consent to Parent to prepare and use their audit reports relating to
the Company and any necessary "comfort letters." Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, there is no financing
contingency to the Closing of the Merger. In the event that the conditions
set forth in Article VII are satisfied or waived prior to the Outside Date,
then Parent shall be obligated to close the Merger and pay the Merger
Consideration, and its failure to do so, as a result of its inability
or failure to obtain necessary financing, shall be deemed a breach of
this Agreement for which the Company shall be entitled to pursue whatever
remedies it may have at law or equity without any limitation, except as
imposed by law, on its ability to seek damages or other relief (or the amount
of such damages or relief). Parent covenants and agrees that it shall not
assert or be entitled to assert as a defense against any such claim of breach
of contract for Parents inability or failure to obtain necessary financing
that it exercised best or other efforts to obtain necessary financing to
close the transaction.

  

(c) In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the
proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their
respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be
reasonably requested by Parent.

  

(d) The Company shall not send any written communications to its employees
regarding the Merger or this Agreement without receiving the prior written
consent of Parent with respect to such written communications, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld.

  

Section 6.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent,
upon any

     

   

director or officer of Parent or the Company (as applicable) becoming aware
of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or
failure to occur would be reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions
set forth in Article VII not to be satisfied.  Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 6.12, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 6.12 will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such
partys obligation to consummate the Merger.

  

Section 6.13 _Takeover Statutes_. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement, in no event shall the approval of the Merger and this
Agreement by the Company Board under Section 203 of the DGCL be withdrawn,
revoked or modified by the Company Board. If any Takeover Statute is or may
become applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Company and the Company Board shall promptly grant
such approvals and take such lawful actions as are necessary so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger, as the case may be, and
otherwise take such lawful actions to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such statute, and any regulations promulgated thereunder, on such
transactions.

  

Section 6.14 _Current Information_. During the period from the date of
this Agreement to the Effective Time, each party will cause one or more of
its designated representatives to confer on a regular and frequent basis
with representatives of the other party and to report the general status of
the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company will
promptly notify Parent of any material change in the normal course of
business or in the operation of the properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and of any governmental complaints, investigations or hearings
(or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the
institution or the threat of significant litigation involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, and will keep Parent fully informed of such events.
On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide a schedule of
all issued patents disclosed in Section 3.18(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule that are subject to maintenance fees or taxes or actions falling due
prior to September 30, 2007.

  

Section 6.15 _Stock Delisting_. The parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to cause the Company Common Stock
to be delisted from the NASDAQ Global Market and deregistered under the
Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.
