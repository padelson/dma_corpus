2   

     
   

  



  

2.3 _Certain Definitions_.

  



  

2.3.1 _Working Capital_. " _Working Capital_ " of the Acquired Companies is
defined on, and shall be calculated in accordance with, _Schedule 2.3.1_. Any

included on _Schedule 2.3.1_ shall be included in the calculation of Working
Capital consistent with the calculation set forth on _Schedule 2.3.1_.

  



  

2.3.2 _Closing Working Capital_. " _Closing Working Capital_ " means the
Working Capital of the Acquired Companies determined on a consolidated basis
as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date, as reflected on the Final Adjustment
Statement.

  



  

2.3.3 _Working Capital Target_. " _Working Capital Target_ " means Forty
Four Million Sixty Two Thousand Dollars ($44,062,000).

  



  

2.4 _Estimated Purchase Price; Payment of Indebtedness of Acquired
Companies_.

  



  

2.4.1 _Estimated Purchase Price_. No later than four (4) Business Days
before the Closing, Sellers Representative, on behalf of all Sellers, shall
deliver to Buyer its good faith calculation of Audited June 30 EBITDA and the
Base Purchase Price, which shall be used in calculating the Closing Purchase
Price, and a good faith estimate of each of the Closing Cash, the Closing
Indebtedness and the Closing Working Capital, in accordance with Section
2.5.1 based upon the most recent ascertainable financial information
available, and shall execute a certificate setting forth such amounts (the "
_Closing Certificate_ "). Not later than two (2) Business Days before the
Closing, Buyer shall notify Sellers Representative in writing whether
it objects to any of Sellers Representatives estimates of the Closing Cash,
the Closing Indebtedness or the Closing Working Capital. Any such objection
must be a reasonable, good-faith objection and must (a) include the reasons
for such objection with particularity and (b) involve a disputed amount that
represents at least ten percent (10%) of one or more of such estimates of
Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness or Closing Working Capital.  If Sellers
Representative does not agree with Buyers objection, or if Buyer and
Sellers Representative are otherwise unable to agree on one or more of the
estimates of the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness or the
Closing Working Capital by noon, Dallas, Texas, time, on the Business Day
before Closing, then, (a) in the event of a disagreement regarding the
estimate of the Closing Cash, " _Estimated Closing Cash_ " shall be equal to
the amount of Cash as of the end of the monthly period most recently
preceding the Closing Date for which the Companys internally prepared
financial statements are available, as determined from such financial
statements; (b) in the event of a disagreement regarding the estimate of the
Closing Indebtedness, " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ " shall be equal to
the sum of (1) the amounts set forth in the Pay-Off Documents, plus (2), with
respect to the components of the Closing Indebtedness not set forth in the
Pay-Off Documents, the amount of such Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies
as of the end of the monthly period most recently preceding the Closing Date
for which the Companys internally prepared financial statements are
available, as determined from such financial statements; and (c) in the event
of a disagreement regarding the estimate of the Closing Working Capital, "
_Estimated Closing Working Capital_ " shall be equal to the amount of Working
Capital of the Acquired Companies as of the end of the monthly period most
recently preceding the Closing Date for which the Companys internally
prepared financial statements are available, as determined from such
financial statements. In the event that Buyer does not object (or objects but
then later drops the objection) to Sellers Representatives estimates of the
Closing Cash, the Closing

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

Indebtedness or the Closing Working Capital, then such estimates set forth on
the Closing Certificate that are not the subject of an objection shall be the
" _Estimated Closing Cash_ ," " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ ," and "
_Estimated Closing Working Capital_ ," as applicable. In the event that Buyer
objects to one or more of Sellers Representatives estimates set forth in
the Closing Certificate and Buyer and Sellers Representative subsequently
agree upon an estimate that had been the subject of an objection, then such
agreed-upon estimate shall be the " _Estimated Closing Cash_ ," " _Estimated
Closing Indebtedness_ ," or " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ ," as
applicable.  As used herein, " _Estimated Purchase Price_ " means an amount
equal to the Closing Purchase Price calculated as set forth in Section 2.2,
assuming for purposes of such calculation that Audited June 30 EBITDA and the
Base Purchase Price are as calculated by Sellers Representative, the Closing
Cash is equal to the Estimated Closing Cash, that the Closing Indebtedness is
equal to the Estimated Closing Indebtedness and that the Closing Working
Capital is equal to the Estimated Closing Working Capital. Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer shall (a) pay
and deliver the Estimated Purchase Price (as calculated based upon the
Closing Certificate) less the Escrowed Funds (the " _Closing Date Payment_
") to Sellers by means of a wire transfer of immediately available cash funds
to an account or accounts as directed by Sellers Representative not later
than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing (the " _Sellers 
Account_"); (b) pay the Escrowed Funds to the Escrow Agent; and (c) pay the
Optionholders Payment to the Company.

  



  

2.4.2 _Payment of Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies_.  Buyer will pay,
or cause to be paid, in full at or immediately following the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, the Estimated Closing Indebtedness as of the
Closing Date of the Acquired Companies. In order to facilitate such repayment,
no later than three (3) Business Days before the Closing, Sellers
Representative shall cause the Acquired Companies to obtain payoff letters
for the repayment of such Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies, which
payoff letters will be in a commercially reasonable form reasonably
acceptable to Buyer and Buyers lenders and shall indicate that the Acquired
Companies lenders have agreed to release immediately all applicable Liens
relating to the assets and properties of the Acquired Companies, including
the redelivery of all stock certificates held pursuant to any such terminated
stock pledge agreements (collectively, the " _Pay-Off Documents_ ").

  



  

2.4.3 _Payment of Company Transaction Expenses_.  Buyer will pay, or cause
to be paid, in full at the Closing, the Company Transaction Expenses as set
forth on the Company Transaction Expense Statement in accordance with the
instructions provided in the Company Transaction Expense Statement. In order
to facilitate such payment, no later than three (3) Business Days before the
Closing, Sellers Representative shall provide Buyer with a true, complete
and correct list (the " _Company Transaction Expense Statement_ ") of the
amount of the unpaid fees, expenses and other similar amounts arising from
the provision of services prior to the Closing that have been or are expected
to be incurred on or prior to the Closing Date on behalf of the Acquired
Companies or any Seller in connection with this Agreement, the Non-Compete
Agreement and the Separation Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including without limitation any investment banking,
accounting, advisory, brokers, finders, escrow agent or legal fees or fees
paid to any Governmental Entity or third party (collectively, the "
_Company Transaction Expenses_ "), and the name of the persons to whom such
payments are to be made and wiring instructions for the recipients of such
payments.

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

2.4.4 _Withholding_. The Company shall deduct and withhold from the
consideration payable to the Optionholders pursuant to this Agreement
any amount as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that
amounts are so properly withheld by the Company, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Optionholders.

  



  

2.5 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

  



  

2.5.1 _Adjustment Statement Preparation_. Within sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Sellers
Representative, on behalf of Sellers, (a) a consolidated balance sheet of the
Acquired Companies as of 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date, prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the 2004 Audited
Financial Statements as modified by the Statement of Accounting Principles
attached hereto as _Schedule 2.5_ and in accordance with _Schedule 2.3.1_
(the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), (b) a statement based on such balance
sheet setting forth the amount of the Closing Cash, the Closing Indebtedness
and the Closing Working Capital of the Acquired Companies, on a consolidated
basis, respectively, as of the Closing (the " _Preliminary Adjustment
Statement_ "), (c) a statement setting forth Buyers calculations of Audited
June 30 EBITDA and the Base Purchase Price, and (d) based on the Closing
Cash, the Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Working Capital reflected on
the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and Buyers calculations of Audited June
30 EBITDA and the Base Purchase Price, Buyers written calculation of the
Closing Purchase Price, and the adjustment necessary to reconcile the
Estimated Purchase Price to the Closing Purchase Price (" _Preliminary Post-
Closing Adjustment_ "). In preparing the Closing Balance Sheets and the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement and in calculating the Audited June 30
EBITDA and the Base Purchase Price: (a) any and all effects on the assets or
liabilities of any of the Acquired Companies of any financing or refinancing
arrangements entered into by Buyer at any time at or after the Closing Date
or any other transactions entered into by any of Sellers, Sellers
Representative, Buyer, or the Acquired Companies in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be entirely
disregarded; (b) it shall be assumed that the Acquired Companies and their
respective lines of business shall be continued as a going concern; and (c)
there shall not be taken into account any of the plans, transactions
or changes that Buyer intends to initiate or make or cause to be initiated or
made at or after the Closing Date with respect to any of the Acquired
Companies or its respective business or assets, or any facts or circumstances
that are unique or particular to Buyer or any assets or liabilities of Buyer,
or any obligation for the payment of the Closing Purchase Price hereunder.

  



  

2.5.2 _Review by the Sellers  Representative_.  Sellers Representative
shall review the Closing Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Adjustment Statement,
Buyers calculations of Audited June 30 EBITDA and the Base Purchase Price
and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment and, if Sellers Representative
reasonably believes that any of them was not prepared in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, Sellers Representative shall so notify Buyer in
writing no later than thirty (30) days after Sellers Representatives
receipt thereof, setting forth in such notice Sellers Representatives
objection or objections to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, Buyers
calculations of Audited June 30 EBITDA and the Base Purchase Price or the
Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment with particularity and the specific
changes or adjustments

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

that Sellers Representative claims are required to be made thereto in order
to conform the same to the terms of this Agreement. Any notice of objection
delivered pursuant to this Section 2.5.2 shall specify in reasonable detail
the nature of any disagreement so asserted.

  



  

2.5.3 _Adjustment Statement Dispute Resolution_. If Sellers Representative
notifies Buyer of an objection to the Closing Balance Sheet, the Preliminary
Adjustment Statement, Buyers calculations of Audited June 30 EBITDA and the
Base Purchase Price or the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment pursuant to
Section 2.5.2, and if Buyer and Sellers Representative are unable to resolve
such dispute through good faith negotiations within thirty (30) days after
Sellers Representatives delivery of such written notice of objection, then,
the parties shall mutually engage and submit such dispute to, and the same
shall be finally resolved in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement
by, the New York office of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (the "
_Independent Accountants_ "). The Independent Accountants shall determine
and report in writing to Buyer and Sellers Representative as to the
resolution of all disputed matters submitted to the Independent Accountants
and the effect of such determinations on the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Preliminary Adjustment Statement, the calculations of Audited June 30 EBITDA
and the Base Purchase Price and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment
within thirty (30) days after such submission or such longer period as the
Independent Accountants may reasonably require, and such determinations shall
be final, binding and conclusive as to Buyer, Sellers, Sellers
Representative and their respective Affiliates. Buyer and Sellers shall each
make readily available to the Independent Accountants all relevant work
papers and books and records relating to the Acquired Companies, the Closing
Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, the calculations of
Audited June 30 EBITDA and the Base Purchase Price and the Preliminary Post-
Closing Adjustment as are requested by the Independent Accountants and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Independent
Accountants in resolving any disputed matters. The fees and expenses of
the Independent Accountants shall be allocated between Sellers and Buyer so
that Sellers share of such fees and expenses shall be equal to the product
of (i) and (ii), where (i) is the aggregate amount of such fees and expenses
and where (ii) is a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount in dispute
that is ultimately unsuccessfully disputed by Sellers (as determined by the
Independent Accountants) and the denominator of which is the total amount of
such disputed items so submitted.

  



  

2.5.4 _Final Adjustment Statement and Post-Closing Adjustment_. The Closing
Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, the calculations of
Audited June 30 EBITDA, the Base Purchase Price and the Preliminary Post-
Closing Adjustment shall become the " _Final Closing Balance Sheet_ ," the "
_Final Adjustment Statement_ ," the final calculations of Audited June 30
EBITDA and the Base Purchase Price (the " _Final Calculations_ ") and the "
_Final Post-Closing Adjustment_ ," respectively, and as such shall become
final, binding and conclusive upon Buyer, Sellers, Sellers Representative
and their respective Affiliates for all purposes of this Agreement, upon the
earliest to occur of the following:

  



  

(a) the mutual acceptance by Buyer and Sellers Representative of the Closing
Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, the Buyers calculations
of Audited June 30 EBITDA and the Base Purchase Price and the
Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment, respectively, with such changes or
adjustments thereto, if any, as may be proposed by Sellers Representative
and consented to by Buyer;

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

(b) the expiration of thirty (30) days after Sellers Representatives
receipt of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Adjustment Statement,
the Buyers calculations of Audited June 30 EBITDA and the Base Purchase
Price and the Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment, respectively, without
timely written objection thereto by Sellers Representative in accordance
with Section 2.5.2; or

  



  

(c) the delivery to Buyer and Sellers Representative by the Independent
Accountants of the report of their determination of all disputed matters
submitted to them pursuant to Section 2.5.3 together with revisions of the
Closing Balance Sheet, the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, the Buyers
calculations of Audited June 30 EBITDA and the Base Purchase Price and the
Preliminary Post-Closing Adjustment.

  



  

2.5.5 _Adjustment of Closing Purchase Price_. If the Closing Purchase Price
minus the Estimated Purchase Price is a positive number, then (a) Buyer and
Sellers Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the
Escrowed Funds to Sellers Representative and (b) Buyer shall pay the amount
of the Final Post-Closing Adjustment to Sellers Representative. If the
Closing Purchase Price minus the Estimated Purchase Price is a negative
number, then (a) if the Escrowed Funds exceed the amount of the Final Post-
Closing Adjustment, then Buyer and Sellers Representative shall jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent (i) to pay such excess to Sellers Representative
and (ii) to pay the remainder of the Escrowed Funds to Buyer, and (b) if the
amount of the Final Post-Closing Adjustment exceeds the Escrowed Funds, then
Buyer and Sellers Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
pay the Escrowed Funds to Buyer, and Sellers, in accordance with the
allocations set forth on _Schedule 2.6_, shall be jointly and severally

basis.

taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the

Representative, any extensions thereof) for the respective taxable periods,
and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Tax
Authority, and (ii) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior
to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if
the other party so requests, Sellers and Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause
the Acquired Companies to, allow the other party to take possession of such
books and records. Buyer and Sellers further agree, upon request, to use
their reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document
from any Tax Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

amount or economic benefit of any refunds of Taxes of the Acquired Companies
for any Straddle Period shall be apportioned between Sellers and Buyer in the
manner described in Section 10.6. Any such amounts owing to Sellers or

for Sellers, unless Buyer or the Acquired Companies deliver notices under the
WARN Act in such a manner and at such time that Sellers bear no liability
with respect thereto.

  



  

8.2.8 _Surrender and Cancellation of Stock Options_.  Prior to or
concurrently with the Closing, the Company shall cause all of the Stock
Options to be surrendered to the Company and cancelled.

  



  

8.2.9 _Termination of Stockholders Agreement_. With respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each Seller hereby waives the
applicability of, and the rights such Seller had, has or may have under or
pursuant to, the Stockholders Agreement, including any preemptive right or
right of first offer. Each Seller that is a party to the Stockholders
Agreement hereby covenants and agrees with the other Sellers, the Company and
Buyer that, effective immediately upon the Closing, the Stockholders
Agreement shall terminate and be deemed cancelled in its entirety, and each
Seller unconditionally and forever releases and discharges each other party
to the Stockholders Agreement from all obligations and liabilities arising
thereunder.  From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees that the Company and
its successors and assigns unconditionally release and forever discharge each
party to the Stockholders Agreement from all obligations and liabilities
arising thereunder. The foregoing termination of the Stockholders Agreement
and Buyers covenant in this Section 8.2.9 shall be of no force or effect
unless and until the Closing shall have occurred, and the Stockholders
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms
unless and until such time as the Closing has occurred.

  



  

8.2.10 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) Each Person who is as of the Closing Date an employee of the Acquired
Companies shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Acquired

  



  

36   

     
   

  



  

Companies before the Closing Date for purposes of eligibility and vesting
under the employee benefit plans of Buyer or its Affiliates, if any, in which
such employee participates after the Closing (such plans, collectively, the "
_New Plans_ ") and for purposes of any applicable vacation, paid time off
or severance policy, except to the extent such credit would result in
a duplication of benefits or was not recognized under the applicable Benefit
Plan of the Acquired Company (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ").
In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision
benefits to any such employee, Buyer shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived
for such employee and his or her covered dependents except to the extent any
such person has not satisfied any corresponding exclusions or requirements
under the applicable Old Plan. Buyer shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.  Nothing
contained herein shall entitle any Person who is, as of the Closing Date, an
employee of the Acquired Companies to participate in the New Plans.

  



  

(b) Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to comply with the terms and
conditions of any written employment agreements between any Acquired Company
and management in effect as of the Closing Date, including, but not limited
to, any applicable severance obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
with respect to the departure of the chief executive officer of the Company,
at the Closing the Company shall pay to the chief executive officer all
payments provided for in the Separation Agreement.

  



  

8.2.11 _Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the earlier of the Closing or termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof, no Seller shall take or permit any other
Person on its behalf to take, and the Acquired Companies shall not, and shall
cause their shareholders, Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, advisors, agents and representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (a) solicit or initiate, or encourage the submission of, any
proposal or indication of interest relating to an Alternative Transaction (as
defined below), (b) participate in any discussion or negotiation with any
third party regarding, or furnish to any person or entity any information
with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Alternative Transaction or (c) authorize, approve, consummate,
engage in, or enter into any agreement with respect to, any Alternative
Transaction. For purposes of this Agreement, "Alternative Transaction" means
(i) reorganization, dissolution, liquidation, or recapitalization of or
involving any of the Acquired Companies, (ii) merger, consolidation or
acquisition of or involving any of the Acquired Companies, (iii) sale of any
material amount of assets of any of the Acquired Companies, (iv) direct or
indirect purchase, sale or other disposition of any capital stock or other
equity interests of any of the Acquired Companies (other than among existing
stockholders), (v) similar transaction or business combination involving any
of the Acquired Companies or their respective businesses or capital stock or
assets or (vi) other transaction the consummation of which would prevent,
impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

37   

     
   

  



  

8.2.12 _Consents_. After the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing,
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, but excluding
making any payments, to obtain the third party consents specified in
_Schedule 6.1(j)_.

  



  

8.2.13 _Letters of Credit_. Concurrently with the Closing, Buyer shall
provide back-up letters of credit to replace the letters of credit set forth
on _Schedule 8.2.13_.

  



  

8.2.14 _Restrictive Covenant_. Each Seller (other than Ron Ross, who is a
party to that certain Non-Competition and Confidentiality Agreement between
Ron Ross and Buyer, and the Institutional Holders) agrees that, from and
after the date hereof and continuing through December 31, 2007, such Seller
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly
solicit, recruit, or otherwise seek to employ any employee of the Acquired
Companies or Buyer or any of their subsidiaries who is acting in
such capacity as of the date hereof or has acted in such capacity at any time
within the twelve-month period immediately preceding the date of solicitation
or recruitment; _provided_ that this provision shall not prohibit or
restrict Sellers or their Affiliates from soliciting, recruiting or otherwise
seeking to employ any employee whose employment is terminated "without Cause"
or "for Good Reason" (as defined under an applicable employment agreement);
and _provided_   _further_ , that general advertising activities not
specifically directed to any employees shall not be a violation of this
provision. Sellers agree that any violation of this Section 8.2.14 would
cause irreparable harm to Buyer and its Affiliates. If any Sellers violate any
provision of this Section 8.2.14, Buyer shall be entitled, in addition to any
other remedies that it may have, to specific, injunctive or other equitable
relief (without the requirement of posting of a bond or other security) in
order to enforce such provision.

  



  

8.3 _Acknowledgements_. Buyer does not make, and has not made,
any representations or warranties relating to Buyer or otherwise other than
those expressly set forth herein and Sellers do not make, and have not made,
any representations or warranties relating to Sellers, the Acquired Companies
or the businesses of the Acquired Companies or otherwise, in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby other than those expressly set forth

prediction, any data, any financial information or any memoranda or offering
materials or presentations, including any memoranda and materials provided by

any such information, memoranda or materials are included in the Disclosure
Schedule or referred to in the representations and warranties set forth
herein. Except as provided herein, no Person has been authorized by Sellers
to make any representation or warranty relating to Sellers, the Acquired
Companies or the businesses of the Acquired Companies or otherwise in

representation or warranty may not be relied upon as having been authorized
by Sellers and shall not be deemed to have been made by Sellers.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 9**

  



  

 **Termination**

  



  

9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated:

  



  

38   

     
   

  



  

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and Sellers Representative at any
time prior to the Closing;

  



  

(b) by Buyer or Sellers Representative, by notice to the other party, (i) in
the event of a breach by any of the Company, Sellers or Sellers
Representative (if Buyer seeks to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(b)) or Buyer (if Sellers Representative seeks to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(b)) of any representation, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or (ii) if any fact, circumstance,
result, change, event or violation shall have occurred, which in the case of
either clause (i) or (ii) (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in Section 6.1(c) or 6.2(c), as applicable, and (B) cannot be or
has not been cured within ten (10) Business Days following receipt by the
non-terminating party of written notice of such breach, fact, circumstance,
result, change, event or violation;

  



  

(c) by (i) Buyer, by notice to Sellers Representative, if the satisfaction
of any of the conditions in Section 6.1 by September 30, 2005 is or
becomes impossible (other than through the failure of Buyer to comply with
its obligations under this Agreement and except as provided in Section
9.1(d) below) and Buyer has not waived such condition; or (ii)
Sellers Representative, by notice to Buyer, if the satisfaction of any of
the conditions in Section 6.2 by September 30, 2005 is or becomes
impossible (other than through the failure of Sellers or Sellers
Representative to comply with their obligations under this Agreement) and
Sellers Representative has not waived such condition; or

  



  

(d) by Buyer or Sellers Representative, by notice to the other party, if the
Closing has not occurred (other than, if Buyer seeks to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d), through the failure of Buyer to
comply fully with its obligations under this Agreement or, if Sellers
Representative seeks to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.1(d), through the failure of any of Sellers or Sellers Representative to
comply fully with its obligations under this Agreement) on or before
September 30, 2005; provided however, that if Beacon has delivered a Beacon
Registration Statement and the Closing shall not have occurred because Beacon
has not received the PWC Consent, Buyer shall not be entitled to terminate
this Agreement as a result of the failure of such condition to be satisfied
prior to November 15, 2005.

  



  

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 9.1(a), then all provisions of this Agreement except Section 8.2.1
shall thereupon become void without any liability on the part of any party
hereto to any other party hereto. If this Agreement is terminated other
than pursuant to Section 9.1(a), such termination will not affect any right
or remedy which accrued hereunder or under applicable Laws prior to or on
account of such termination, and the provisions of this Agreement shall
survive such termination to the extent required so that each party may
enforce all rights and remedies available to such party hereunder or under
applicable Laws in respect of such termination and so that any party
responsible for any breach or nonperformance of its obligations hereunder
prior to termination shall remain liable for the consequences thereof.

 **ARTICLE 10**

  



  

 **Indemnification**

  



  

10.1 _Indemnification of Buyer_. From and after the Closing and subject to
Sections 10.2, 10.4 and 10.5, each Seller shall, severally and not jointly,
indemnify Buyer, the Acquired Companies, and each officer, director,
employee, agent, partner, successor and assign of Buyer and the Acquired
Companies (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ "), against and hold the
Buyer Indemnitees harmless from any Losses based upon, arising out of or
caused by any inaccuracy in, or breach of, the representations and warranties
made by such Seller in Article 3 or any breach by such Seller of its covenant
in Section 2.1 to deliver its Securities to Buyer at the Closing (the "
_Separate Covenant_ "). From and after the Closing and subject to Sections
10.2, 10.4 and 10.5, Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify the Buyer
Indemnitees from (a) any Losses based upon, arising out of or caused by any
inaccuracy in, or breach of, the representations and warranties in Article 4,
(b) any Losses based upon, arising out of or caused by any breach or
nonperformance of any covenant or obligation made or incurred by Sellers
herein (other than Tax Breaches, which are addressed in Section 10.6, and the
Separate Covenant), (c) to the extent that any such Claim is not covered by
the directors and officers insurance policy required pursuant to Section
8.2.4(b), any Claim for indemnification against any of the Acquired Companies
by reason of the fact that any Seller or any of their directors, officers,
employees or agents, was a director, officer, employee or agent of one or
more of the Acquired Companies or was serving at the request of any
such entity as a partner, trustee, director, officer, employee, or agent of
one or more of the Acquired Companies (other than any Claims for which the
Losses that are the subject thereof result from actions or omissions that
constitute a breach of any other representation, warranty or covenant of any
Seller hereunder), including with respect to any Claim brought by Buyer
against any Seller (whether such Claim is pursuant to this Agreement,
applicable law or otherwise), (d) any Losses based upon, arising out of or
caused by the sale or distribution or alleged sale or distribution by the
Acquired Companies of products containing asbestos (the indemnity set forth
in this Section 10.1(d) is referred to herein as the " _Special Indemnity_
"), (e) any amounts required to pay any Company Transaction Expenses not set
forth on the Company Transaction Expense Statement and paid upon Closing or
any obligations of the Acquired Companies based upon, arising out of or
pursuant to the Separation Agreement or Ron Ross employment by, or
termination of employment with, the Acquired Companies (but excluding any
Claims based upon or arising out of the Non-Compete Agreement) (the "
_Expense Indemnity_ ") or (f) Sellers Representatives proportionate share
of Claims for indemnity brought by the Escrow Agent against Buyer and/or
Sellers Representative pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (to the extent any
such amounts are not paid by Sellers Representative or by Sellers directly).

  



  

10.2 _Limitations on Indemnification of Buyer_.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the indemnification of Buyer Indemnitees
provided for in this Agreement shall be subject to the limitations and
conditions set forth in this Section 10.2 as follows:

  



  

(a) Any Claim by a Buyer Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to Section
10.1 based upon, arising out of or caused by any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation or warranty in Article 3, Section 4.2.1, Section 4.2.2,
Section 4.18 or a breach of the Separate Covenant or pursuant to the Expense
Indemnity may be made at any time. Any

  



  

40   

     
   

  



  

Claim by a Buyer Indemnitee for indemnification pursuant to this Article 10
based upon, arising out of or caused by any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty in Section 4.6 by a Tax Breach or with respect to
Section 10.1(c) for Claims brought by Ronald R. Ross or any of the
Institutional Holders shall be required to be made by delivering notice to
Sellers Representative no later than the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations. Any claim by a Buyer Indemnitee for indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.1 based upon, arising out of or caused by any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty in Section 4.8,
Section 4.9 or Section 4.29 or pursuant to Section 10.1(c) (other than with
respect to Claims by Ronald R. Ross or any of the Institutional Holders as
provided above) or the Special Indemnity shall be required to be made by
delivering notice to the Sellers Representative no later than the second
anniversary of the Closing Date. Any Claim by a Buyer Indemnitee
for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1 based upon, arising out of
or caused by any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
in Article 4 (other than Section 4.2.1, Section 4.2.2, Section 4.6, Section
4.8, Section 4.9, Section 4.18 or Section 4.29) or any breach or
nonperformance of any covenant or obligation made or incurred by Seller
herein (other than the Separate Covenant) shall be required to be made by
delivering notice to the Sellers Representative no later than the first
anniversary of the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) The Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to seek payment from Sellers
(subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the
limitations in Section 10.1) directly for all amounts due to the Buyer
Indemnitees for Losses under this Article 10 (i) in the case of Losses
resulting from a breach of a Sellers representations and warranties in
Article 3 or from a breach of the Separate Covenant, up to an amount, with
respect to such Seller, equal to the Purchase Price received by such Seller
and (ii) in the case of Losses resulting from a breach of any representation
or warranty in Article 4, or any breach or nonperformance of any covenant or
obligation made or incurred by Sellers herein (other than the Separate
Covenant and the obligations in Section 2.5.5), or pursuant to Sections
10.1(c) and 10.1(f), or the Special Indemnity or the Expense Indemnity, up to
an amount, with respect to each Seller, equal to such Sellers pro rata share
of such Losses (based upon the allocation percentages set forth on _Schedule
2.6_ ), but in any event not to exceed an amount equal to the Purchase Price
received by such Seller; provided, however, that the foregoing limitations
shall not apply to the Separate Covenant or to the Sellers covenant set
forth in Section 2.5.5 to be jointly and severally liable to pay amounts in
excess of the Escrowed Funds due to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.5.5.

  



  

(c) Sellers shall not be required to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees
hereunder with respect to Claims for any Losses under this Article 10 except
to the extent that the aggregate amount of Losses for which the Buyer
Indemnitees are otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Article 10 exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the " _Deductible
Amount_ ") (it being understood and agreed that the Deductible Amount is
intended as a deductible, and Sellers shall not be liable for any Losses
included in the Deductible Amount for which the Buyer Indemnitees are
otherwise entitled to indemnification). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Article 10, the Deductible Amount shall not apply to the
Expense Indemnity, or any Losses relating to or arising out of or in
connection with any Claims for Losses based upon, arising out of or caused by
any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty in Article 3,
Section 4.2.1. Section 4.2.2, Section 4.6, Section 4.18 or Section 4.29,
Sellers obligations under Article 2, including a breach of the Separate
Covenant, Tax Breaches

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

or Claims pursuant to Section 10.1(f) (and any Losses arising in connection
with any such Claims shall not apply against the Deductible Amount).

  



  

(d) The aggregate liability of Sellers pursuant to this Article 10 with
respect to all Claims for indemnification (other than Claims for Losses based
upon, arising out of or caused by any breach of any representation or
warranty in Article 3, Section 4.2.1, Section 4.2.2, Section 4.6, Section
4.18, Section 4.29, the Expense Indemnity, the Sellers obligations
under Article 2, including a breach of the Separate Covenant, Tax Breaches or
Claims pursuant to Section 10.1(f)) shall not exceed an amount equal to Six
Million Dollars ($6,000,000).

  



  

(e) Any Claims for indemnification under this Article 10 shall be net of any
Tax benefit actually realized (by reason of a Tax deduction or credit,
basis increase, shifting of income, or otherwise) by any Buyer Indemnitee
in connection with the Losses that form the basis of the Buyer Indemnitees
Claim for indemnification hereunder.

  



  

(f) Any Claims for indemnification under this Article 10 shall be net of any
insurance proceeds or other amounts received by the Buyer Indemnitees from
third parties with respect to the event giving rise to such indemnification
obligation.

  



  

(g) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under this
Article 10 if, and to the extent that, Buyer shall have received the benefit
of an adjustment pursuant to Article 2 hereof due to the fact that the item
that is the subject of the indemnification Claim was specifically taken into
account in the final determination of Closing Working Capital.

  



  

10.3 _Indemnification of Sellers_. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall indemnify Sellers and their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, Affiliates, agents, partners, successors and assigns
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ "), against and hold the Seller
Indemnitees harmless from any Losses based upon, arising out of or caused by
(a) the breach of any of the representations and warranties made by Buyer in
Article 5; and (b) the breach or nonperformance of any covenant or obligation
made or incurred by Buyer herein. Any Claims for indemnification under this
Article 10 shall be net of any insurance proceeds or other amounts received
by the Seller Indemnitees from third parties with respect to the event giving
rise to such indemnification obligation.

  



  

10.4 _Third Party Claims_. This Section 10.4 shall not apply to Tax
Proceedings, which are covered by the provisions of Section 10.6. In order
for a party (the " _indemnitee_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of, or involving
a Claim made by any Person against the indemnitee (a " _Third Party Claim_
"), such indemnitee must notify the party from whom indemnification hereunder
is sought (the " _indemnitor_ ") in writing of the Third-Party Claim no later
than thirty (30) days after such Claim is first asserted. Such notice
(to the extent known) shall state in reasonable detail the amount or
estimated amount of such Claim, and shall identify the specific basis (or
bases) for such Claim, including the representations, warranties or covenants
in this Agreement alleged to have been breached. Failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except
to the extent the indemnitor shall have been actually prejudiced as a result
of such failure.  Thereafter, the indemnitee shall deliver to the indemnitor,
without undue delay, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers received by the indemnitee) relating

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

to the Third-Party Claim so long as any such disclosure could not reasonably
be expected to have an adverse effect on the attorney-client or any other
privilege that may be available to the indemnitee in connection therewith.
 If a Third-Party Claim is made against an indemnitee, the indemnitor shall
be entitled to assume and control the defense thereof with counsel selected
by the indemnitor. If the indemnitor assumes such defense, the indemnitee
shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
indemnitor, it being understood that the indemnitor shall control such
defense.  If the indemnitor shall not assume the defense of any Third Party
Claim or litigation resulting therefrom, the indemnitee may defend against
such Claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate and may settle such
Claim or litigation on such terms as it may deem appropriate, with any such
settlement being subject to the prior written consent of the indemnitor
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), if prior to
such settlement, the indemnitor has acknowledged, without qualification
(other than by reference to the limitations hereunder), its indemnification
obligations hereunder with respect to such Third-Party Claim or portion
thereof (for which indemnification is sought) by written notice to the
indemnitee.. In the event the indemnitee is, directly or indirectly,
conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the indemnitor
shall cooperate with the indemnitee in such defense and make available to the
indemnitee, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the
indemnitors possession or under the indemnitors control relating thereto as
is reasonably required by the indemnitee. If the indemnitor so assumes the
defense of any Third-Party Claim, all of the indemnitees shall reasonably
cooperate with the indemnitor in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such
cooperation shall include, at the expense of the indemnitor, the retention
and (upon the indemnitors request) the provision to the indemnitor of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party
Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. If the indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim,
the indemnitor shall not, without the written consent of the indemnitee,
enter into any settlement, compromise or discharge or consent to the entry of
any judgment which imposes any equitable remedies or material obligations or
restrictions upon the indemnitee and which does not include an unconditional
written release from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim.

  



  

10.5 _Limitation of Remedies_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that,
should the Closing occur, the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all Claims relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (other than Claims relating to Section 8.1.5 or Section 8.2.14, Claims
of, or causes of action arising from, fraud or intentional misrepresentation,
or Claims arising from the Non-Compete Agreement or the Side Letter) shall be
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article 10. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer and each Seller hereby waives on behalf
of itself and all other Persons who might claim by, through or under him,
from and after the Closing, any and all rights and Claims (other than Claims
relating to Section 8.1.5 or Section 8.2.14 or Claims arising from fraud
or intentional misrepresentation) that he or any such other Person may have
other than a Claim for indemnification pursuant to the provisions set forth
in this Article 10.

  



  

43   

     
   

  



  

10.6 _Tax Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, the Sellers shall indemnify, save and hold
harmless the Buyer Indemnitees from and against (collectively, " _Seller
Taxes_ ") (i) all liability for Taxes of the Acquired Companies for all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods, (ii) any and all damages arising out of, resulting from
or incident to any breach by the Sellers of any covenant contained in Section
8.2.6, (iii) any increase in Tax liability for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Post-Closing Tax Period imposed on the Acquired Companies due to the
application of Code Section 280G to any payments made on or before the
Closing Date by an Acquired Company, and (iv) all liability (as a result of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502 6(a) or a comparable state or local Tax
provision) for Taxes of any Person which is or has been an Affiliate of the
Acquired Companies during a Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Sellers shall not be liable for or pay and shall not indemnify,
defend, save or hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees for any such Taxes
(collectively, " _Excluded Taxes_ ") imposed on the Acquired Companies as a
result of the transactions occurring on or prior to the Closing Date that are
properly allocable (based on, among other relevant factors, factors set forth
in Treasury Regulation 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) to periods after the Closing
Date. For the avoidance of doubt, all items paid by the Company on the
Closing Date shall be deemed to have been paid by the Company during the
final Pre-Closing Tax Period.

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, save and hold harmless
the Sellers from and against (i) all liability for Taxes of the Acquired
Companies for any Post-Closing Tax Period and (ii) any and all damages
arising out of, resulting from or incident to the breach by Buyer of any
covenant contained in Section 8.2.6.

  



  

(c) In the case of any Straddle Period:

  



  

(i) real, personal and intangible property Taxes and any other Taxes levied
on a per diem basis (" _Per Diem Taxes_ ") of the Acquired Companies for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Per Diem Taxes
for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the total number of days
in the Straddle Period; and

  



  

(ii) the Taxes of the Acquired Companies (other than Per Diem Taxes) for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be computed as if such Tax Period ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date.

  



  

(d) Sellers indemnity obligations in respect of Seller Taxes, as determined
pursuant to Section 10.6(a), shall initially be effected by Sellers payment
to Buyer of the excess of (i) any such Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (as
may be evidenced by any Tax Return prepared by Buyer in accordance with
Section 8.2.6 or as otherwise indicated in a written notice prepared by Buyer
that is satisfactory to the Seller Representative) over (ii) the sum of (A)
the amount of such Taxes with respect to the Acquired Companies paid by
Sellers at any time, and (B) the amount of such Taxes paid by the Acquired
Companies on or prior to the Closing Date. Sellers shall pay such excess to
Buyer within twenty (20) days after written demand thereof is made by Buyer
(but not earlier than five (5) days before the date on which the Taxes for
the relevant Tax Period are required to be paid to the relevant Taxing
Authority). If the sum of (i) the amount of any Seller Taxes paid by Sellers
at any time, and (ii) the amount of

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

Seller Taxes paid by the Acquired Companies on or prior to the Closing Date
exceeds the actual amount of Seller Taxes, Buyer shall pay to Sellers the
amount of such excess within twenty (20) days after the Tax Return with
respect to the final liability for such Taxes is required to be filed with
the relevant Taxing Authority. In the case of a Tax that is contested in
accordance with the provisions of Section 10.6(e), payment of the Tax to the
appropriate Taxing Authority shall not be considered to be due earlier than
the date a final determination to such effect is made by the appropriate
Taxing Authority or court.

  



  

(e) If a Claim shall be made by any Taxing Authority, which, if successful,

12.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and
the schedules and exhibits hereto constitute the exclusive statement of the
agreement among Buyer and each Seller concerning the subject matter hereof,
and supersedes all other prior agreements, oral or written, among or between
any of the parties hereto concerning such subject matter. All negotiations

agreements, oral or written, in relation to the subject matter hereof among
or between any of the parties hereto other than those expressly set forth or
expressly incorporated herein.

  



  

12.3 _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by Buyer and Sellers Representative and, prior
to the Closing, the Company. In addition, any failure of a Person to comply
with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition contained herein may be
waived only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or

strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
other failure.

  



  

12.4 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW
THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND COVENANTS

56   

     
   

  



  

ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO, BASED ON, OR IN
CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY
THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER
SOUNDING IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN
ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS SECTION 12.4 WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY.

  



  

12.5 _Binding Effect_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of Buyer, each Seller, and the respective successors and
permitted assigns of Buyer and of each Seller.

  



  

12.6 _Headings_. The article and section headings used in this Agreement are
intended solely for convenience of reference, do not themselves form a part
of this Agreement, and may not be given effect in the interpretation or
construction of this Agreement.

Available_. Whenever the context requires in this Agreement, the masculine
gender includes the feminine or neuter, the neuter gender includes the
masculine or feminine, the singular number includes the plural, and the
plural number includes the singular. In every place where it is used in
this Agreement, the word "including" is intended and shall be construed to
mean "including, without limitation." In every place where this Agreement
states that documents or information have been provided, delivered or made
available to Buyer, the inclusion of such documents or information on the
Companys "z" drive (to which Buyer was granted access) shall be deemed to
constitute such documents or information having been provided, delivered
or made available to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

12.8 _Counterparts, Facsimile and Electronic Signatures_. This Agreement may
be executed and delivered in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, and all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument. A facsimile or other copy of a signature,
including execution and delivery of the Agreement by electronic exchange
bearing the copies of a partys signature, shall be deemed an original for
purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

12.9 _Third Parties_.  Except as may otherwise be expressly stated herein, no
provision of this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to confer on
any Person, other than the parties hereto, any rights hereunder.  Buyer
Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees who are not otherwise parties to this
Agreement shall be third party beneficiaries of this Agreement.

  



  

12.10 _Schedules and Exhibits_. The schedules and exhibits (including the
Disclosure Schedule) referenced in this Agreement constitute an integral part
of this Agreement as if fully rewritten herein. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement or in any of the Schedules, any
information disclosed in one Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed in such
other Schedules and applicable to such other representations and warranties
to the extent that the disclosure is clearly applicable on the face of such
item to such other Schedule and such other representations and warranties.
 Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule shall not be deemed to
constitute an admission that such item or fact is material for the
purposes of this

  



  

57   

     
   

  



  

Agreement. All references in this document to "this Agreement" and the terms
"herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and the like shall be deemed to include all
of such schedules and exhibits.

  



  

12.11 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the
choice-of-laws or conflicts-of-laws provisions thereof.

  



  

12.12 _No Assignments_. No assignment of all or any part of this Agreement or
any right or obligation hereunder may be made by any party hereto without the
prior written consent of all other parties hereto, and any attempted
assignment without such consent shall be void and of no force or effect;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (a) Buyer may assign any of its rights or
delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any controlled Affiliate
of Buyer provided, further, that no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of
its obligations hereunder; and (b) Buyer may assign its rights, but not its
obligations, under this Agreement to any of its financing sources.

  



  

12.13 _Sellers  Representative_. By execution and delivery of this
Agreement, each Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints Brazos
Private Equity Partners, LLC as the true and lawful agent and attorney-in-
fact of such Seller with full authority and power of substitution to act in
the name, place and stead of such Seller, its successors and assigns as
Sellers Representative with respect to all matters relating to that
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Sellers Representative is
hereby authorized by each Seller to execute any and all instruments or other
documents on behalf of such Seller, and to do any and all other acts or
things on behalf of such Seller, which Sellers Representative may deem
necessary or advisable, or which may be required pursuant to this Agreement
or otherwise, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and the performance of all obligations hereunder before,
at and following the Closing. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Sellers Representative shall have the full and exclusive
authority to (a) agree with Buyer with respect to any matter or thing
required or deemed necessary by Sellers Representative in connection with
the provisions of this Agreement calling for the agreement of Sellers, give
and receive notices on behalf of all Sellers, and act on behalf of Sellers in
connection with any matter as to which Sellers are or may be obligated under
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, all in the absolute discretion of
Sellers Representative, (b) in general, do all things and perform all
acts, including without limitation executing and delivering all agreements,
certificates, receipts, consents, elections, instructions, and other
instruments or documents contemplated by, or deemed by Sellers
Representative to be necessary or advisable in connection with, this
Agreement, and (c) take all actions necessary or desirable in connection with
the defense or settlement of any indemnification Claims pursuant to Article
10 and performance of obligations under Article 2, including to withhold
funds for satisfaction of expenses or other liabilities or obligations or to
withhold funds for potential indemnification Claims made hereunder.  Sellers
shall cooperate with Sellers Representative and any accountants, attorneys
or other agents whom it may retain to assist in carrying out its duties
hereunder. All decisions by Sellers Representative shall be binding upon all
Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or
otherwise contest the same. Sellers Representative may communicate with any
Seller or any other Person concerning his responsibilities hereunder, but it
is not required to do so. Sellers Representative has a duty to serve in
good faith the interests of Sellers and to perform its designated role under
this Agreement, but Sellers Representative shall have no financial liability
whatsoever to any Person

  



  

58   

     
   

  



  

relating to its service hereunder (including any action taken or omitted to
be taken), except that it shall be liable for harm which it directly causes
by an act of willful misconduct.  Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless
Sellers Representative against any loss, expense (including reasonable
attorneys fees) or other liability arising out of its service as Sellers
Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, other than for
harm directly caused by an act of willful misconduct.
Sellers Representative may resign at any time by notifying Buyer and Sellers
in writing. Buyer shall be entitled conclusively and absolutely to rely,
without inquiry, upon any action of Sellers Representative as the action of
each Seller in all matters referred to in this Section 12.13.

 **SCHEDULE I**

  



  

 **EARN-OUT PAYMENT**

  



  

This _Schedule I_ sets forth the terms of calculation and payment of the
Earn-Out Payment, which the parties intend to be based on the performance of
the Acquired Companies as if operated throughout the Measurement Period (as
defined below) on a stand-alone basis.

  



  

1. _Contingent Earn-Out Payment_.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this _Schedule I_, Buyer shall make a cash payment to Sellers by means of a wire transfer of immediately available funds to Sellers Account, such payment to be made following the conclusion of the twelve-month period ending on December 31, 2005 (the " _Earn-Out Calculation Date_ ", such twelve-month period being referred to herein as the " _Measurement Period_ ", and such payment being referred to herein as the " _Earn-Out Payment_ ") in accordance with Section 6 hereof. The amount of the Earn-Out Payment shall be:

  



  

(a) If (i) the Base Purchase Price is equal to $152.5 million, or (ii) if the
Base Purchase Price is less than $152.5 million and the Adjusted EBITDA
Amount (as defined below) is greater than or equal to the Low EBITDA Target
(calculated pursuant to _Annex A_ to this _Schedule I)_, an amount equal
to:

  



  

(A) $10.0 million if the Adjusted EBITDA Amount is greater than or equal to
the High EBITDA Target (calculated pursuant to _Annex _A to this _Schedule
I)_, and zero if the Adjusted EBITDA Amount is less than the Low EBITDA
Target; _provided_ that, the Earn-Out Payment payable under this clause (A)
shall be ratably reduced to the extent that the Adjusted EBITDA Amount is
less than the High EBITDA Target but greater than or equal to the Low EBITDA
Target (by way of example, if the High EBITDA Target is $22 million, the Low
EBITDA Target is $18 million and the Adjusted EBITDA Amount is $20.0 million,
then the Earn-Out Payment payable under this clause (A) shall be reduced by
50% and shall be $5.0 million; and if the Adjusted EBITDA Amount is $17.8
million, then no Earn-Out Payment is due under this clause (A)), plus

  



  

(B) if the Base Purchase Price is less than $152.5 million and the Adjusted
EBITDA Amount is greater than or equal to the Low EBITDA Target, an amount
equal to the difference of (x) $152.5 million minus (y) the Base Purchase
Price.

  



  

(b) If the Base Purchase Price is less than $152.5 million and the Adjusted
EBITDA Amount is less than the Low EBITDA Target, an amount (if a positive
number) equal to the difference of (i) the product of (A) the Adjusted EBITDA
Amount multiplied by (B) $152.5 million divided by Low EBITDA Target, minus
(ii) the Base Purchase Price.

  



  

(c) The amount of the Earn-Out Payment shall be reduced by any amounts earned
under the Acquired Companies 2005 Executive Earnout Bonus Plan based upon
the Adjusted EBITDA Amount and such amounts shall be paid to the applicable
executives by the Acquired Companies.

  



  

1   

     
   

  



  

2. _Adjusted EBITDA Amount Calculation and Covenants_. " _Adjusted EBITDA Amount_ " means, with respect to the Measurement Period, the consolidated earnings of the Acquired Companies before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization determined in accordance with GAAP consistently applied with the 2004 Audited Financial Statements and in accordance with the Statement of Accounting Principles attached as _Schedule 2.5_ to the Agreement; provided, however, that in the event that PWC, in preparing the June 30 Audit, shall require any material modification by the Acquired Companies with respect to their reserves or allowances for bad debt or inventory, then the reserves and/or allowances for bad debt and/or inventory for the Adjusted EBITDA Amount shall be computed in accordance with GAAP, on a basis consistent with the June 30 Audit.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Adjusted EBITDA Amount shall not reflect any of the following:

  



  

(a) incremental expenses caused by Buyer to be implemented or incurred post-
Closing, including, without limitation:

  



  

(i) increased expenses associated with benefit plans, including as a result
of implementation of Buyers benefit plans;

  



  

(ii) increased insurance costs;

  



  

(iii) relocation costs;

  



  

(iv) charges related to the closure of any of the Acquired Companies
facilities; and

  



  

(v) third party consulting fees, it being understood that the continuation of
any third party consulting fees currently incurred by the Acquired Companies
shall not be deemed an incremental expense incurred by Buyer;

  



  

(b) expense reductions caused by Buyer to be implemented or incurred post-
Closing ( _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall receive the benefit of
any expense reductions that relate to or result from business programs or
plans implemented by the Acquired Companies prior to the Closing) with
respect to:

  



  

(i) benefit plans, including as a result of implementation of Buyers benefit
plans; and

  



  

(ii) insurance costs.

  



  

(c) intercompany expenses, other than expenses incurred on an arms length
basis that replace existing expense items in the Budget attached as _Annex
B_ to this Schedule I (the "Budget"), provided that any such expense shall
not exceed the amount included in the Budget (e.g., if Buyer uses Buyers in-
house staff to perform functions previously out-sourced and allocates the
costs for such staff to the Acquired Companies, then, for purposes of
calculating the Adjusted EBITDA Amount, the amount of the allocation together
with any amounts actually incurred shall not exceed the budgeted amount);

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

(d) costs and expenses incurred by the Acquired Companies, Buyer, Seller and
their respective affiliates related to the transactions contemplated by the
Agreement, including, without limitation, costs and expenses associated with
the June 30 Audit and the physical inventory conducted in connection
therewith and the cost of the additional directors and officers insurance
purchased pursuant to Section 8.2.4 of the Agreement;

  



  

(e) non-compete payments, severance costs and expenses expensed for
terminated individuals during the Measurement Period;

  



  

(f) management fees paid to Brazos Private Equity Partners, LLC or its
affiliates from January 1, 2005 through the Closing Date and outside director
fees paid from January 1, 2005 through the Closing Date;

  



  

(g) stock and equity compensation expenses;

  



  

(h) extraordinary gains or losses (as determined under GAAP);

  



  

(i) one-time non-recurring items that are unrelated to the ongoing business
of the Acquired Companies;

  



  

(j) gains or losses associated with the sale of assets (other than sales of
inventory in the ordinary course of business);

  



  

(k) effects of adjustments required by purchase accounting;

  



  

(l) any differences between the use of straight-line rent expense rather than
actual rent expense related to leases for the Louisville Branch 4001 and
Lavergne Branch 4009; or

  



  

(m) costs associated with discontinued operations.

  



  

In addition, following the Closing: Buyer and the Acquired Companies shall
maintain separate books and records of the Acquired Companies throughout the
Measurement Period; any changes in accounting principles, policies and
practices (including relating to allowances for doubtful accounts, vendor
rebates and slow moving and obsolete inventory) from those utilized in the
preparation of the 2004 Audited Financial Statements and in accordance
with the Statement of Accounting Principles attached as _Schedule 2.5_
to the Agreement with respect to the Acquired Companies after Closing shall
not be permitted to reduce the Adjusted EBITDA Amount; provided, however,
that in the event that PWC, in preparing the June 30 Audit, shall require any
material modification by the Acquired Companies with respect to their
reserves or allowances for bad debt or inventory, then the reserves and/or
allowances for bad debt and/or inventory for the Adjusted EBITDA Amount shall
be computed in accordance with GAAP, on a basis consistent with the June 30
Audit; all bonus and compensation of the employees of the Acquired Companies
shall be determined on a basis consistent with the bonus and compensation
plans and programs of the Acquired Companies in effect on the Closing Date;
Buyer and the Acquired Companies shall not divert any customer sales
opportunities belonging to the Acquired Companies to Buyer or any Affiliate
thereof so that such opportunities are not reflected in the Adjusted EBITDA
Amount; no products of the Acquired Companies will be sold to Buyer or any of
its Affiliates at rates less favorable to the Acquired Companies than would
be the case with

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

unrelated Persons in arms length transactions; no products or services will
be purchased by the Acquired Companies at rates less favorable to the
Acquired Companies than would be the case with unrelated Persons in arms
length transactions; if Buyer and the Acquired Companies shall close or
consolidate any facility during the Measurement Period, then the Adjusted
EBITDA Amount shall be calculated without regard to such facilitys operating
results for the remainder of the Measurement Period, and the High EBITDA
Target and the Low EBITDA Target shall be reduced by an amount equal to such
facilitys budgeted operating results set forth in the Budget for the
remainder of the Measurement Period; if the employment agreement of any of
John Bradberry, Dan Tinker or Tim Hanks is terminated "without Cause" (as
defined in such agreements) or if any of John Bradberry, Dan Tinker or Tim
Hanks terminates his employment agreement for "Good Reason" (as defined, and
in accordance with the procedures set forth in, such agreements), then the
Adjusted EBITDA Amount shall be calculated without regard to such terminated
employees regions operating results for the remainder of the Measurement
Period and the High EBITDA Target and the Low EBITDA Target shall be reduced
by an amount equal to such regions budgeted operating results set forth in
the Budget for the remainder of the Measurement Period; and Buyer and its
Affiliates shall take no action outside the ordinary course of business of
the Acquired Companies that is intended to impede payment of the Earn
Out Payment.

  



  

3. _Monthly Financials and Earn-Out Statement_.  Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Sellers Representative within thirty (30) days of the end of each month during the Measurement Period monthly financial statements for the Acquired Companies prepared in a form consistent with the Acquired Companies practices prior to Closing. Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Sellers Representative within sixty (60) days following the Earn-Out Calculation Date a statement (the " _Earn-Out Statement_ ") presenting: (a) all of the components of the calculation used to determine the Adjusted EBITDA Amount, (b) a calculation indicating whether or not an Earn-Out Payment is due and (c) if applicable, the amount of such Earn-Out Payment.

  



  

4. _Sellers  Right of Examination_.  Sellers Representative shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the Earn-Out Statement in which it may examine the calculation, its components and such underlying records and workpapers as are reasonably necessary and appropriate. Buyer shall cooperate fully and promptly with Sellers Representative in such examination and Buyer shall promptly make available to Sellers Representative any reasonably relevant records under Buyers reasonable control requested by Sellers Representative in connection with such examination by the Sellers Representative. On or before the conclusion of such thirty (30) day period, Sellers Representative shall either accept the Earn-Out Statement as final or provide Buyer with all proposed adjustments to the Earn-Out Statement, presenting the various components thereof and the calculation thereof (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ").

  



  

5. _Good Faith Negotiation; Dispute Resolution_. If the Notice of Disagreement is timely delivered, the parties shall, for a period of fifteen (15) days thereafter, negotiate reasonably and in good faith to resolve in writing the matters in dispute giving rise to the Notice of Disagreement. If, after such fifteen (15) day period, the parties are unable to resolve such matters, then either of the parties may submit the dispute to the Independent Accountants (with such accounting firm to be selected in accordance with the Agreement). Notwithstanding anything in this _Schedule I_ to the contrary, if a Notice of Disagreement has been timely delivered 

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

with respect to any payment to be made under this Agreement, and the dispute
has not been resolved within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the
Notice of Disagreement, the amount not in dispute shall be paid not later
than twenty (20) days following the delivery of the Notice of Disagreement.
 The Independent Accountants shall determine and report in writing to Buyer
and Sellers Representative as to the resolution of all disputed
matters submitted to the Independent Accountants and the effect of such
determinations on the Earn-Out Payment within fifteen (15) days after such
submission or such longer period as the Independent Accountants may
reasonably require but in no event later than forty-five (45) days after such
submission, and such determinations shall be final, binding and conclusive as
to Buyer, Sellers, Sellers Representative and their respective Affiliates.
 Buyer and Sellers Representative shall each make readily available to the
Independent Accountants all relevant work papers and books and
records relating to the Acquired Companies as are requested by the
Independent Accountants and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with the Independent Accountants in resolving any disputed matters.
The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accountants shall be allocated
between the Sellers and the Buyer so that the Sellers share of such fees and
expenses shall be equal to the product of (i) and (ii), where (i) is the
aggregate amount of such fees and expenses and where (ii) is a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount in dispute that is ultimately unsuccessfully
disputed by the Sellers (as determined by the Independent Accountants) and
the denominator of which is the total amount of such disputed items so
submitted.

  



  

6. _Date of Payment_. If Sellers Representative accepts the Earn-Out Statement or if Sellers Representative does not provide the Notice of Disagreement within the required thirty (30) day period, the Earn-Out Payment shall become final and any obligation to make a payment under this Agreement resulting from the calculation set forth therein shall be due and payable by wire transfer in immediately available funds within five (5) days of the end of such thirty (30) day period. If Sellers Representative provides a Notice of Disagreement within the required thirty (30) day period, then the Earn-Out Payment shall become final and any obligation to make a payment under this Agreement resulting from the calculation set forth therein shall be due and payable by wire transfer in immediately available funds within five (5) days after the mutual acceptance of the Earn-Out Statement by Buyer and Sellers Representative with such changes or adjustments thereto, if any, as may be proposed by Sellers Representative and consented to by Buyer or the delivery to Buyer and Sellers Representative by the Independent Accountants of the report and their determination of all disputed matters submitted to them regarding the Earn-Out Statement. The date when payment is due pursuant to the terms of this paragraph 6 is referred to herein as the " _Due Date_."

  



  

7. _Interest_. In the event an Earn-Out Payment is not paid by the Due Date, such Earn-Out Payment shall accrue interest from the Due Date until such Earn-Out Payment is made at an interest rate equal to eight percent (8%) per annum for the period from the Due Date to the date of the payment calculated on the basis of a 365 day year and the actual number of days elapsed.

  



  

8. _Events of Default_. If any of the Acquired Companies shall at any time (a) between the Closing Date and the Earn-Out Calculation Date: (i) merge or consolidate with or into another person (other than a merger where the Acquired Companies are the only constituent parties), (ii) dissolve, terminate, liquidate or sell all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any other person, (iii) have an order for relief entered involuntarily against it under applicable bankruptcy laws, (iv) make an assignment for the general benefit of its creditors, (v) apply for, seek, consent 

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

to, or acquiesce in, the appointment of a receiver, custodian, trustee,
conservator, liquidator or similar official for it or any substantial part of
its property, or (v) file a petition seeking relief under applicable
bankruptcy laws or (b) between the Closing Date and November 15, 2005, take
any action to implement a technology systems integration or conversion with
respect to the Acquired Companies and Buyer or its Affiliates; provided,
however, that Buyer or its Affiliates will be permitted to commence mapping
data files for financial reporting, such mapping to involve the Acquired
Companies corporate IT staff and limited personnel involved in inventory
control, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other personnel involved
in maintenance of master files, such actions not to distract the regional and
branch personnel from their day-to-day responsibilities (each of the items in
(a) and (b) above, an " _Event of Default_ "); provided, further, however,
that a breach of clause (b) above shall not be deemed to have occurred unless
written notice of the action claimed to constitute the breach shall be given
by Sellers Representative to Buyer and such action shall not cease within
three (3) Business Days following Buyers receipt of such written notice.
Within three (3) Business Days following the occurrence of an Event of
Default set forth in clause (a) above, and not later than January 6, 2006 if
an Event of Default set forth in clause (b) above shall occur, Buyer shall
pay to Sellers Account an amount in cash equal to (i) if the Base Purchase
Price is $152.5 million, $10.0 million, or (ii) if the Base Purchase Price is
less than $152.5 million, the sum of (A) $10.0 million plus (B) the
difference of (x) $152.5 million minus (y) the Base Purchase Price.

  



  

9. _Further Actions and Assurances_.  Buyer and Sellers shall execute and deliver any and all documents, and shall cause all other action to be taken which may be necessary or proper to effect or evidence the provisions of this _Schedule I_ and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 **ANNEX A**

  



  

 **CALCULATION OF LOW EBITDA TARGET AND HIGH EBITDA TARGET**

  



  

The Low EBITDA Target will be an amount equal to the sum of (a) $17.5 million

month during the period beginning on the day after the Closing Date through
the Earn-Out Calculation Date (the " _Post-Closing Measurement Period_ ").
The High EBITDA Target will be an amount equal to the sum of (b) $21.5
million plus (b) the sum of the Monthly Adjustment Amounts for each whole or
partial month during the Post-Closing Measurement Period. "

(September) plus $82,708 (October) plus $84,780 (November) plus $84,785
(December), and (b) the High EBITDA Target would be an amount equal to
$21,794,663, which is an amount equal to the sum of (i) $21.5 million plus
(ii) the sum of $42,390 (September) plus $82,708 (October) plus $84,780
