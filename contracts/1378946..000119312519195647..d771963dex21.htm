AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 15, 2019 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and between United Financial Bancorp, Inc., a Connecticut corporation
(the " _Company_ "), and Peoples United Financial, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Purchaser_ ").

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Purchaser and the Company have determined
that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and their
shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for herein, pursuant to which the Company will, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, merge with and into Purchaser (the " _Merger_
"), so that Purchaser is the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in the
Merger;

WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement is
intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
in accordance with the Connecticut Business Corporation Act (the " _CBCA_ ")
and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective
Time, the Company shall merge with and into Purchaser. Purchaser shall be the
Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. Upon consummation of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Company shall terminate.

 

1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New
York City time, at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, on a date
which shall be no later than three __ (3) business days after
the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur
of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof (other than those
conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), or such other date or time
mutually agreed in writing by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ ").

 

1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, on the Closing Date, the Company and Purchaser shall file or cause
to be filed (a) a certificate of merger containing such information as is
required by the relevant provisions of the CBCA in order to effect the Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Connecticut (the " _Connecticut
Certificate of Merger_ ") and (b) a certificate of merger containing such
information as is required by the relevant provisions of the DGCL in order to
effect the Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "
_Delaware Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective at such
time as is specified in the Connecticut Certificate of Merger and the Delaware
Certificate of Merger (such time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



-1- 

    

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the CBCA and
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

1.5 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Purchaser, the Company or
the holder of any of the following securities:

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_, each share of the common stock, no
par value, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for shares of
Company Common Stock owned by the Company or Purchaser (in each case other
than shares of Company Common Stock (i) held in Company Benefit Plans (other
than the Company ESOP) or trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and
the like or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, or (ii) shares
held, directly or indirectly, in respect of debts previously contracted,
collectively the " _Excluded Shares_ "), shall be converted into the right to
receive, without interest, 0.875 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of the
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser (the " _Purchaser
Common Stock_ "); _it_ _being_ _understood_ that upon the Effective Time,
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, the Purchaser Common Stock, including the
shares issued to former holders of Company Common Stock, shall be the common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ I_ shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each,
a " _Certificate_ "; _it_ _being_ _understood_ that any reference herein to "
_Certificate_ " shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account
statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock)
previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) the number of whole shares
of Purchaser Common Stock which such shares of Company Common Stock have been
converted into the right to receive pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_,
(ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted into the right to
receive pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_,
without any interest thereon, and (iii) any dividends or distributions which
the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.
Certificates previously representing shares of Company Common Stock shall be
exchanged for certificates or, at Purchasers option, evidence of shares
in book-entry form (collectively, the " _New Certificates_ ") representing
whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock (together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto and cash in lieu of fractional shares
issued in consideration therefor) upon the surrender of such Certificates in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, without any interest thereon. If, prior
to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock or
Company Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or
exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities in any such
case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in
capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend or distribution,
an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange
Ratio to give the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the
Company or Purchaser (in each case other than the Excluded Shares) shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no Purchaser Common Stock or any other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

1.6 _Purchaser Common Stock_. At and after the Effective Time, each share
of Purchaser Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

1.7 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

(a) _Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option, whether or not then vested or free of conditions to payment,
automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock equal to the quotient of (i) the product of (A) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option,
__multiplied__ __ by (B) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Stock
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of
such Company Stock Option, __divided__ __ by (ii) the Purchaser Share Closing
Price, with cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares. The Surviving
Corporation shall issue the consideration described in this _Section
1.7(a)_, net of applicable tax withholdings, which shall be accomplished
through the withholding of shares of Purchaser Common Stock with a value equal
to the applicable tax withholding obligation, within five (5) business days
following the Closing Date.

(b) _Company PSUs_. At the Effective Time, each Company PSU, whether or
not then vested or free of conditions to payment, automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, shall be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive a number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal
to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company PSU at the target level of performance applicable to such Company
PSU, as determined in accordance with the applicable award agreement pursuant
to which such Company PSU was granted __multiplied__ by (ii) the Exchange
Ratio, with cash payable in lieu of fractional shares. The Surviving
Corporation shall issue the consideration described in this  _Section
1.7(b)_, net of applicable tax withholdings, which shall be accomplished
through the withholding of shares of Purchaser Common Stock with a value equal
to the applicable tax withholding obligation, within five (5) business days
following the Closing Date.

(c) _Other Company Equity Awards_. At the Effective Time, each Other
Company Equity Award, whether or not then vested or free of conditions to
payment, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder

Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
a bank or trust company designated by Purchaser and reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") pursuant to an agreement entered into
by Purchaser prior to the Closing that is reasonably acceptable to the
Company, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article_ __ _ II_, (a) New Certificates to be issued
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ and exchanged pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.2(a)_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (b)
cash in lieu of any fractional shares (such cash and New
Certificates described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with

 



-4- 

    

 any dividends or distributions with respect thereto (after giving effect to
_Section_ __ _ 6.10_), being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_
"). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Purchaser; _provided_ , that no such investment or losses thereon
shall affect the merger consideration payable to the holders of Certificates.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid
to Purchaser.

 

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event
later than five (5) days thereafter, Purchaser shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates representing
shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that
have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive Purchaser
Common Stock pursuant to _Article_ __ _ I_, a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Exchange Agent and shall be customary in form and substance and subject to
the Companys approval, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the number of whole
shares of Purchaser Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or
Certificates shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to
this Agreement as well as any dividends or distributions to be paid pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate or
Certificates for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder
of such Certificate or Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, as applicable, (i) a New Certificate representing that number of
whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock to which such holder of Company Common
Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of _Article_ __ _
I_ and (ii) a check representing the amount of (A) any cash in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
Certificate or Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article_ __ _ II_ and (B) any dividends or distributions which the holder
thereof has the right to receive pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_, and
the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares
payable to holders of Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon surrender, the
number of whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock which the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted into the
right to receive pursuant to this Agreement and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated
by this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.

 

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to the
Purchaser Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with this _Article_ __ _ II_. After the surrender of a Certificate
in accordance with this  _Article_ __ _ II_, the record holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any
interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the
whole shares of the Purchaser Common Stock which the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificate have been converted into the right to
receive (after giving effect to _Section_ __ _ 6.10_).

 

(c) If any certificate representing shares of the Purchaser Common Stock is
to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate or
Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate or Certificates so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that
the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance
any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of
a certificate representing shares of the Purchaser Common Stock in any name
other than that of the

 



-5- 

    

 registered holder of the Certificate or Certificates surrendered, or
required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for (i)
New Certificates representing shares of Purchaser Common Stock and (ii) any
cash in lieu of fractional shares or in respect of dividends or distributions
as provided in this  _Article_ __ _ II_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of the Purchaser Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to the Purchaser Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Purchaser. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Purchaser shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company who
otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash
(rounded to the nearest cent) determined by __multiplying__ (i) the average of
the closing sale prices of Purchaser Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select
Market (" _Nasdaq_ ") as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for the five
(5) full trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the
Closing Date (the " _Purchaser Share Closing Price_ ") by (ii) the fraction
of a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form)
of the Purchaser Common Stock which such holder (taking into account all
fractional share interests to be received by such holder) would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.5_.

 

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be paid to Purchaser. Any former shareholders of the Company who have
not theretofore complied with this _Article_ __ _ II_ shall thereafter look
only to Purchaser for payment of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock, cash
in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on
the Purchaser Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of
Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.

 

(g) Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the
Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any consideration, including cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock, cash dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ or any other
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company
Common Stock or Company Equity Awards, as applicable, such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock or Company Equity
Awards, as applicable, in respect of which the deduction and withholding was
made by Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

 

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Purchaser, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Purchaser may determine is
reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed

 



-6- 

    

 Certificate the shares of Purchaser Common Stock, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and dividends or distributions deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

Except (a) as disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Purchaser concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ");
_provided_ , that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception
to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere
inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Company
that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance
or that such item is reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section
of _Article_ __ _ III_ shall be deemed to qualify (1) any other section of
_Article_ __ _ III_ specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (2) other
sections of _Article_ __ _ III_ to the extent it is reasonably apparent on
its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference) from a
reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections
or (b) as disclosed in any Company Reports filed by the Company prior to the
date hereof (but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the
heading "Risk Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-
looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-
specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Connecticut and is a bank
holding company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956
(the " _BHC Act_ "), which has elected to be, and qualifies as, a financial
holding company under the BHC Act. The Company has the corporate power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted in all material respects and is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties
and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to the Company or Purchaser,
as the case may be, any event, circumstance, development, change or effect
that, individually or in the aggregate, has a material adverse effect on (i)
the business, properties, assets, liabilities, results of operations or
financial condition of such person and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole (
_provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material
Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes in
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or applicable
regulatory accounting requirements or interpretations thereof, (B) changes,
after the date hereof, in laws, rules, regulations or agency requirements of
general applicability to companies in the industries in which such person and
its Subsidiaries operate, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental
Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional
political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or
in economic or market (including equity, credit and debt markets, as well as
changes in interest rates) conditions, (D) public disclosure of the execution
of this Agreement, public disclosure or consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including any effect on such persons or its
Subsidiaries relationships with its customers, employees or other persons) or
action expressly required by this Agreement or actions or omissions that
are taken with the prior written consent of or at the written direction of
Purchaser, in the case of the Company, or the Company, in the case of
Purchaser, (E) a decline in the trading price of such persons common stock or
the failure, in and of itself, to meet internal or other estimates,
predictions, projections or forecasts of revenue, net income or any other

 



-7- 

    

 measure of financial performance or budget, business or strategic plan for
any period ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that the underlying cause of such
decline or failure may be taken into account in determining whether a
Material Adverse Effect on such person has occurred to the extent not
otherwise excluded by this proviso), or (F) the expenses incurred by such
person and its Subsidiaries in negotiating, documenting, effecting and
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; except, with
respect to subclauses (A), (B), or (C), to the extent that the effects of such
change are disproportionately adverse to the business, properties,
assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of such
person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other companies
in the industries in which such person and its Subsidiaries operate); or (ii)
prevents or materially impairs, or would be reasonably likely to prevent or
materially impair, the ability of such person to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word "
_Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any person, means any other person
Controlled by such person, whether directly or indirectly, or any other person
who owns securities or other ownership interests having a majority of the
economic interest or voting power of such person. As used in this Agreement,
the word " _Control_ " and the correlative terms "Controlling" and
"Controlled," mean, with respect to any specified person, the power to direct
the management and policies of such person, directly or indirectly, whether
through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. True and
complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended
(the " _Company Charter_ "), and the Bylaws of the Company, as amended and
restated (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, have previously been made available by the Company to Purchaser.

 

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company (a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do business and, where such concept is
recognized under applicable law, in good standing in all jurisdictions
(whether federal, state, local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of
property or the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and in
which the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company and (iii) has all requisite corporate (or similar) power and authority
to own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted in all material respects. There are no restrictions on the ability
of any Subsidiary of the Company to pay dividends or distributions except for
restrictions on dividends or distributions under applicable law and, in the
case of a Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends
or distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. The
deposit accounts of the Company Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") to the fullest extent permitted by law,
all premiums and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have
been paid when due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance
are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. _Section_ __ _
3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete
list of all Subsidiaries of the Company as of the date hereof.

 3.2 _Capitalization_.

 settlement of outstanding Other Company Equity Awards that are not Company
Restricted Stock Awards, (vi) no shares of Company Preferred Stock are issued
and outstanding and (vii) no other shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of the Company are issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding.
All of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been
duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free
of preemptive rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness that have the right to vote on any matters on which shareholders
of the Company may vote. No Company Benefit Plan that is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, other than the Company ESOP,
owns or holds Company Common Stock. As of the date of this Agreement no trust
preferred or subordinated debt securities of the Company are issued or
outstanding. Other than Company Stock Options, Company PSUs and Other Company
Equity Awards, (i) there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants,
puts, calls, rights, exchangeable or convertible securities or other
commitments or agreements obligating the Company to issue, transfer, sell,
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, any such securities and (ii) there are
no contingent value rights, "phantom" stock or similar securities or rights
that are derivative of, or provide economic benefits based, directly or
indirectly, on the value of or price of, Company Common Stock or other equity
interests of the Company. There are no voting trusts, shareholder agreements,
proxies or other agreements in effect pursuant to which the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries has a contractual obligation with respect to the
voting or transfer of Company Common Stock or other equity interests of the
Company. All grants of Company Equity Awards were validly issued and
properly approved by the Board of Directors of the Company (or a committee
thereof) in accordance with the applicable Company Stock Plan and applicable
law, in each case in all material respects. All Company Stock Options have
been granted having a per share exercise price at least equal to the fair
market value of the underlying Company Common Stock on the date such Company
Stock Option was granted, and have not otherwise been modified within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code and associated Treasury Department
guidance.

(b) The Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests
of each of the Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of any liens, pledges,
charges, encumbrances and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all
of such shares or equity ownership interests are duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. No
Company Subsidiary has or is bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling
for the purchase or issuance of any shares of capital stock or any other
equity security of such Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to
purchase or otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity
security of such Subsidiary.

3.3 _Authority; No Violation_.

(a) The Company has full corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Merger have been duly and validly approved by the Board of Directors of
the Company. The Board of Directors of the Company has determined that the
Merger, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, is in the
best interests of the Company and its shareholders and has directed that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby be submitted to the
Companys shareholders for approval at a meeting of such shareholders and has
adopted a resolution to the foregoing effect. The execution and delivery of
the Bank Merger Agreement and the consummation of the Bank Merger have been
duly and validly approved by the board of directors of the Company Bank and
the Company as its sole shareholder. Except for the approval of this Agreement
and the Merger contemplated hereby by the affirmative vote of the holders
of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the outstanding Company Common Stock entitled
to vote (the " _Requisite Company Vote_ "), no other corporate proceedings on
the part of the Company are necessary to approve this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Company and (assuming due
authorization, execution and 

 



-9- 

    

 delivery by Purchaser) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (except
in all cases as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, preferential transfer, moratorium, rehabilitation,
liquidation, reorganization or similar laws affecting insured depository
institutions or their parent companies or the rights of creditors generally
and the availability of equitable remedies (the " _Enforceability Exceptions_
")).

 

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof, will (i)

trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which they or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound, except (in the case of
clause (ii) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults,
terminations, cancellations, accelerations or creations which, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

Company Report, as of the date thereof (and, in the case of registration
statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates
of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information

matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) required by
GAAP to be included on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company, except
for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company included in its Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2019 (including any notes

of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The
Company (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "
_Exchange Act_ ")) to ensure that material information relating to the
Company, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of the Company by others within those
entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange Act
and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Companys
outside auditors and the audit committee of the Companys Board of
Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the

adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information, and (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to believe that

chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next

material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-
offs and accruals) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney
representing the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed

otherwise. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, within

-22- 

    

 business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted
by it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or

with, the books and records of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash

the notes thereto. The books and records of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
have been, since January 1, 2017, and are being, maintained in all material
respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and
accounting requirements. KPMG has not resigned (or informed Purchaser that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
Purchaser as a result of or in connection with any disagreements
with Purchaser on a matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, either individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser, neither
Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability (whether absolute,
accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due) required by
GAAP to be included on a consolidated balance sheet of Purchaser, except for
those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated
balance sheet of Purchaser included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2019 (including any notes thereto), and
for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice since March 31, 2019, or in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-
direct control that, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser.
Purchaser (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to Purchaser, including its Subsidiaries, is made known
to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of Purchaser
by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (y)
has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof,
to Purchasers outside auditors and the audit committee of Purchasers Board
of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Purchasers ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (ii) to the knowledge of Purchaser, any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Purchasers internal controls over financial reporting.
To the knowledge of Purchaser, there is no reason to believe that Purchasers
outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

 

(d) Since January 1, 2017, (i) neither Purchaser nor any of its

 of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of
any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-
downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective internal accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices,
and (ii) no attorney representing Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not employed by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported

Returns in all jurisdictions in which Tax Returns are required to be filed by
it, and all such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material
respects. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries is the beneficiary of

Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return (other than a group the common parent
of which was Purchaser) or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any person
(other than Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as
a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither Purchaser nor
any of its Subsidiaries has been, within the past two (2) years or otherwise

licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses and ownership of their respective
properties, rights and assets under and pursuant to each (and have paid all
fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith), except where
neither the cost of failure to hold nor the cost of obtaining and holding
such license, franchise, permit or authorization (nor the failure to pay any
fees or assessments) would, either individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser, and, to
the knowledge of Purchaser, no suspension or cancellation of any such
necessary license, franchise, permit or authorization is threatened. Since
January 1, 2017, Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all

Requisite Regulatory Approvals), and to comply with the terms and conditions
of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third
parties and Governmental Entities. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, as soon as practicable and in no event later than thirty (30)
calendar days after the date of this Agreement, Purchaser and the Company
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, each prepare and file
any applications, notices, petitions and filings required to be filed with any
Governmental Entity in order to obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals.

(c) Purchaser and the Company shall have the right to review in advance,
and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the
information relating to the Company or Purchaser, as the case may be, and any
of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with
each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities necessary
or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party hereto shall
consult with the other in

 



-33- 

    

 advance of any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its
counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences.

 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of
Purchaser and the Company shall use its respective reasonable best efforts to
(i) avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned,
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing,
and (ii) avoid or eliminate each and every impediment, including with respect
to obtaining the Requisite Regulatory Approvals, so as to enable the Closing
to occur as soon as possible. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require Purchaser or
permit the Company to take, or agree to take, any action or agree to any
condition or restriction, in connection with the grant of a Requisite
Regulatory Approval, that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to the Merger (measured on a scale relative to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) (a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition_ ").

(e) Purchaser and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with
all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Purchaser,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Purchaser and the Company agrees, as
to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4
will, at the time the S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any,
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date
of mailing to Companys shareholders and at the time of the Companys Meeting
to consider and vote upon approval of the Merger, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which such statement was made, not misleading. Each of
Purchaser and the Company further agrees that if it becomes aware that any
information furnished by it would cause any of the statements in the S-4 or
the Proxy Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto to be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to
promptly inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to
correct the S-4 or the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement
thereto.

(f) Purchaser and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or
that the receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.

 

(g) As used in this Agreement, the " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ "
shall mean all regulatory authorizations, consents, orders or approvals, or
waiver thereof (i) from the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the State of
Connecticut Department of Banking and (ii) any other approvals set forth in 
_Sections_ __ _ 3.4_ and _4.4_ that are necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Bank
Merger, except for any such authorizations, consents, orders or approvals
the failure of which to be obtained would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser.

6.2 _Access to Information_. 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, counsel, accountants and advisors of Purchaser, reasonable access,
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to
all its properties, books, personnel and records, and shall cooperate with
Purchaser in preparing to execute after the Effective Time conversion or
consolidation of systems and business operations generally, and, during such
period, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make
available to Purchaser all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Purchaser may reasonably request. Upon reasonable
notice and subject to applicable laws, Purchaser shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and advisors of the Company, reasonable access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, and solely for
purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of Purchaser in
_Article IV_ , to the Purchasers properties, books, personnel and records.
Each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any
interference with the other partys regular business operations during any
such access. Neither Purchaser nor the Company nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights
of Purchasers or the Companys, as the case may be, customers, jeopardize
the attorney-client privilege or other legal privilege of the party in
possession or control of such information (after giving due consideration to
the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, fiduciary duty, duty of confidentiality or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate and request waivers or make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

(b) Each of Purchaser and the Company shall hold all information furnished
by or on behalf of the other party or any of such partys Subsidiaries or
representatives pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ in confidence to the
extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
confidentiality agreement, dated March 23, 2018, between Purchaser and the
Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the
representations and warranties of the other set forth herein.

 

6.3 _Shareholders_ __ _Approval_.

 

(a) The Company shall, in accordance with applicable law and the Company
Charter and Company Bylaws, call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of its shareholders (the " _Company Meeting_ ,") as soon as reasonably
practicable after the S-4 is declared effective, for the purpose of obtaining
the Requisite Company Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the type
customarily brought before an annual or special meeting of shareholders to
approve a merger. The Board of Directors of the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of the Company the
Requisite Company Vote, including by communicating to its shareholders its
recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Proxy Statement)
that they approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
by engaging a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to Purchaser to assist in
the solicitation of proxies from the holders of Company Common Stock relating
to the Requisite Company Vote. However, subject to _Sections_ __ _ 8.1_ and
_8.2_ , if the Board of Directors of the Company, after receiving the advice
of its outside counsel and, with respect to financial matters, its financial
advisor, determines in good faith that it would reasonably be expected to
violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue to recommend
this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to its shareholders, the
Board of Directors of the Company may submit this Agreement to its
shareholders without recommendation or may change its recommendation (although
the resolutions approving this

 



-35- 

    

 Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which
event the Board of Directors of the Company may communicate the basis for its
lack of a recommendation or a change in its recommendation to its
shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement
thereto to the extent required by law; _provided_ , that the Board of
Directors of the Company may not take any actions under this sentence unless
(i) it gives the Purchaser at least five (5) business days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action and a reasonable description of
the event or circumstances giving rise to its determination to take
such action (including, in the event such action is taken by the Board of
Directors of the Company in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the latest
material terms and conditions of, and the identity of the third party making,
any such Acquisition Proposal, or any amendment or modification thereof, or
describing in reasonable detail such other event or circumstances) and (ii) at
the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company takes
into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement proposed by the
Purchaser and after receiving the advice of its outside counsel and, with
respect to financial matters, its financial advisor, determines in good faith
that it would nevertheless reasonably be expected to violate its fiduciary
duties under applicable law to continue to recommend this Agreement. Any
material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ and will
require a new notice period as referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_,
except that the applicable period shall be three (3) business days.

 

(b) The Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting if, as of the
time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient
shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if
on the date of such meeting the Company has not received proxies representing
a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has
been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Company Meeting shall be
convened and the Merger shall be submitted to the shareholders of the Company
at the Company Meeting for the purpose of voting on the approval of the
Merger, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of
such obligation.

6.4 _Legal Conditions to Merger_. Subject in all respects to  _Sections
6.1_, _6.3_ and _6.11_ of this Agreement, each of Purchaser and the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable
best efforts (a) __ to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary,
proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal and regulatory
requirements that may be imposed on such party or its Subsidiaries with
respect to the Merger and the Bank Merger and, subject to the conditions set
forth in  _Article_ __ _ VII_ hereof, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the
other party to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval
of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party
that is required to be obtained by the Company or Purchaser or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

6.6 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date or, if shorter, during the
period of employment of a Continuing Employee following the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation shall provide each of the employees of the Company and
its Subsidiaries who continue to be employed by the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries immediately following the Effective Time (each a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") with (i) a base salary or wage rate, as applicable,
that is no less than the base salary or wage rate, as applicable, provided to
the Continuing Employee prior to Closing, (ii) target cash bonus opportunities
that are no

 



-36- 

    

 less favorable than the target cash bonus opportunities that are generally
made available to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries and (iii) employee benefits that, in the aggregate, are
substantially the same as those that are generally made available to similarly
situated employees of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries. Any employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who is terminated by the Company without cause,
at the Purchasers request on the Closing Date or by Purchaser without cause
within twelve (12) months following the Closing Date shall be entitled to
severance in accordance with Purchasers severance practice as set forth on 
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_ of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the requirements of this sentence shall not apply to any
employee who is covered by an employment agreement or the Company
Executive Change in Control Severance Plan.

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans of the
Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employees
become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time (the " _New
Plans_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such
employees and their eligible dependents under any New Plans, except to the
extent such pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply
under the analogous Company Benefit Plan, (ii) provide each such employee and
his or her eligible dependents with credit for any eligible expenses incurred
by such employee or dependent prior to the Effective Time under a Company
Benefit Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any
applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket requirements under any New
Plans, and (iii) recognize all service of such employees with the Company and
its Subsidiaries for all purposes in any New Plan to the same extent that such
service was taken into account under the analogous Company Benefit Plan prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the foregoing service recognition
shall not apply (A) to the extent it would result in duplication of benefits
for the same period of services, (B) for benefit accrual purposes under any
employee benefit plan of Purchaser or any of its affiliates that is a defined
benefit pension or post-retirement welfare plan or (C) where such service is
with respect to a newly established benefit plan of Purchaser for which
similarly situated employees of Purchaser do not receive past service credit.

(c) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.6(d)_ hereof, Purchaser shall, or shall
cause one of its Subsidiaries to, assume and honor all Company Benefit Plans
in accordance with their terms. Purchaser hereby acknowledges that a "change
in control" (or similar phrase) for purposes of the Company Benefit Plans set
forth on Schedule 3.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (to the extent
they include such a definition or phrase) will occur at the Effective Time.

 

(d) If Purchaser so requests (which request shall be made not less than
thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time), the Company shall take any and
all actions, to the extent permitted by law and the terms of the applicable
plan, required (including without limitation, the adoption of resolutions by
its Board of Directors) to amend, freeze and/or terminate any or all Company
Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time (as permitted by the
terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan), and, if requested by Purchaser,
to implement any such actions.

 

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing _Section_ __ _
6.6(d)_ hereof, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any and
all actions and adopt such necessary resolutions to terminate the Company
401(k) Plan (including the Company ESOP) effective as of the date immediately
preceding the Closing Date and adopt such amendments to the Company 401(k)
Plan to terminate the Company 401(k) Plan and effectuate the provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(e)_. In addition to the foregoing, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take any and all actions as may be
required, including amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan to permit each
participant in the Company 401(k) Plan who has a loan outstanding at the
Effective Time to make arrangements to continue to repay such loan in
accordance with the original amortization schedule until such time as the
participants 401(k) account balance is distributed. The form and substance of
all such resolutions and amendments shall be subject to the review and
approval of Purchaser, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the
Company

 



-37- 

    

 shall deliver to Purchaser an executed copy of the resolutions and amendment
as soon as practicable following their adoption by the Board of Directors of
the Company and shall fully comply with such resolutions and amendments. In
connection with the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan and the Merger, the
Company shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliate to, provide that (i)
all Company 401(k) Plan participant accounts shall be fully vested, (ii) all
benefit accruals under the Company 401(k) Plan will be frozen and no new
participants will be admitted to the Company 401(k) Plan on or after the
Company 401(k) Plan termination date, (iii) any contributions due to the
Company 401(k) Plan for the period before the Company 401(k) Plan termination
date and not yet paid on the Company 401(k) Plan termination date will be
contributed by the Company as soon as administratively feasible after the
Company 401(k) Plan termination date, (iv) all outstanding indebtedness of
the Company ESOP (including any ESOP Loan) be repaid by delivering a
sufficient number of unallocated shares of Company Common Stock to the Company
at least five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, and (v) all
remaining shares of Company Common Stock held by the Company ESOP trust after
repayment of the ESOP Loan be converted into shares of Purchaser Common Stock
in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 1.5_ hereof, and the balance of the
unallocated shares and any other unallocated assets remaining in the Company
ESOPs suspense account after repayment of the ESOP Loan and conversion of the
shares into Purchaser Common Stock be allocated as earnings to the accounts
of the Company ESOP participants who are employed as of the date of
termination of the Company 401(k) Plan based on their account balances under
the Company ESOP as of such date. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall provide Purchaser documentary evidence sufficient to show that all
outstanding indebtedness of the Company ESOP (including any ESOP Loan) has
been paid in full. As soon as practicable after the adoption of required
amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan in connection with the termination of
the Company 401(k) Plan, the Company shall file or cause to be filed (in
consultation with Purchaser) all necessary documents with the IRS for a
determination letter for termination of the Company 401(k) Plan. As soon as
practicable following the receipt of a favorable determination letter from the
IRS regarding the qualified status of the Company 401(k) Plan upon its
termination, the account balances in the Company 401(k) Plan (including the
Company ESOP account balance and the 401(k)/non-Company ESOP account balance
in the Company 401(k) Plan) shall either be distributed to participants and
beneficiaries or transferred to an eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or
individual retirement account as a participant or beneficiary may direct.
Prior to the distribution of account balances in the Company 401(k)
Plan, Purchaser shall take any and all actions as may be required, including
amendments to the tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan
designated by Purchaser (the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_ ") to permit each
Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code,
including of loans) at the time of such distribution from the Company 401(k)
Plan in the form of cash, notes (in the case of loans) or a combination
thereof, in an amount equal to the full account balance (i.e., the Company
ESOP account balance and the 401(k)/non-Company ESOP account balance in the
Company 401(k) Plan) distributed to such Continuing Employee from the Company
401(k) Plan to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the
Effective Time occurs before the payment of the Companys annual cash
incentive awards relating to calendar year 2019 (the " _2019 Incentives_ "),
(i) the Company shall be permitted to finally and conclusively determine, in
good faith and consistent with the terms and conditions of the applicable
Company Benefit Plans set forth on _Schedule 3.11(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (and, to the extent based on business results, based on
the most recent forecast or results available as of the Closing Date), the
amount of the 2019 Incentives earned by each employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who is employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each a " _Company Employee_ ") through
the Closing Date, which may, by mutual agreement of the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company (or his designee) and the Purchaser, be prorated, if
the Effective Time occurs in 2019, for the portion of the year elapsed between
January 1, 2019 and the Closing Date) or through December 31, 2019 if the
Closing Date is on or after December 31, 2019 (the " _Earned Portion_ ") and
(ii) the Surviving

 



-38- 

    

 Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to each Company Employee (who is
employed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) the Earned Portion of
such Company Employees 2019 Incentives on or as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date. If the Effective Time occurs in 2019, for the
balance of the 2019 calendar year following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall,
or shall cause its Affiliates to, determine the incentive opportunities for
Continuing Employees in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.6(a)_ hereof.

 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer,
director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving
Corporation, the Company, or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving
Corporation, the Company, Purchaser or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to
discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or
consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time
for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan,
New Plan or any other benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
particular Company Benefit Plan, New Plan or any other benefit or employment
plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without
limiting the generality of the final sentence of _Section_ __ _ 9.11_,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any person, including any current or former employee, officer, director
or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Company
Charter or Company Bylaws as in effect on the date of this Agreement or any
agreements providing for indemnification by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, each present and former director, officer or employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity)
(collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the
Effective Time, arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, the
fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another person and
pertaining to matters, acts or omissions existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including matters, acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the consideration and approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and Purchaser shall also advance
expenses as incurred by such Company Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
provided by applicable law, the Company Charter and Company Bylaws as
in effect on the date of this Agreement or any agreements providing for
indemnification by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company ( _provided_ , that
Purchaser may substitute therefor policies with a substantially comparable
insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to
claims against the present and former officers and directors of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries arising from facts or events which occurred at or
before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall not be obligated to
expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the current annual
premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the "
_Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time
exceed the Premium Cap, then 

 



-39- 

    

 Purchaser shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in
Purchasers good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available
at an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, the
Purchaser or (with the Purchasers permission, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, after taking into account the purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 6.7(b)_) the Company may obtain at or prior to the
Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under the Companys existing directors
and officers insurance policy providing equivalent coverage to that
described in the preceding sentence if and to the extent that the same may be
obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate, does not exceed the Premium
Cap. If the Purchaser or Company purchases such a "tail policy," Purchaser
shall maintain such "tail policy" in full force and effect from and after the
Effective Time and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

 

(c) The obligations of the Purchaser and the Company under this _Section_
__ _ 6.7_ shall not be terminated or modified after the Effective Time in a
manner so as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party or any other
person entitled to the benefit of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ without the prior
written consent of the affected Company Indemnified Party or affected person.
The rights of each Company Indemnified Party under this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_
shall be in addition to any rights such person may have under the CBCA, any
other applicable law or agreement.

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall survive the
Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives. If Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns will
consolidate with or merge into any other entity and not be the continuing or
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger, transfer all or
substantially all of its assets or deposits to any other entity or engage in
any similar transaction, then in each case, Purchaser will cause proper
provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser will
expressly assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_. For
the avoidance of doubt, to the extent required by any agreement previously
entered into by the Company in connection with a merger, acquisition or other
business combination, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall apply
to directors, officers, employees and fiduciaries of predecessor entities
previously acquired by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the
parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to
this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary
action as may be reasonably requested by the other party.

 

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Purchaser and the Company shall promptly
advise the other party of any fact, change, event or circumstance known to it
(i) that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) which it believes would
or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any
of its representations, warranties or covenants contained herein or that
reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate,
to the failure of a condition in Article VII; _provided_ , that any failure
to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach
shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ or
the failure of any condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or _Section_
__ _ 7.3_ to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement
by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the
underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ to be satisfied.

 

6.10 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Purchaser and
the Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends
in respect of Purchaser Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record
dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the

6.11 _Acquisition Proposals_. 

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their officers, directors, agents,
advisors and representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or
knowingly facilitate inquiries or proposals with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person
concerning any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) provide any confidential or
nonpublic information or data to, or have or participate in any discussions
with, any person relating to any Acquisition Proposal, except to (A) seek to
clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any inquiry or proposal
made by any person or (B) notify a person that has made or, to the knowledge
of the Company, is considering making, an Acquisition Proposal, of the
existence of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_; _provided_ ,
that, prior to the approval of the Merger by the shareholders of the Company
by the Requisite Company Vote, in the event the Company receives an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal, it may, and may permit
its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives to, furnish
or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate in
such negotiations or discussions to the extent that the Board of Directors of
the Company concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel, and with respect to financial matters, its financial advisor) that
failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to violate its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ , _further_ , that, prior to
providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to the
foregoing proviso, the Company shall have entered into a confidentiality
agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to it than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall not provide
such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with the Company. The
Company will, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than Purchaser with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. The Company will promptly (and in any event within one business day)
advise Purchaser following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry
which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the
substance thereof (including the material terms and conditions of and the
identity of the person making such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal, and
copies of any proposed agreements, financing commitments, term sheets or
letters of intent related thereto), and will keep Purchaser reasonably
apprised on a current basis of any related developments, discussions
and negotiations, including any amendments to or revisions of the material
terms of such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. As used in this Agreement, "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third
party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or
indirect, of 25% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or 25% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of
the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company,
(ii) any tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that,
if consummated, would result in such third party beneficially owning 25% or
more of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 25%
or more of the consolidated assets of the Company, or (iii) a merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in
the aggregate, constitute 25% or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company.

 

(b) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its
Board of Directors from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or from making any legally required disclosure to the
Companys shareholders; _provided_ , that such Rules will in no way eliminate
or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise
have under this Agreement.

 



-41- 

    

6.12 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company and Purchaser shall each
use their reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan, to
ensure that all press releases and other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with such joint
communications plan, and except in respect of any announcement required by
applicable law or regulation, a request by a Governmental Entity or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities
exchange, to consult with each other and provide each other the opportunity to
review and comment before issuing, any press release or, to the extent
practical, otherwise making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties hereto agree
that any initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be in mutually agreed form.

 

6.13 _Takeover Statutes_. None of the Company, Purchaser or their
respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any
Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary
steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable
Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may
become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby, each party and the members of their respective Boards of Directors
will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, if necessary,
challenging the validity or applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

6.14 _Exemption from Liability under Section_ __ _ 16(b)_. The Company
and Purchaser agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain
those officers and directors of the Company subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Company Insiders_
"), both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Company
Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection
with the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity
Awards in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to
the provisions of this _Section 6.14_. The Board of Directors of Purchaser
and of the Company, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such
term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall
reasonably promptly, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all
such steps as may be required to cause (in the case of the Company) any
dispositions of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards by the Company
Insiders, and (in the case of Purchaser) any acquisitions of Purchaser Common
Stock by any Company Insiders who, immediately following the Merger, will be
officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law.

6.15 _Bank Merger_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Purchaser, including by causing
the Company Bank to execute, if requested by Purchaser, such certificates or
articles of merger and such other documents and certificates as are necessary,
to effect, immediately following the Effective Time or at such later time as
Purchaser may determine, the Bank Merger pursuant to the Bank Merger
Agreement.

 

6.16 _Assumption of Company Debt_. Purchaser agrees to execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on behalf of the
Surviving Corporation or Purchaser Bank (as the case may be), at or prior to
the Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees and other
instruments required for the due assumption of the Companys or Company
Banks outstanding debt, guarantees, securities and other agreements to the
extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees, securities and other
agreements.

 

6.17 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries

 



-42- 

    

 prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, each of Purchaser and the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

6.18 _Pre-Closing  Actions_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take the actions set forth on _Schedule
6.18_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

6.19 _Redemption of Subsidiary Preferred Shares_. Prior to the Closing
Date, at the request of Purchaser, the Company shall take all actions
required in order to redeem the outstanding preferred shares of United
Financial Business Trust I, a subsidiary of the Company Bank, on a redemption
date specified by Purchaser; provided, that such date is no earlier than the
Closing Date. The Company shall provide Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to
review and to comment on any such documents or instruments and shall take into
account in good faith any such comments as reasonably proposed by Purchaser
or its counsel.

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after approval of the Merger by the
shareholders of the Company:

 

(a) by mutual consent of Purchaser and the Company in a written instrument;

 

(b) by either Purchaser or the Company if any Governmental Entity that must
grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger or
the Bank Merger and such denial has become final and nonappealable or any
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order permanently enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making
illegal the consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger, unless the failure
to obtain a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall be due to the failure of the
party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants
and agreements of such party set forth herein;

(c) by either Purchaser or the Company if the Merger shall not have been
consummated on or before July 15, 2020 (the " _Termination Date_ "), unless
the failure of the Closing to occur by the Termination Date shall be due to
the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or
observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;
_provided_ , that the Termination Date may be extended to October 15, 2020 by
either Purchaser or the Company by written notice to the other party if the
Closing shall not have occurred by July 15, 2020, and on such date, the
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_ has not been satisfied or
waived and each of the other conditions set forth in  _Article_ __ _ VII
_has been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing; _provided_ , that such conditions
would have been satisfied on the Termination Date);

breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or
warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true)
set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a
termination by Purchaser, or Purchaser, in the case of a

 



-45- 

    

 termination by the Company, which breach or failure to be true, either
individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or
failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would constitute,
if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, in the case of a termination by Purchaser, or
_Section_ _ 7.3_, in the case of a termination by the Company, and which is
not cured within the earlier of the Termination Date and forty-five (45) days
following written notice to the Company, in the case of a termination by
Purchaser, or Purchaser, in the case of a termination by the Company, or by
its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period; or

 

(e) by Purchaser, if (i) prior to such time as the Requisite Company Vote
is obtained, the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company (A) submits
this Agreement to its shareholders without a recommendation for approval, or
otherwise withdraws or materially and adversely modifies (or publicly
discloses its intention to withdraw or materially and adversely modify) its
recommendation as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, or recommends to its
shareholders an Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger, or (B) shall have
breached  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ by failing to call and hold the Company
Meeting, as provided therein, or materially breached _Section_ __ _ 6.11_; or
(ii) a tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or more of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock is commenced (other than by Purchaser or a

the shareholders of the Company tender their shares in such tender or exchange
offer or otherwise fails to recommend that such shareholders reject such
tender offer or exchange offer within the ten (10) business day period
specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act;

 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (b), (c),
(d) or (e) of this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.5_,
specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such
termination is effected.

 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Purchaser or
the Company as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Purchaser, the Company,
any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers, directors,
employees, shareholders, agents or representatives of any of them shall have
any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) _ Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_,
this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ and _Article_ __ _ IX_ shall survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Purchaser nor the Company shall
be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
fraud or willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement
occurring prior to termination (which, in the case of the Company, shall
include the loss to the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Equity
Awards of the economic benefits of the Merger, including the loss of the
premium offered to the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Equity
Awards, _it_ _being_ _understood_  that the Company shall be entitled to
pursue damages for such losses and to enforce the right to recover such losses
on behalf of its shareholders and the holders of Company Equity Awards in its
sole and absolute discretion, and any amounts received by the Company in
connection therewith may be retained by the Company).

(b) (i) In the event that after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the termination of this Agreement, a bona fide __ Acquisition Proposal shall
have been made known to senior management of the Company or has been made
directly to its shareholders generally or any person shall have publicly
announced (and not withdrawn) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the
Company and (A) (x) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either
Purchaser or the Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_ without the
Requisite Company Vote having been obtained at the Company Meeting (and all
other conditions set forth in _Sections_ __ _ 7.1_ and _7.3_ had been
satisfied or were capable of being satisfied prior to such termination) or
(y) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 8.1(d)_ as a result of a willful breach of this Agreement, and (B) prior
to the date that is twelve

 



-46- 

    

 (12) months after the date of such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement or consummates a transaction with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall, on the earlier of the date it
enters into such definitive agreement and the date of consummation of such
transaction, pay Purchaser, by wire transfer of same day funds, a fee equal to
$28,278,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ");  _provided_ , that, for purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_, all references in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal to "25%" shall instead refer to "50%."

 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(e)_, then the Company shall pay Purchaser, by wire
transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee within two (2) business days
of the date of termination.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the maximum aggregate
amount of fees, liabilities or damages payable by the Company under this
Agreement shall be equal to the Termination Fee and any amounts payable under
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(d)_. In no event shall the Company be obligated to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(d) Each of Purchaser and the Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly,
if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.2_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Purchaser commences a suit
which results in a judgment against Purchaser or the Company, the Company
shall pay the costs and expenses of Purchaser (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if
the Company fails to pay any amount due pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, then
it shall pay interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of
the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and
ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a
rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" (as announced by JPMorgan Chase and
Co. or any successor thereto) in effect on the date on which such payment was
required to be made, for the period commencing as of the date that such
overdue amount was originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by the
Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_ constitute liquidated damages and
not a penalty, and shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser in
the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in such section.

ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW
AT THE TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER
PROCEEDING, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE,

UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY
MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) __EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER

CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 9.10_.

 

9.11 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations contained herein shall be
assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party. Any purported
assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in  _Section_ __ _ 6.7_,
which is intended to benefit each Company Indemnified Party and his or her
representatives, and subject to the right of the Company to enforce the rights
of its shareholders and the holders of Company Equity Awards pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)_, this Agreement (including the documents and
instruments referred to herein) is not intended to, and does not, confer upon
any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder,
including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth
herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product
of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of
the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice
or liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge
of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may
not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 

9.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or otherwise breached. Accordingly, the
parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof,
including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
(including the parties obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereby further waives (a) __ any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

9.13 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or

 



-50- 

    

 portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
or portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable, so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party hereto.

 

9.14 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_. This Agreement
and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent
signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an
original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or
instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a
".pdf" format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any
amendment hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or email
delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.
