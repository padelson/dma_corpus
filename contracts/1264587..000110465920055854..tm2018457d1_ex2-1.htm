Company Common Stock (the " _Shares_ "), other than the Excluded Shares, for
(i) $11.50 per Share, net to the seller in cash, without interest (the "
_Cash Amount_ "), _plus_ (ii) one contingent value right per Share (each, a "
_CVR_ ") which shall represent the right to receive the Milestone Payment (as
such term is used in the CVR Agreement and subject to the terms of the CVR

set forth in this Agreement, whereby (i) each issued and outstanding Share not
owned by Parent, Purchaser or the Company as of the Effective Time (other
than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right
to receive the Offer Price, in cash, without interest, and (ii) the Company

Milestone Payment or to add additional milestone payments or additional
milestones solely with respect to additional milestone payments. The Offer may

Date) of the Offer without the prior written consent of the Company, unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 8_.

  



  

(c) Expiration and Extension of the Offer. The Offer shall
initially be scheduled to expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time
on the date that is 20 business days (determined as set forth in Rule

Commencement Date (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Company) (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ", and such date or such subsequent
date to which the Initial Expiration Date of the Offer is extended in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to the Parties' respective termination rights under _Section 8_: (i)
if, as of the then-scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not
satisfied (unless such condition is waivable by Purchaser or Parent and has
been waived), Purchaser may, in its discretion (and without the consent of
the Company or any other Person), extend the Offer for additional periods of
up to 10 business days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be
satisfied; (ii) if, as of the then-scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer
Condition is not satisfied (unless such condition is waivable by Purchaser or
Parent and has been waived), at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall,
and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, extend the Offer for additional periods
specified by the Company of up to 10 business days per extension (or such
other period as the Parties may agree), to permit such Offer Condition to be
satisfied; and (iii) Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to,
extend the Offer from time to time for: (A) the minimum period required by
any Legal Requirement, any interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff
thereof or NASDAQ applicable to the Offer and (B) periods of up to 10 business
days per extension, until any waiting period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to and necessary for the consummation of the Offer under the HSR
Act shall have expired or been terminated; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall Parent or Purchaser (1) be required to extend the Offer beyond
the earlier to occur of (x) the valid termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Section 8_ and (y) the End Date (such earlier
occurrence, the " _Extension Deadline_ "), (2) be permitted to extend the
Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without the prior written consent of the
Company or (3) be required to extend the Offer beyond the then-existing
Expiration Date for more than three (3) consecutive additional periods not to
exceed an aggregate of thirty (30) business days, if, as of the applicable
Expiration Date, all of the Offer Conditions are satisfied or have been waived
other than the Minimum Condition and conditions which by their nature are to
be satisfied at the expiration of the Offer.

(d) Termination of Offer. Nothing in this _Section 1.1_ shall be
deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the
Company, Parent or Purchaser to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8_. In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Section 8_, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
immediately, irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall
not acquire any Shares pursuant to the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or
withdrawn by Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
Purchaser shall immediately return, and shall cause any depository acting on
behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Legal
Requirements, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

  



  

(e) Offer Documents. As promptly as practicable on the Offer
Commencement Date, Parent and Purchaser shall, and shall cause A. Menarini -
Industrie Farmaceutiche Riunite S.r.l (the " _Ultimate Parent_ ") to, (i) file
with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with any exhibits, amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Offer Documents_ ") that will contain or incorporate by reference the Offer
to Purchase, form of the related letter of transmittal and summary
advertisement, (ii) make all deliveries, mailings and telephonic notices
required by Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act and (iii) cause the Offer to
Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares as and
to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements. Parent and
Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Offer Documents filed by Ultimate
Parent, Parent or Purchaser with the SEC to (x) comply in all material
respects with the Exchange Act and other applicable Legal Requirements and (y)
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no covenant is made by Ultimate
Parent, Parent or Purchaser with respect to information supplied by or on
behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Offer Documents. Each of Ultimate Parent, Parent, Purchaser and the Company
agrees to respond promptly to any comments (including oral comments) of the
SEC or its staff and to promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Ultimate Parent,
Parent and Purchaser further agree to take all steps necessary to promptly
cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by applicable Legal Requirements. The Company hereby consents to
the inclusion of the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. The
Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make available to Ultimate
Parent, Parent and Purchaser or Parent's legal counsel all information
concerning the Acquired Companies and the Company's stockholders that may be
required or reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated
by this _Section 1.1(e)_. The Company and its counsel shall be given
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
(including any response to any comments (including oral comments) of the SEC
or its staff with respect thereto) prior to the filing thereof with the SEC,
and Ultimate Parent, Parent and Purchaser shall give reasonable consideration
to any such comments made by the Company or its counsel. Ultimate Parent,
Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the Company and its counsel with any
comments (including oral comments) Ultimate Parent, Parent, Purchaser
or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those comments (including oral

(f) Funds. Without limiting the generality of _Section 9.11_,
Parent shall cause to be provided to Purchaser, on a timely basis, all of the
funds necessary to purchase all Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to
purchase pursuant to the Offer, and shall cause Purchaser to perform, on a
timely basis, all of Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement. To the
extent reasonably requested by Parent, the Company shall cooperate with
Parent and/or Purchaser to make a loan or otherwise provide to Parent
or Purchaser available cash of the Company as of the Closing.

  



  

(g) Adjustments. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Offer Acceptance Time, the outstanding Shares are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted, it being understood that,
for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 1.1(g)_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(h) Acceptance. On the terms specified herein and subject only to
the satisfaction or, to the extent waivable by Purchaser or Parent, waiver
by Purchaser or Parent of each of the Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) (i) immediately after the Expiration Date
irrevocably accept for payment all Shares tendered (and not validly withdrawn)
pursuant to the Offer (the time of such acceptance, the " _Offer Acceptance
Time_ ") and (ii) as promptly as practicable after the Offer Acceptance Time
(and in any event within three business days) pay for such Shares.

  



  

(i) CVR Agreement. At or prior to the Offer Acceptance Time,
Parent shall duly authorize, execute and deliver, and shall ensure that the

Parent or its counsel. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its counsel
with any comments (including oral comments) the Company or its counsel may

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or
any stockholder of the Company:

  



  

(i) any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Company (or held in the Company's treasury) shall be cancelled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor;

  



  

(ii) any Shares held immediately prior to the Effective Time by
Parent, Purchaser or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

  



  

(iii) except as provided in _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ above and
subject to _Section 2.5(b)_, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares, which shall have only those
rights set forth in _Section 2.7_, and other than any Shares subject to
vesting or employment based forfeiture conditions (" _Restricted Shares_ "),
which shall be treated in the Merger in accordance with _Section 2.8_) shall
be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), in each case without any interest thereon, and subject to
any withholding of Taxes in accordance with _Section 2.6(e)_; and

  



  

(iv) each share of the common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of
Purchaser then outstanding shall be converted into one share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, subject to
this _Section 2.5(a)_, all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall

by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of shares, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares, reclassification,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration
shall be appropriately adjusted; it being understood that nothing in this
_Section 2.5(b)_ shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
action that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

2.6 Surrender of Certificates; Stock Transfer Books.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent
(the " _Depository Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the
aggregate Cash Amount to which holders of such Shares shall become entitled
pursuant to _Section 1.1(b)_ at the Offer Acceptance Time and to act as
agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the
aggregate Cash Amount to which holders of such Shares shall become entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.5_ at the Effective Time. Promptly after (and in any
event no later than the third business day after) the Offer Acceptance Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Depository
Agent cash sufficient to make payment of the aggregate Cash Amount payable as
part of the aggregate Offer Price payable pursuant to _Section 1.1(h)_. On
or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent cash sufficient to make payment of the
aggregate Cash Amount payable as part of the aggregate Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to _Section 2.5_ (together with the amount
deposited pursuant the immediately preceding sentence, the " _Payment Fund_
"). For the avoidance of doubt, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall be
required to deposit any funds related to any CVR with the Rights Agent unless
and until such deposit is required pursuant to the terms of the CVR Agreement
and no such deposit will be deemed part of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund
shall not be used for any purpose other than to pay the aggregate Cash Amount
payable as part of the aggregate Offer Price in the Offer and the aggregate
Cash Amount payable as part of the Merger Consideration in the Merger. The
Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that such investments shall be (w) in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, (x) in
commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, (y) in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding one billion dollars, or (z) in
money market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted
by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of acquisition or a
combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall
have a maturity exceeding three months. To the extent Parent becomes
aware that (i) there are any losses with respect to any such investments or
(ii) the Payment Fund has diminished for any reason below the level required
for the Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment pursuant to _Section 1.1(h)_
and _Section 2.5_, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, promptly replace or restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure
that the Payment Fund is, at all times during the duration of the Payment
Fund, maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make such
payments pursuant to _Section 1.1(h)_ and _Section 2.5_.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than
three business days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
delivered to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
(i) Shares represented by a certificate evidencing such Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") or (ii) Book-Entry Shares, who, in each case was entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.5_, (A) a form of
letter of transmittal, which shall be in reasonable and customary form and
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section
2.6(f)_, if applicable) to the Paying Agent, or a customary agent's message
in respect to Book-Entry Shares, and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration issuable and payable in respect of such Shares pursuant
to _Section 2.5_. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 2.6(f)_, if
applicable) or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal in
the case of Certificates, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to the instructions, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration for each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall then be
cancelled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the
benefit of the holder thereof. If the payment of any Merger Consideration is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificates formerly evidencing the Shares is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
satisfaction of Parent that such transfer or other similar Taxes either have
been paid or are not applicable. None of Parent, Purchaser and the
Surviving Corporation shall have any liability for the transfer and other
similar Taxes described in this _Section 2.6(b)_ under any circumstance.
Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry
Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares
are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.6_, each
Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration as contemplated by _Section 2.5_.

  



  

(c) At any time following 6 months after the Effective Time,
Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds (with respect to the aggregate Merger Consideration to which
holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.5_) which had
been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (including all interest and other income
received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it),
and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar
Legal Requirements) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares for the Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such share to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Legal Requirements. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at such
time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Body shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its
designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company with respect to the Shares shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the
holders of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as
otherwise provided herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
as provided in this Agreement.

  



  

(e) Each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent and
Purchaser, and their Affiliates, the Paying Agent, the Rights Agent or
the Depository Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from any amounts or other
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the CVR
Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under any
Legal Requirement with respect to Taxes. Any amounts so deducted and withheld
and paid over to the applicable Governmental Body in accordance with
applicable Legal Requirements shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

  



  

(f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of the Shares
formerly represented by that Certificate, or by a representative of that
holder, claiming that Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by that holder of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate (which
shall not exceed the Merger Consideration payable with respect to such
Certificate), the Paying Agent will pay (less any amounts entitled to be
deducted or withheld pursuant to _Section 2.6(e)_), in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration to
be paid in respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated by this _Section 2_.

  



  

2.7 Dissenters' Rights.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and held by holders who are entitled
to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and have properly
exercised and perfected their respective demands for appraisal of such Shares
in the time and manner provided in Section 262 of the DGCL and, as of the
Effective Time, have neither effectively withdrawn nor lost their rights to
such appraisal and payment under the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "),
shall not be converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration, but
shall, by virtue of the Merger, be automatically cancelled and no longer
outstanding, shall cease to exist and shall be entitled to only such
consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL;
_provided_ that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's right to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL, such holder's Shares shall be deemed to have been converted
as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(less any amounts entitled to be deducted or withheld pursuant to _Section
2.6(e)_), and such Shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and Purchaser of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Dissenting Shares,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL, in each case prior to the Effective Time. Parent and
Purchaser shall have the right to direct and participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands, and the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent and Purchaser, settle or offer to
settle, or make any payment with respect to, any such demands, approve any
withdrawal of any such demands or agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

Company, the acceleration of the exercisability of Company Options.

  



  

(g) To the extent a payment pursuant in this _Section 2.8_ would
trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall

penalty.

possession of and to all rights and property of Purchaser and the Company, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully
authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in the name of the Company and
otherwise) to take such action.

3.5 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

  



  

(a) Since January 1, 2018, the Company has filed or furnished on a
timely basis all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
(including exhibits and all other information incorporated therein) required
to be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC (as supplemented,
modified or amended since the time of filing, the " _Company SEC Documents_
"). As of their respective dates, or, if amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of (and giving effect to) the last such amendment
(and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the date
of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), the
Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as
amended (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to those Company SEC
Documents, and, except to the extent that information contained in such
Company SEC Document has been revised, amended, modified or superseded (prior
to the date of this Agreement) by a later filed Company SEC Document, none of
the Company SEC Documents when filed or furnished contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(b) The financial statements (including any related notes and
schedules) contained or incorporated by reference in the Company SEC
Documents: (i) complied as to form in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC applicable thereto; (ii) were
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
covered (except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial
statements or, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, as may
be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, 8-K or any successor form under the
Exchange Act); and (iii) fairly presented, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and the results of operations and cash flows of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby
(subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, to the absence
of notes and to normal and recurring year-end adjustments that are not,
individually or in the aggregate, material). No financial statements of any
Person other than the consolidated Subsidiaries of the Company are required by
GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

  



  

(c) The Company maintains, and at all times since January 1, 2019
has maintained, a system of "internal control over financial reporting" (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act), which is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and that
receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and the Board of Directors; and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the Company
that could have a material effect on its financial statements. The Company's
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's
system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2019, and, except as set forth in the Company SEC
Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, that assessment concluded
that those controls were effective. To the knowledge of the Company, since
January 1, 2019, neither the Company nor the Company's independent
registered accountant has identified or been made aware of: (1) any
significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of the
internal control over financial reporting utilized by the Company, which is
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information; (2) any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves the management or other employees of the Company
who have a significant role in the Company's internal control over
financial reporting or (3) any claim or allegation regarding any of the
foregoing.

  



  

   

17

 



    



  

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures as
defined in and required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that
are reasonably designed to ensure that all information required to be
disclosed in the Company's reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and
to enable the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company to make the certifications required under
the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. The Company is in compliance in
all material respects with all current listing and corporate governance
requirements of NASDAQ.

  



  

(e) The Company is not a party to, nor does it have any obligation
or other commitment to become a party to, "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act) where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company in the Company SEC Documents.

  



  

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to
the Company SEC Documents. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the
Company SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review and there are no
inquiries or investigations by the SEC or any internal investigations pending
or threatened in writing, in each case regarding any accounting practices of
the Company or compliance with federal securities laws.

  



  

(g) Each document required to be filed by the Company with the SEC
in connection with the Offer, including the Schedule 14D-9 (the "
_Company Disclosure Documents_ "), and any amendments or supplements thereto,
when filed, distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Company's
stockholders, as applicable, will comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. The Company Disclosure
Documents, at the time of the filing of such Company Disclosure Documents or
any supplement or amendment thereto with the SEC and at the time such Company
Disclosure Documents or any supplements or amendments thereto are first
distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Company's stockholders, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

  



  

(i) The information with respect to the Company that the Company
furnishes to Parent or Purchaser specifically for use in the Offer
Documents, at the time of the filing of and at the time of any distribution
or dissemination of the Offer Documents, will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no
representation with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Company
Disclosure Documents.

Parent and Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

  



  

4.1 Due Organization. Each of Parent and Purchaser is a
corporation or other Entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize such concept) and has all necessary power and
authority: (a) to conduct its business in the manner in which its business is
currently being conducted; and (b) to own and use its assets in the manner in
which its assets are currently owned and used, except where the failure has
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

   

35

 



    



  

4.2 Purchaser. Purchaser was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the Transactions and activities incidental thereto and has not
engaged, and prior to the Effective Time will not engage, in any business
activities or conducted any operations other than in connection with the
Transactions and those incident to Purchaser's formation. Either Parent or a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent owns beneficially and of record all of the
outstanding capital stock of Purchaser, free and clear of all Encumbrances and
transfer restrictions, except for Encumbrances or transfer restrictions of
general applicability as may be provided under the Securities Act or
applicable securities laws.

  



  

4.3 Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement. Parent and Purchaser
have the corporate power and authority to execute and deliver and perform
their obligations under this Agreement, the CVR Agreement, and to consummate
the Transactions. The board of directors of each of Parent and Purchaser have
approved this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and
Purchaser, respectively, to enter into this Agreement and approved the
execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Purchaser of this
Agreement, the CVR Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions,
including the Offer and the Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Parent and Purchaser, and assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company or the Rights Agent (as the case may be), this
Agreement constitutes, and at the Offer Acceptance Time, the CVR Agreement
will constitute, the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and
Purchaser and is, and at the Offer Acceptance Time, the CVR Agreement will
be, enforceable against Parent and Purchaser in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforcement may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights, and by
general equitable principles.

  



  

4.4 Non-Contravention; Consents.

  



  

(a) Assuming compliance with the applicable provisions of the
DGCL, the HSR Act and any applicable filing, notification or approval in any
foreign jurisdiction required by Antitrust Laws (if any), the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the CVR Agreement by Parent and Purchaser, and
the consummation of the Transactions, will not: (i) cause a violation of any
of the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or other
organizational documents) of Ultimate Parent, Parent or Purchaser; (ii) cause
a violation by Ultimate Parent, Parent or Purchaser of any Legal Requirement
or order applicable to Ultimate Parent, Parent or Purchaser, or to which
Parent or Purchaser are subject; or (iii) require any consent or notice under,
conflict with, result in breach of, or constitute a default under (or an
event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default), or
give rise to any right of purchase, termination, amendment, cancellation,
acceleration or other adverse change of any right or obligation or the loss
of any benefit to which Ultimate Parent, Parent or Purchaser is entitled under
any provision of any Contract, except in the case of _clauses (ii)_ and
_(iii)_ , as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) Except for the filing of the certificate of merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or as may be required by the
Exchange Act (including the filing with the SEC of the Offer Documents),
Takeover Laws, the DGCL, the HSR Act and any applicable filing, notification
or approval in any foreign jurisdiction required by Antitrust Laws (if any)
and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and any national

Affiliates, is required to give notice to, make any filing with or obtain any
Consent from any Governmental Body at any time prior to the Closing in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the CVR
Agreement by Parent or Purchaser, or the consummation by Parent or Purchaser
of the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, except those that the
failure to make or obtain as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No vote of
Ultimate Parent's, Parent's or Purchaser's stockholders is necessary to
approve this Agreement, the CVR Agreement or any of the Transactions
(except in the case of Purchaser as has been obtained prior to the execution
hereof).

4.5 Disclosure. None of the Offer Documents will contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. None of the information with respect to Ultimate Parent, Parent or
Purchaser supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of Ultimate Parent,

Section 5 
 CERTAIN COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY

  



  

5.1 Access and Investigation.

  



  

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8_ (the " _Pre-Closing Period_ "), upon reasonable advance notice
to the Company, the Company shall and shall cause the other Acquired
Companies and the Acquired Companies' Representatives to, provide Parent and
Parent's Representatives with reasonable access (including by electronic
means) during normal business hours of the Company to the Acquired Companies'
Representatives, designated personnel and assets and to all existing books,
records, documents and information relating to the Acquired Companies, and
promptly provide Parent and Parent's Representatives with all reasonably
requested information regarding the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and such additional financial, operating and other data and
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, as Parent may
reasonably request, in each case for any reasonable business purpose related
to the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
such access shall be conducted at Parent's expense, at a reasonable time,
under the supervision of appropriate personnel of the Company and in such a
manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the
business of the Acquired Companies. Nothing herein shall require any Acquired
Company to disclose any information to Parent if such disclosure would, in the
good faith belief of the Acquired Companies (after consultation with outside
counsel) and after notice to Parent (i) jeopardize any attorney-client
or other legal privilege (so long as the Acquired Companies have reasonably
cooperated with Parent to permit such inspection of or to disclose such
information on a basis that does not waive such privilege with respect
thereto, including entering into common interest or joint defense
agreements), (ii) contravene any applicable Legal Requirement (so long as the
Acquired Companies have reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit
disclosure to the extent permitted by Legal Requirements);
_provided, however_ , in the case of _clause (ii)_ , that the Parties shall
cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information to
the extent doing so could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the Acquired
Companies (after consultation with outside counsel)) be managed through the
use of customary "clean room" arrangements pursuant to which Representatives
of Parent could be provided access to such information. With respect to the
information disclosed pursuant to this _Section 5.1_, Parent shall comply
with, and shall instruct Parent's Representatives to comply with, all of its
obligations under the Confidential Disclosure Agreement, dated as of July 19,
2019, between the Company and Ultimate Parent (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

  



  

(b) (i) Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, each of the
Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of (A) any notice or
other communication received by such Party from any Governmental Body in
connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other
Transactions, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is
or may be required in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other
Transactions; or (B) any Legal Proceeding commenced or, to any Party's
knowledge, threatened in writing against, such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to, involving or affecting such Party or
any of its Subsidiaries, in each case in connection with, arising from or
otherwise relating to the Offer, the Merger or any other Transaction, or
affecting the business of such Party or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(ii) (A) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any
change, circumstance, condition, development, effect, event, occurrence or
state of facts that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, or would reasonably be expected to make the
satisfaction of any of the Offer Conditions impossible or unlikely, and (B)
Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of any change, circumstance,
condition, development, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts that has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
or would reasonably be expected to make the satisfaction of any of the
Offer Conditions impossible or unlikely.

  



  

   

39

 



    



  

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 5.1(b)_ shall not cure any breach of any
representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the
date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to any Party. The failure to deliver any such notice shall not
affect any Offer Condition or any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7_
or give rise to any right to terminate under _Section 8_.

  



  

5.2 Operation of the Company's Business. During the Pre-Closing
Period, except (x) as expressly required by this Agreement or as required by
applicable Legal Requirements, (y) with the written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), or (z)
as set forth in _Section 5.2_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule:

  



  

(a) the Company shall and shall cause each of the Acquired
Companies to (i) conduct its business in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to preserve intact its

licenses and business organization and to preserve satisfactory business
relationships with licensors, licensees, lessors, Governmental Bodies and

security (except that the Company may issue Shares as required to be issued
upon the exercise of Company Options or upon the vesting of Company RSUs
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement in accordance with their present
terms or pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP in accordance with its

provision of any of the Employee Plans or grant any Company Associate any
increase in compensation, bonuses or severance, retention or other payments

discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal or any Product Transaction Proposal; (ii) (A)
solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of

any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or any Product Transaction Proposal, (B)
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other Person any information in
connection with, or for the purpose of soliciting or knowingly encouraging or
facilitating, any Acquisition Proposal or any Product Transaction Proposal or
any proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal or any Product Transaction Proposal (other than to
state that the terms of this provision prohibit such discussion), (C)
approve, adopt, endorse or recommend or enter into any letter of intent,
acquisition agreement, agreement in principle or similar agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any Product Transaction Proposal or

has indicated an intention to make any Acquisition Proposal or any Product
Transaction Proposal and all material incorporating such information created
by any such Person.

  



  

(b) If at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time any Acquired Company or any of their
Representatives receives a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal from any
Person or group of Persons, which Acquisition Proposal was made on or after
the date of this Agreement and did not result from a material breach of this
_Section 5.3_, and the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in
a Superior Offer and that the failure to take such action described in
_clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ below would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Legal Requirements, then, notwithstanding anything in
_Section 5.3(a)_ to the contrary, the Company and its Representatives may
(x) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (a copy
which shall be furnished to Parent promptly after the execution thereof),
information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company to
the Person or group of Persons who has made such Acquisition Proposal,
_provided_ that the Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within 24 hours) provide to Parent any information concerning the
Acquired Companies that is provided to any Person to the extent access to such
information was not previously provided to Parent or its Representatives; and
(y) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the
Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , in
the case of _clauses (x)_ and _(y)_ , that at or prior to the first time

(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall (i) promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if any
inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal are received by any Acquired
Company or any of their Representatives and provide to Parent a copy of any
written inquiry or Acquisition Proposal (including any proposed term sheet,
letter of intent, acquisition agreement or other agreement or other supporting

(a) Subject to _Section 6.1(b)_, the Company hereby consents to
the inclusion of a description of the Company Board Recommendation in the
Offer Documents. During the Pre-Closing Period, subject to _Section 6.1(b)_,
neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A)

Company Board Recommendation within three business days after a written
request by Parent to do so (or, if earlier, by the close of business on the
business day immediately preceding the scheduled date of the Offer Acceptance
Time), _provided_ , that Parent may only make such request once with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ , that each time a Determination
Notice is given Parent shall, subject to the following provision, be entitled
to make a new such request); and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company
shall not be required to provide any such affirmation during the four or two
business day periods, as applicable, following the giving of a Determination
Notice, (D) following the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer
relating to the Shares by a Person unaffiliated with Parent, fail to publicly

stockholders reject such tender offer or exchange offer within 10
business days after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or, if earlier,
by the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the
scheduled date of the Offer Acceptance Time) or (E) fail to include the

Recommendation_ ") or (ii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose
to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or cause or allow the Company to
execute or enter into any Contract, letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle or term sheet with respect to, or that
is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the
Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would
otherwise materially impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the
Transactions (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement).

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, and subject to
compliance with the other provisions of this _Section 6.1_:

  



  

   

46

 



    



  

(i) if the Company has received a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal from any Person that has not been withdrawn and after consultation
with outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, the Board of Directors
shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Offer, (x) the Board of Directors may make a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation, or (y) provided that the Company is not in
breach of _Section 5.3_ and in a manner that led to such Acquisition
Proposal and subject to the other provisions of _Section 8.1(e)_,
the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ to
enter into a Specified Agreement with respect to such Superior Offer, in each
case, if and only if: (A) the Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and its financial
advisors, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Board of Directors under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the
Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of its intention to
consider making a Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminating this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ at least four business days prior to
making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation or termination (a "
_Determination Notice_ ") (which notice shall not constitute a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation or termination) and, if requested in writing by
Parent during such four business day period, shall have negotiated, and
caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with respect to
any revisions to the terms of this Agreement or another proposal to the
extent proposed by Parent so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to
constitute a Superior Offer; and (C) (1) the Company shall have provided to
Parent information with respect to such Acquisition Proposal in accordance
with _Section 5.3(c)_, as well as a copy of any acquisition agreement with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal and a copy of any financing commitments
relating thereto (or, if not provided in writing to the Company, a written
summary of the material terms thereof), (2) the Company shall have given
Parent the four business day period after the Determination Notice to propose
revisions to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal so that
such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Offer, and (3)
after giving effect to the proposals made by Parent during such period, if
any, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial
advisors, the Board of Directors shall have determined, in good faith, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer and that the failure
to make the Company Adverse Change Recommendation or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Board of Directors under applicable Legal Requirements. Issuance of
any "stop, look and listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, taking and
disclosing a position or otherwise making any disclosure as is required under
Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act or otherwise complying with applicable Legal Requirements
shall not, in and of itself, be considered a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation and shall not require the giving of a Determination Notice or
compliance with the procedures set forth in this _Section 6.1_. The
provisions of this _Section 6.1(b)(i)_ shall also apply to any change to any
of the financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of
consideration) or other material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal and
require a new Determination Notice ( _provided_ that for the purposes of such
subsequent Determination Notice, all references to "four business days" shall
be deemed to be  "two business days"); and

  



  

(ii) other than in connection with a Superior Offer (which shall
be subject to _Section 6.1(b)(i)_), the Board of Directors may make a
Company Adverse Change Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event if:
(A) the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Company's outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board
of Directors under applicable Legal Requirements; (B) the Company shall have
given Parent a Determination Notice at least four business days prior to
making any such Company Adverse Change Recommendation and, if desired by
Parent, during such four business day period shall have negotiated, and caused
its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with respect to any revisions
to the terms of this Agreement or another proposal to the extent proposed by
Parent so that a Company Adverse Change Recommendation would no longer be
necessary; and (C) (1) the Company shall have specified in reasonable detail
the facts and circumstances that render a Company Adverse Change
Recommendation necessary, (2) the Company shall have given Parent the four
business day period after the Determination Notice to propose revisions
to the terms of this Agreement or make another proposal so that a Company
Adverse Change Recommendation would no longer be necessary, and (3) after
giving effect to the proposals made by Parent during such period, if any,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Board of Directors shall
have determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Company Adverse
Change Recommendation would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
Board of Directors under applicable Legal Requirements. The provisions
of this _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ shall also apply to any material change to the
facts and circumstances specified by the Company pursuant to _clause (C)(1)_
above and require a new Determination Notice ( _provided_ that for the
purposes of such subsequent Determination Notice, all references to "four
business days" shall be deemed to be "two business days").

6.2 Filings, Consents and Approvals.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree to use their reasonable best efforts to take
promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under the Antitrust Laws, that may be asserted by any Governmental
Body, so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable, but in
no case later than the End Date, including providing as promptly as
reasonably practicable and advisable all non-legally privileged information
reasonably required by any Governmental Body pursuant to its evaluation of
the Transactions under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Law. Subject
to the terms of this _Section 6.2_, the Parties shall use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain from any Governmental Body all consents,
approvals authorizations or orders required to be obtained under the
Antitrust Laws or to avoid the entry or enactment of any injunction or other
order or decree relating to any Antitrust Law that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and
its Affiliates shall not be required to, and without the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company, or the Acquired Companies shall not, sell,
license, divest or dispose of or hold separate (through the establishment of a
trust or otherwise) or agree to any other structural, behavioral or conduct
remedy, before or after the Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time,
any entities, businesses, divisions, operations, products or product lines,
assets, Intellectual Property Rights or businesses of Parent, the Company (or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates) or agree to any
restriction on the conduct of such businesses which (A) would materially and
adversely affect the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or (B) would require the sale, license, divestiture, disposal, or
holding separate of, or any other structural, behavioral or conduct remedy
involving the E-Product or the Product Candidates. Nothing in this _Section
6.2_ shall require the Parent or the Company, or the Acquired Companies, to
take or agree to take any action unless the effectiveness of such action is
conditioned upon Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing and any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent,
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries be obligated
to litigate or participate in the litigation of any action, whether judicial
or administrative, brought by any Governmental Body challenging or seeking to
restrain, prohibit or place conditions on the consummation of
the Transactions.

  



  

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates, if
applicable, to): (i) as promptly as reasonably practicable (but no later than
10 business days after the date of this Agreement, unless otherwise mutually
agreed to by the Parties), make an appropriate filing of all Notification and
Report forms as required by the HSR Act, with respect to the Transactions and
(ii) cooperate with each other in determining whether, and as promptly as
reasonably practical preparing and making, any other filings, notifications
or other consents are required to be made with, or obtained from, any other
Governmental Bodies in connection with the Transactions.

  



  

   

48

 



    



  

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this
_Section 6.2_, during the Pre-Closing Period, each Party shall (i) give the
other Parties prompt notice of the making or commencement of any request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding brought by a Governmental
Body or brought by a third party before any Governmental Body, in each case,
with respect to the Transactions under the Antitrust Laws, (ii) keep the other
Parties reasonably informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iii) promptly inform the
other Parties of, and wherever practicable give the other party reasonable
advance notice of, and the opportunity to participate in, any communication
to or from the FTC, DOJ or any other Governmental Body in connection with any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, (iv)
promptly furnish to the other Party, subject to an
appropriate confidentiality agreement to limit disclosure to counsel and
outside consultants, with copies of documents provided to or received from
any Governmental Body in connection with any such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding (except that documents, including
"4(c) and 4(d) documents" as that term is used under the HSR Act, that
contain valuation information or information not related in any way to the
Transactions can be redacted), (v) subject to an appropriate confidentiality
agreement to limit disclosure to counsel and outside consultants, and to the
extent reasonably practicable, consult and cooperate with the other Parties
and consider in good faith the views of the other Parties in connection with
any written analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument,
opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding, and (vi) except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Body or by any Legal Requirement, in connection
with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding in
respect of the Transactions, give the other Party reasonable prior notice and
permit outside counsel for the other Party to be present at each meeting or
conference, including by telephone, relating to such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or Legal Proceeding and to have access to and
be consulted in advance in connection with any argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted to any Governmental Body in connection with such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or Legal Proceeding.

  



  

(d) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall to the extent
permissible under applicable Legal Requirements and reasonably
practicable and where doing so would not reasonably be expected to impair or
adversely affect the Company, any of its plans with respect to the E-Product
or the Product Candidates or its ability to interact with any Governmental
Body consistent with companies at similar stages of development in the
pharmaceutical industry (in each case as determined in good faith by the
Company) (i) offer Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company prior
to any proposed material meeting or other material communication with the
FDA, EMA, CMS or any other Specified Governmental Body relating to the
E-Product or any Product Candidate or material Governmental Authorization (it
being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to delay or
modify any of its actions as a result of this _Section 6.2(d)_), (ii)
promptly inform Parent of, and provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to
review, in advance, any material filing, material correspondence or other
material communication proposed to be submitted by or on behalf of the Company
to the FDA, EMA, CMS or any other Specified Governmental Body by or on behalf
of the Company, in each case relating to the E-Product or any
Product Candidate or material Governmental Authorization (it being understood
that in no event shall the Company be required to delay any such filings,
correspondence or communication), (iii) keep Parent reasonably informed of any
material communication (written or oral) with or from the FDA, EMA, CMS or
any other Specified Governmental Body or relating to the E-Product or any
Product Candidate or Governmental Authorization and (iv) promptly inform
Parent and provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity (but no more than two
business days, to the extent practicable) to comment, in each case, prior to
making any material change to any study protocol, adding any new trial,
making any material change to a manufacturing plan or process, making any
material change to a development timeline or initiating, or making any
material change to, commercialization and reimbursement activities or
materials (including promotional and marketing activities and materials)
relating to the E-Product or any Product Candidate. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent of any significant data relating to the E-Product or
any Product Candidate, including information related to any significant
adverse events with respect to the E-Product or any Product Candidate, in each
case which it discovers after the date hereof.

  



  

   

49

 



    



  

(e) Neither Party shall enter into any agreement, transaction, or
any agreement to effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition)
that would reasonably be expected to make it materially more difficult, or to
materially increase the time required, to (i) obtain the expiration or
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, (ii) avoid the entry of,
the commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order
that would materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (iii) obtain all authorizations,
consents, orders and approvals of Governmental Bodies necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

6.3 Employee Benefits.

  



  

(a) For a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the one year anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide,
or cause to be provided, to those employees of the Company who are employed
by the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continue
to be actively employed by the Surviving Corporation (or any Affiliate
thereof) during such period (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) the
base salary or wage rate and annual cash bonus opportunities (excluding
equity-based compensation opportunities) that are, in each case, no less than
those provided by the Company immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance
Time; (ii) retirement and welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided by the Company immediately prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time; and (iii) severance benefits no less favorable than those
provided to by the Company immediately prior to the Offer Acceptance Time.

  



  

(b) For a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on
the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent agrees that
all Continuing Employees shall be eligible to continue to participate in the
Surviving Corporation's health and welfare benefit plans (to the same extent
such Continuing Employees were eligible to participate under the health and
welfare benefit plans of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time); _provided, however_ , that (i) nothing in this _Section 6.3_ or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to amend or terminate any such health or welfare benefit plan at
any time, subject to the requirements set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_, and (ii)
if Parent or the Surviving Corporation terminates any such health or welfare
benefit plan (upon expiration of any appropriate transition period), then the
Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Surviving
Corporation's (or an Affiliate's) health and welfare benefit plans to the
extent that coverage under such plans is replacing comparable coverage under
an Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately
before the Effective Time. To the extent that service is relevant under any
benefit plan of Parent or an Affiliate and/or the Surviving Corporation, then
Parent shall ensure that such benefit plan shall, for all purposes, credit
Continuing Employees for service prior to the Effective Time with the Company
and its Affiliates or their respective predecessors; _provided_ , that, if
such benefit plan replaces a benefit plan of the Company that
recognized service for the same purpose, such service will be recognized to
the same extent that such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time
under the corresponding benefit plan of the Company. Nothing in this _Section
6.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in
any Person to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other Affiliate of the Surviving Corporation and the employment of each
Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment.

  



  

   

50

 



    



  

(c) To the extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements,
with respect to any employee benefit plans maintained for the benefit of the
Continuing Employees following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation, any of its Affiliates, and any successor
thereto, to (i) cause there to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-
existing condition limitations or waiting period requirements to the same
extent waived or satisfied under comparable plans of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible, co-
insurance and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, amounts paid by such
employees during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs under
similar plans maintained by the Company.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.3_ are solely for the
benefit of the Parties, and no provision of this _Section 6.3_ is intended
to, or shall, constitute the establishment or adoption of or an amendment to
any employee benefit plan for purposes of ERISA or otherwise, and no current
or former employee or any other individual associated therewith shall be
regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement or
have the right to enforce the provisions hereof.

  



  

6.4 ESPP. As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall take all necessary actions under the Company
ESPP to provide that (a) the "Offering Period" (as defined in the Company
ESPP) in effect as of the date of this Agreement shall be the final Offering
Period (such period, the " _Final Offering Period_ ") and no further Offering
Period shall commence pursuant to the Company ESPP after the date of this
Agreement, (b) the  "Purchase Period" (as defined in the Company ESPP) in
effect as of the date of this Agreement shall be the final Purchase Period
(such period, the " _Final Purchase Period_ ") and no further Purchase Period
shall commence pursuant to the Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement,
and (c) no individual participating in the Final Purchase Period on the date
of this Agreement shall be permitted to (i) increase his or her payroll
contribution rate pursuant to the Company ESPP from the rate in effect when
the Final Purchase Period commenced or (ii) make separate non-
payroll contributions to the Company ESPP on or following the date of this
Agreement, except as may be required by applicable Legal Requirement. Prior
to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all action that may be
necessary to, effective upon the Offer Acceptance Time, (A) cause the Final
Offering Period and Final Purchase Period to be terminated no later than five
business days prior to the date on which the Offer Acceptance Time occurs, if
the Final Offering Period and Final Purchase Period have not otherwise
terminated pursuant to the Company ESPP prior to such date (and the early
termination date of the Final Purchase Period shall be the "New Purchase
Date" (as defined in the Company ESPP) for purposes of each then-outstanding
Option (as defined in the Company ESPP)); (B) make any prorating adjustments
that may be necessary to reflect a truncated Final Offering Period and Final
Purchase Period, but otherwise treat the Final Offering Period and Final
Purchase Period as a fully effective and completed Offering Period and
Purchase Period, respectively, for all purposes pursuant to the Company ESPP;
and (C) cause the exercise of each outstanding Option as of the New Purchase
Date . On such exercise date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as
of such date pursuant to the Company ESPP within each participant's payroll
withholding account to the purchase of Shares in accordance with the terms of
the Company ESPP, and each Share shall be an outstanding Share and entitled
to the Merger Consideration. The Company shall adopt such resolutions as are
necessary to terminate the Company ESPP effective as of immediately prior to,
and conditional upon the occurrence of, the Offer Acceptance Time, and shall
notify each participant in the Company ESPP of the New Purchase Date
in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP.

  



  

   

51

 



    



  

6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

  



  

(a) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent
agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time) now existing in favor of the current or former directors or
officers of each of the Acquired Companies under the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or other applicable governing documents and any
indemnification or other similar agreements of such Acquired Company set
forth on _Section 6.5(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in each
case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms and shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any Indemnified Person (as defined below), and Parent shall
cause the Acquired Companies to perform their obligations thereunder. Without
limiting the foregoing, during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, and the Surviving
Corporation agrees that it will, indemnify and hold harmless each individual
who is as of the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time, a director or officer of any Acquired Company or who is as of the date
of this Agreement, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time,
serving at the request of any Acquired Company as a director or officer of
another Person (the " _Indemnified Persons_ "), against all claims, losses,
liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs
and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (including with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including this
Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), arising out
of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was a director
or officer of any Acquired Company or is or was serving at the request of any
Acquired Company as a director or officer of another Person, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Legal Requirements. In the event of any
such claim, action, suit or proceeding, (x) each Indemnified Person will be
entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim,
action, suit or proceeding from Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, in accordance with the organizational documents
and any indemnification or other similar agreements of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries set forth on _Section 6.5(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ that any Indemnified Person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the
DGCL or the Surviving Corporation's or any of its Subsidiaries' certificate
of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or any
such indemnification or other similar agreements, as applicable; to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined by final adjudication that
such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification and (y) Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall
reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

  



  

   

52

 



    



  

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in
effect the current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance
maintained by the Acquired Companies or provide substitute policies for the
Acquired Companies and their current and former directors and officers who are
currently covered by the directors' and officers' insurance coverage
currently maintained by the Acquired Companies, in either case, of not less
than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to the
insured persons than the directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by the Acquired Companies with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred at or before the Effective Time
(with insurance carriers having at least an "A" rating by A.M. Best with
respect to directors' and officers' liability insurance), except that in no
event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to pay with
respect to such insurance policies an annual premium greater than 300% of the
aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Acquired Companies prior to
the date of this Agreement as set forth on  _Section 6.5(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if the
Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the insurance required by this
_Section 6.5(b)_ it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible
for the years within such six year period for a premium equal to the Maximum
Amount. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the Closing Date the Company may
purchase a "tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance policy for the
Acquired Companies and their current and former directors and officers who are
currently covered by the directors' and officers' liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by the Acquired Companies, such tail to provide
coverage in an amount not less than the existing coverage and to have other
terms not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Acquired
Companies with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no event shall the cost of
any such tail policy exceed the Maximum Amount. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and
continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

  



  

(c) In the event that any Acquired Company or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or Entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the
Acquired Company, as applicable, shall cause proper provision to be made so
that the successors and assigns of such Acquired Company assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.5_.

  



  

   

53

 



    



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.5_ (i) shall survive the
acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation
of the Merger and (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be
enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Indemnified
Persons), his or her heirs, successors, assigns and representatives, and
(iii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses, exculpation or contribution that
any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Unless required by
applicable Legal Requirement, this _Section 6.5 _may not be amended, altered
or repealed after the Offer Acceptance Time in such a manner as to adversely
affect the rights of any Indemnified Person or any of their successors,
assigns or heirs without the prior written consent of the affected
Indemnified Person.

  



  

6.6 Stockholder Litigation. In the event that any litigation
related to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions is
brought by any stockholder or other holder of Company securities (whether
directly or on behalf of the Company or otherwise) against the Company and/or
its directors or officers, the Company shall promptly notify Parent and shall
keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status
thereof. The Company shall give Parent the (a) opportunity to participate in

settlement with respect to such litigation, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without Parent's prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event shall
Parent be required to consent to any such settlement that does not provide for
the unconditional release of Parent, its Affiliates and Representatives and
all Persons entitled to indemnification by Parent or the Company, in each
case from any liability in connection with such litigation; _provided further_
, that the Company shall otherwise control the defense and/or settlement and
the disclosure of information in connection therewith shall be subject to the

terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party to this Agreement shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to (a) make all filings (if any) and give

any Material Contract in connection with the Offer and the Merger and the
other Transactions to the extent requested in writing by Parent, (b) seek each
Consent (if any) required to be obtained pursuant to any Material Contract by
such Party in connection with the Transactions to the extent requested in
writing by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , each of the Parties acknowledges

itself, be a condition to the Offer or the Merger and (c) seek to lift
any restraint, injunction or other legal bar to the Offer or the Merger
brought by any third Person against such Party. Notwithstanding anything in
this _Section 6.7_ to the contrary, neither Parent, the Company nor any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any consent or other
similar fee, payment or consideration, make any other concession or provide
any additional security (including a guaranty), to obtain any third party
consents.

with each other before issuing any further press release(s) or otherwise
making any public statement or making any announcement to Company Associates
(to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this
Agreement) with respect to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the
other Transactions and shall not issue any such press release, public
statement or announcement to Company Associates without the other

consultation or consent, make any public statement in response to questions
from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences,
make internal announcements to employees and make disclosures in Company SEC
Documents, so long as such statements substantially reiterate (and are not
inconsistent with) previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by the Parties (or individually, if approved by the
other Party); (b) a Party may, without the prior consent of the other Party
but subject to giving advance notice to the other Party and consulting with
the other Party with respect to the content thereof, issue any such press
release or make any such public announcement or statement that,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, is determined to be required
by Legal Requirement; (c) the Company need not consult with Parent in
connection with such portion of any press release, public statement or filing
to be issued or made pursuant to  _Section 5.3(d)_; and (d) neither Party
need consult with the other in connection with such portion of any
press release, public statement or filing to be issued with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or Company Adverse Change Recommendation (but without
limiting the Company's obligations under _Section 5.3 _or _Section 6.1_).

  



  

6.9 Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport
to be, applicable to the Transactions, each of Parent and the Company and the
members of their respective Boards of Directors shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby and otherwise act
to lawfully eliminate the effect of any Takeover Law on any of
the Transactions.

Affiliates entering into any such arrangement with any of the officers,
directors or employees of the Company, Parent will provide to the Company any
and all information concerning such arrangements as may be needed by
the Company to comply with this _Section 6.11_. Parent and its counsel shall

terminates participation in the Company 401(k) Plan in accordance with the
preceding sentence, (1) prior to the Effective Time and thereafter (as
applicable), the Company and Parent shall take any and all actions as may be
required, including amendments to the tax-qualified defined contribution
retirement plan designated by Parent (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_") to permit
each Continuing Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code,

a combination thereof, in an amount equal to the full account balance

401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan and (2) each Continuing Employee shall
become a participant in the Parent 401(k) Plan on the Closing Date (giving

58

 



    



  

8.3 Expenses; Termination Fees.

  



  

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses, whether or
not the Offer and Merger are consummated.

  



  

(b) In the event that:

  



  

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)_, the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds prior to or simultaneously
with (and as a condition to the effectiveness of) such termination;

  



  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(d)_, the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the Termination Fee
by wire transfer of same day funds within one business day after such
termination; or

  



  

(iii) (x) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ (but in the case of a termination by the
Company, only if at such time Parent would not be prohibited from terminating
this Agreement pursuant to the proviso to _Section 8.1(b)_), by Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_ resulting from a material breach of any
covenant in this Agreement or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_, (y) any
Person shall have publicly disclosed a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal or
Significant Product Transaction Proposal, or such Acquisition Proposal or
Significant Product Transaction Proposal has otherwise been communicated to
the Board of Directors or the Company's stockholders and shall have become
publicly known, after the date hereof and prior to such termination and such
Acquisition Proposal or Significant Product Transaction Proposal has not been
unconditionally withdrawn at least ten (10) business days prior to such
termination and (z) within twelve (12) months of such termination the Board
of Directors shall have approved or recommended any Acquisition Proposal or
Significant Product Transaction Proposal (in each case, regardless of when
made), and the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Significant Product Transaction
Proposal ( _provided_ that for purposes of this _clause (z)_ the references
to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be
references to "50%"), the Company shall pay to Parent or its designee the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds prior to the consummation
of such Acquisition Proposal or Significant Product Transaction Proposal.

  



  

(c) It is understood that in no event shall the Company be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. As used
herein,  " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to $25,400,000.
In any circumstance in which the Termination Fee becomes due and payable and
is paid by the Company in accordance with this _Section 8.3_, the Termination
Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for, and the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy available to Parent and Purchaser in connection with, any and
all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Purchaser, any of their
respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this Agreement
(collectively, " _Parent Related Parties_ ") (and the termination
hereof), the Transactions (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming
the basis for such termination, and none of Parent, Purchaser or any of their
respective Affiliates shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action
or proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement, any of the Transactions or any matters
forming the basis for such termination, _provided_ that none of the foregoing
under this _Section 8.3(c)_ shall relieve the Company for any liability for
fraud or willful and material breach of this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent and Purchaser may seek specific performance to cause the
Company to consummate the Transactions in accordance with _Section 9.5_ and
the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.3(c)_, but in
no event shall Parent or Purchaser be entitled to both (i) specific
performance to cause the Company to consummate the Transactions in accordance
with _Section 9.5_ and (ii) the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to
this _Section 8.3(c)_.

  



   

59

 



    

  



  

(d) In a circumstance in which the Termination Fee becomes due and
payable and it and other payments the Company is required to make to Parent
are paid in accordance with this _Section 8.3_, such payments shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the Company
and any of their respective former, current or future officers, directors,
partners, stockholders, optionholders, managers, members or Affiliates

  

(collectively, " _Company Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a
result of the failure of the Offer or the Merger to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such
amount(s), none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions; _provided_ none of the foregoing under this  _Section 8.3(d)_
shall relieve the Company from any liability for fraud or willful and material
breach of this Agreement.

  



  

(e) The Parties acknowledge (i) that the agreements contained in
this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Purchaser in the
circumstances in which such payment is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
Transactions and (iii) that, without these agreements, the Parties would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay
any amount due pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_, and, in order to obtain the
payment, Parent commences a Legal Proceeding which results in a judgment
against the Company, the Company shall pay Parent its reasonable and
documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys'
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount at
the prime rate as published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was
actually received plus 2%, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements.

  



  

Section 9

  

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

  



  

9.1 Amendment. Prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, this Agreement
may be amended with the approval of the respective Boards of Directors of the
Company, Parent and Purchaser at any time; _provided_ that, following the
consummation of the Offer, this Agreement may not be amended in any manner
that causes the Merger Consideration to differ from the Offer Price. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the Parties.

  



   

60

 



    

  



  

9.2 Waiver. No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the
part of any Party in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under
this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy. No single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or
remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have
waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim,
power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written
instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Party and any such
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure. At any time prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time, Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive any breach of the
representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other with
any of the agreements or covenants contained herein. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if is expressly set forth in a written instrument
duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Party or Parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure. The rights and remedies provided herein shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by any Legal Requirement except
to the extent set forth in _Section 8.3(d)_.

  



  

9.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Schedule or in any certificate or schedule or other document
delivered by any Person pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger.

  



  

9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts. This Agreement (including its
Exhibits, Annexes and the Company Disclosure Schedule), the CVR Agreement,
the Support Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among or between any of the Parties and their respective Affiliates,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement except
that the restrictions on contact and restrictions on disclosure (to the extent
to be included in SEC filings in connection with the Transactions) in the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate immediately following the execution
and delivery of this Agreement solely for purposes of permitting the actions
contemplated hereby to be consummated. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, including by facsimile or by email with .pdf
attachments, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties.

  



  

   

61

 



    



  

9.5 Applicable Legal Requirements; Jurisdiction; Specific
Performance; Remedies.

  



  

(a) This Agreement and any disputes arising from or relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions (whether based in contract, tort, or
otherwise) shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. In any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions: (i) each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom or, if
(but only if) such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States
District Court sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware and any
appellate court therefrom (collectively, the " _Delaware Courts_ "); and (ii)
each of the Parties irrevocably consents to service of process by first class
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to the address at
which such Party is to receive notice in accordance with _Section 9.9_. Each
of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally (1) agrees not to commence any
such action or proceeding except in the Delaware Courts, (2) agrees that any
claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in the Delaware Courts, (3) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
jurisdiction or laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in the
Delaware Courts and (4) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in the Delaware Courts. The Parties agree that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
the foregoing shall restrict any Party's rights to seek any post-judgment
relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

  



  

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the Parties do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to the following sentence, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief, to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in _Section 9.5(a)_ without proof
of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled under this Agreement, and (ii) the right of specific
performance is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. The
right to specific enforcement hereunder shall include the right of the
Company, on behalf of itself and any third party beneficiaries to this
Agreement, to cause Parent and Purchaser to cause the Offer, the Merger and
the other Transactions to be consummated on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy
at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or equity. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this _Section 9.5(b)_ shall not be required to provide any
bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

  



   

62

 



    



  

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM, ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE
ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE

(h) the Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with
its terms (the " _Termination Condition_ ").

  



  

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of,
the rights of Parent and Purchaser to extend, terminate or modify the Offer
pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The foregoing conditions are for the
sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser, may be asserted by Parent or
Purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such conditions
(including any action or inaction by Parent or Purchaser) and (except for the
Minimum Condition) may be waived by Parent and Purchaser, in whole or in part,
at any time and from time to time, in the sole and absolute discretion of
Parent and Purchaser. The failure by Parent or Purchaser at any time
to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any
such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

by the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the

 _SIXTH_ : The Corporation shall provide indemnification as follows:

  



  

 _Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Stemline Therapeutics,
Inc._

  



  

   

 



    



  

(1) _Actions, Suits and Proceedings Other than by or in the Right of the
Corporation_. The Corporation shall indemnify each person who was or is
a party or threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation)
by reason of the fact that he or she is or was, or has agreed to become, a
director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or has agreed
to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director, officer, partner,
employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with, another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise (including any employee
benefit plan) (all such persons being referred to hereafter as an
"Indemnitee"), or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or
omitted in such capacity, against all expenses (including attorneys' fees),
liabilities, losses, judgments, fines, excise taxes and penalties arising
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and amounts paid
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom,
if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner that Indemnitee reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation,
and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable
cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any
action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon
a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create
a presumption that Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner that
Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was
unlawful.

  



  

(2) _Actions or Suits by or in the Right of the Corporation_. The
Corporation shall indemnify any Indemnitee who was or is a party to or
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action
or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in
its favor by reason of the fact that Indemnitee is or was, or has agreed to
become, a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving, or
has agreed to serve, at the request of the Corporation, as a director,
officer, partner, employee or trustee of, or in a similar capacity with,
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
(including any employee benefit plan), or by reason of any action alleged to
have been taken or omitted in such capacity, against all expenses
(including attorneys' fees) and, to the extent permitted by law, amounts paid
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding and any appeal therefrom,
if Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner that Indemnitee reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation,
except that no indemnification shall be made under this Section (2) in
respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which Indemnitee shall have been
adjudged to be liable to the Corporation, unless, and only to the extent, that
the Court of Chancery of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit
was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of
such liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee
is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses (including
attorneys' fees) that the Court of Chancery of Delaware or such other court
shall deem proper.

  



  

(3) _Indemnification for Expenses of Successful Party_. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Article SIXTH, to the extent that an Indemnitee has
been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding referred to in Sections (1) and (2) of this Article SIXTH, or in
defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, or on appeal from any such
action, suit or proceeding, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all
expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by or
on behalf of Indemnitee in connection therewith. Without limiting the
foregoing, Indemnitee shall be considered for the purposes hereof to have been
wholly successful with respect to any action, suit or proceeding, or in
defense of any claim, issue or matter therein or any appeal therefrom,
that is disposed of, on the merits or otherwise (including a disposition
without prejudice), without (i) the disposition being adverse to Indemnitee,
(ii) an adjudication that Indemnitee was liable to the Corporation, (iii) a
plea of guilty or nolo contendere by Indemnitee, (iv) an adjudication that
Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and
(v) with respect to any criminal proceeding, an adjudication that Indemnitee
had reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful.

  



  

 _Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Stemline Therapeutics,
Inc._

  



  

   

 



    



  

(4) _Notification and Defense of Claim_. As a condition precedent to an
Indemnitee's right to be indemnified, such Indemnitee must notify the
Corporation in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding
or investigation involving such Indemnitee for which indemnity will or could
be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of
which the Corporation is so notified, the Corporation will be entitled to
participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at
its own expense, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee.
After notice from the Corporation to Indemnitee of its election so to
assume such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee for
any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee in connection
with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, other than as provided
below in this Section (4). Indemnitee shall have the right to employ his or
her own counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, but the fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after
notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall
be at the expense of Indemnitee unless (i) the employment of counsel by
Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii) counsel to Indemnitee
shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or
position on any significant issue between the Corporation and Indemnitee in
the conduct of the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation
or (iii) the Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume
the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in each of
which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for Indemnitee shall be at the
expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise expressly provided by this
Article SIXTH. The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of
Indemnitee, to assume the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of
the Corporation or as to which counsel for Indemnitee shall have
reasonably made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii) above. The
Corporation shall not be required to indemnify Indemnitee under this Article
SIXTH for any amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation effected without its written consent. The Corporation shall not
settle any action, suit, proceeding or investigation in any manner that would
impose any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee's written
consent. Neither the Corporation nor Indemnitee will unreasonably withhold or
delay its consent to any proposed settlement.

  



  

(5) _Advancement of Expenses_. Subject to the provisions of Section (6) of
this Article SIXTH, in the event of any threatened or pending action, suit,
proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation receives notice under
this Article SIXTH, any expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by or
on behalf of Indemnitee in defending an action, suit, proceeding or
investigation or any appeal therefrom shall be paid by the Corporation in
advance of the final disposition of such matter; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the payment of such expenses incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee
in advance of the final disposition of such matter shall be made only upon
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of Indemnitee to repay all amounts
so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined by final
judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that
Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized
in this Article SIXTH; and _provided_ , _further_ , that no such advancement
of expenses shall be made under this Article SIXTH if it is determined (in
the manner described in Section (6)) that (i) Indemnitee did not act in good
faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed
to, the best interests of the Corporation, or (ii) with respect to any
criminal action or proceeding, Indemnitee had reasonable cause to believe his
or her conduct was unlawful. Such undertaking shall be accepted without
reference to the financial ability of Indemnitee to make such repayment.

  



  

 _Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Stemline Therapeutics,
Inc._

  



  

   

 



    



  

(6) _Procedure for Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_. In order to
obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to Section (1),
(2), (3) or (5) of this Article SIXTH, an Indemnitee shall submit to the
Corporation a written request. Any such advancement of expenses shall be made
promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of
the written request of Indemnitee, unless (i) the Corporation has assumed the
defense pursuant to Section (4) of this Article SIXTH (and none of the
circumstances described in Section (4) of this Article SIXTH that would
nonetheless entitle the Indemnitee to indemnification for the fees and
expenses of separate counsel have occurred) or (ii) the Corporation
determines within such 60-day period that Indemnitee did not meet the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section (1), (2) or (5) of this
Article SIXTH, as the case may be. Any such indemnification, unless ordered by
a court, shall be made with respect to requests under Section (1) or (2) only
as authorized in the specific case upon a determination by the Corporation
that the indemnification of Indemnitee is proper because Indemnitee has met
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section (1) or (2), as the
case may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance (a) by a
majority vote of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who
are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding in question
(the "disinterested directors"), whether or not a quorum, (b) by a committee
of disinterested directors designated by majority vote of disinterested
directors, whether or not a quorum, (c) if there are no disinterested
directors, or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal
counsel (who may, to the extent permitted by law, be regular legal counsel to
the Corporation) in a written opinion, or (d) by the stockholders of the
Corporation.

  



  

(7) _Remedies_. The right to indemnification or advancement of expenses as
granted by this Article SIXTH shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any court
of competent jurisdiction. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made
a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification
is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the
applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation pursuant to Section (6) of this Article SIXTH that Indemnitee has
not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action
or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard
of conduct. In any suit brought by Indemnitee to enforce a right to
indemnification, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of
expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall have
the burden of proving that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or
to such advancement of expenses, under this Article SIXTH. Indemnitee's
expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred in connection with
successfully establishing Indemnitee's right to indemnification, in whole or
in part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any suit brought by Indemnitee to enforce a
right to indemnification hereunder it shall be a defense that the Indemnitee
has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the
DGCL.

  



  

 _Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Stemline Therapeutics,
Inc._

  



  

   

 



    



  

(8) _Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article
SIXTH, except as set forth in Section (7) of this Article SIXTH,
the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee pursuant to this Article
SIXTH in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
Indemnitee unless the initiation thereof was approved by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Article SIXTH, the Corporation shall not indemnify an Indemnitee to the
extent such Indemnitee is reimbursed from the proceeds of insurance, and in
the event the Corporation makes any indemnification payments to an
Indemnitee and such Indemnitee is subsequently reimbursed from the proceeds
of insurance, such Indemnitee shall promptly refund indemnification payments
to the Corporation to the extent of such insurance reimbursement.

  



  

(9) _Subsequent Amendment_. No amendment, termination or repeal of this
Article SIXTH or of the relevant provisions of the DGCL or any other
applicable laws shall adversely affect or diminish in any way the rights of
any Indemnitee to indemnification under the provisions hereof with respect to
any action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or relating to
any actions, transactions or facts occurring prior to the final adoption of
such amendment, termination or repeal.

  



  

(10) _Other Rights_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided by this Article SIXTH shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which an Indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of
expenses may be entitled under any law (common or statutory), agreement or
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in Indemnitee's official capacity and as to action in any
other capacity while holding office for the Corporation, and shall continue
as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer, and shall
inure to the benefit of the estate, heirs, executors and administrators of
Indemnitee. Nothing contained in this Article SIXTH shall be deemed to
prohibit, and the Corporation is specifically authorized to enter into,
agreements with officers and directors providing indemnification rights and
procedures different from those set forth in this Article SIXTH. In addition,
the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by its Board
of Directors, grant indemnification rights to other employees or agents of
the Corporation or other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may
be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those set forth in this Article
SIXTH.

  



  

(11) _Partial Indemnification_. If an Indemnitee is entitled under any
provision of this Article SIXTH to indemnification by the Corporation for some
or a portion of the expenses (including attorneys' fees), liabilities,
losses, judgments, fines (including excise taxes and penalties arising under
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974) or amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in
connection with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation and any appeal
therefrom but not, however, for the total amount thereof, the Corporation
shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion of such expenses
(including attorneys' fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines (including
excise taxes and penalties arising under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974) or amounts paid in settlement to which Indemnitee is
entitled.

  



  

 _Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Stemline Therapeutics,
Inc._

  



  

   

 



    



  

(12) _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise (including any employee benefit plan) against any expense,
liability or loss incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out
of his or her status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the
power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under
the DGCL.

  



  

(13) _Savings Clause_. If this Article SIXTH or any portion hereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each Indemnitee as to any expenses
(including attorneys' fees), liabilities, losses, judgments, fines
(including excise taxes and penalties arising under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974) and amounts paid in settlement in connection
with any action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, including an action by or in the right of the Corporation, to
the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article SIXTH
that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law.

  



  

(14) _Definitions_. Terms used herein and defined in Section 145(h) and
Section 145(i) of the DGCL shall have the respective meanings assigned
to such terms in such Section 145(h) and Section 145(i).

  



  

 _SEVENTH_ : Except to the extent that the DGCL prohibits the elimination or
limitation of liability of directors for breaches of fiduciary duty, no
director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or
its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, notwithstanding any provision of law imposing such liability. No
amendment to or repeal of this provision shall apply to or have any effect on
the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or
with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to
such amendment or repeal. If the DGCL is amended to permit further elimination
or limitation of the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a
director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest
extent permitted by the DGCL as so amended.

  



  

 _EIGHTH_ : Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State
of Delaware, as the By-Laws may provide. The books of the Corporation may be
kept (subject to any provision contained in the DGCL) outside the State of
Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by
the Board of Directors or in the By-Laws of the Corporation. Any action which
may be taken at a meeting of stockholders, may be taken without a meeting,
without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing,
setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would
be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting.

  



  

 _NINTH_ : The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or
repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all
rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this
reservation.

   | 2.| CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS 
---|---|--- 
  



  

2.1 _CVRs_. The CVRs represent the rights of Holders to receive a
one-time contingent cash payment of the Milestone Payment pursuant to
the Merger Agreement and this Agreement. The initial Holders shall be
determined pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and this Agreement.

  



  

2.2 _Non-transferable_. The CVRs may not be sold, assigned,
transferred, pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or
disposed of, in whole or in part, other than through a Permitted Transfer.
Any such sale, assignment, transfer, pledge, encumbrance or disposal that is
not a Permitted Transfer shall be void _ab initio_ and of no effect.

  



  

2.3 _No Certificate; Registration; Registration of Transfer;
Change of Address_.

  



  

(a) The CVRs shall not be evidenced by a certificate or other
instrument.

  



  

   

4

 



    



  

(b) The Rights Agent shall keep a register (the " _CVR Register_ ")
for the purpose of (i) identifying the Holders of CVRs and (ii) registering
CVRs and Permitted Transfers thereof. The CVR Register will initially
show one position for Cede and Co. representing all of the CVRs that are issued
to the holders of Shares held by DTC on behalf of the street holders of the
Shares. The Rights Agent will have no responsibility whatsoever directly to
the street name holders or DTC participants with respect to transfers of
CVRs. With respect to any payments to be made under _Section 2.4_, the
Rights Agent will accomplish the payment to any former street name holders of
the Shares by sending a lump payment to DTC. The Rights Agent will have no
responsibilities whatsoever with regard to the distribution of payments by
DTC to such street name holders. In the case of CVRs to be received by the
holders of Covered Equity Awards pursuant to the Merger Agreement, such CVRs
shall initially be registered in the name and address of the holder of such
Covered Equity Awards as set forth in the records of the Company at the
Effective Time and in a denomination equal to the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Covered Equity Awards cancelled in connection
with the Merger; _provided_ that, with respect to Out-Of-The-Money Company
Options, such CVRs shall also register the exercise price of such Out-Of-The-
Money Company Options set forth in the records of the Company at the
Effective Time.

  



  

(c) Subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in
_Section 2.2_, every request made to transfer a CVR must be in writing and
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer and other documentation
reasonably requested by the Rights Agent in form reasonably satisfactory to
the Rights Agent pursuant to its guidelines, duly executed by the Holder
thereof, the Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, the Holder's
personal representative or the Holder's survivor, as applicable, and setting
forth in reasonable detail the circumstances relating to the transfer. Upon
receipt of such written notice, the Rights Agent shall, subject to its
reasonable determination that the transfer instrument is in proper form and
the transfer otherwise complies with the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement (including the provisions of _Section 2.2_), register the transfer
of the CVRs in the CVR Register and notify the Parent of the same. No
service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer of a CVR, but
Parent and the Rights Agent may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any stamp or other Tax or charge that is imposed in connection with any such
registration of transfer. The Rights Agent shall have no duty or obligation
to take any action under any section of this Agreement that requires the
payment by a Holder of a CVR of applicable Taxes or charges unless and until
the Rights Agent is reasonably satisfied that all such Taxes or charges have
been paid. All duly transferred CVRs registered in the CVR Register shall be
the valid obligations of Parent and shall entitle the transferee to the same
benefits and rights under this Agreement as those held immediately prior to
the transfer by the transferor. No transfer of a CVR shall be valid unless
and until registered in the CVR Register in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to
change such Holder's address of record in the CVR Register.  The written
request must be duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written
request, the Rights Agent is hereby authorized to, and shall promptly, record
the change of address in the CVR Register.

2.4 _Payment Procedures_.

  



  

(a) In the event that the Milestone is achieved on or prior to
December 31, 2021, then on or prior to the date that is twenty (20) business
days following such achievement of the Milestone, Parent shall deliver to the
Rights Agent (i) a written notice (the " _Milestone Notice_ ") indicating
that the Milestone was achieved and an Officer's Certificate certifying the
date of such achievement and that the Holders are entitled to receive the
Milestone Payment and (ii) cash, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account specified by the Rights Agent, equal to the aggregate
amount necessary to pay the Milestone Payment to all Holders (other than in
respect of Equity Award CVRs) pursuant to _Section 4.2_, along with any
letter of instruction reasonably required by the Rights Agent, and Parent
shall cause all amounts required to be paid in respect of Equity Award CVRs
pursuant to this Agreement (including _Section 4.2_) to be so paid in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the requirements of such
section. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Milestone is not achieved on or
prior to December 31, 2021, then Parent shall have no obligation to pay the
Milestone Payment.

  



  

(b) The Rights Agent shall promptly, and in any event within ten
(10) business days of receipt of the Milestone Notice and cash, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, equal to the aggregate amount
necessary to pay the Milestone Payment to all Holders (other than in respect
of Equity Award CVRs) pursuant to _Section 4.2_ as well as any letter of
instruction reasonably required by the Rights Agent, send each Holder at its
registered address a copy of such Milestone Notice. If the Milestone Payment
is payable to the Holders, then at the time the Rights Agent sends a copy of
the Milestone Notice to the Holders, the Rights Agent shall also pay the
Milestone Payment to each of the Holders in accordance with the corresponding
letter of instruction by check mailed to the address of such Holder reflected
in the CVR Register as of 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the date of the
Milestone Notice. [If any Holder has not returned such completed instruction
letter to the Rights Agent on or before the date that is three (3) months
immediately following the date of the Milestone Notice, then the Rights Agent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resend such Milestone Notice and
instruction letter on or before the date that is six (6) months after the
date of the applicable Milestone Notice.]

  



  

(c) If the Milestone is not achieved on or prior to December 31,
2021, then on or prior to the date that is twenty (20) business days
following December 31, 2021, Parent shall deliver to the Rights Agent a
written notice (the " _Milestone Failure Notice_ ") indicating that the
Milestone was not achieved and an Officer's Certificate certifying the same.
The Rights Agent shall promptly, and in any event within ten (10) business
days of receipt of the Milestone Failure Notice, send each Holder at its
registered address a copy of such Milestone Failure Notice.

  



  

(d) Each of Parent and its Affiliates and the Rights Agent shall be
entitled to deduct or withhold, or cause to be deducted or withheld, from any
payments made pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code, the U.S. Treasury Regulations
thereunder, or any other applicable Tax law, as may be reasonably determined
by Parent, its Affiliate or the Rights Agent, as applicable. With respect to
Equity Award CVRs, any such withholding may be made, or caused to be made, by
Parent through the Surviving Corporation's or an Affiliate's payroll system or
any successor payroll system. Prior to making any Tax withholdings or causing
any Tax withholdings to be made with respect to any Holder (other than
payroll withholding and reporting with respect to amounts received in respect
of Equity Award CVRs), the Rights Agent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit from such Holder an IRS Form W-9 or other applicable Tax
form in order to provide a reasonable opportunity for the Holder to provide
such Tax forms to avoid or reduce such withholding amounts, and a Milestone
Payment may be reasonably delayed in order to gather such necessary Tax forms.
The Rights Agent shall promptly and timely remit, or cause to be remitted,
any amounts it withholds in respect of Taxes to the appropriate Governmental
Body. To the extent any amounts are deducted or withheld and properly and
timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement and the Merger Agreement as
having been paid to the Holder to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid, and, to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirement, Parent
shall deliver (or shall cause the Rights Agent to deliver) to the Holder to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid an Internal Revenue Service
Form 1099, an Internal Revenue Service Form W-2 or other reasonably
acceptable evidence of such withholding.

  



  

   

6

 



    



  

(e) If any funds delivered to the Rights Agent for payment to
Holders as Milestone Payments remain undistributed to the Holders on the date
that is six (6) months after the date of the Milestone Notice, Parent shall be
entitled to require the Rights Agent to deliver to Parent or its designee any
funds which had been made available to the Rights Agent in connection with
such Milestone Payment and not disbursed to the Holders (including, all
interest and other income received by the Rights Agent in respect of
all funds made available to it), and, thereafter, such Holders shall be
entitled to payment from Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
other similar Legal Requirements and _Section 2.4(f)_) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the Milestone Payments that may be payable.

  



  

(f) Neither Parent, the Rights Agent nor any of their Affiliates
shall be liable to any Holder for any Milestone Payments delivered to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Legal Requirements. If, despite Parent's and/or the Rights Agent's
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver any Milestone Payment to the
applicable Holder, such Milestone Payment has not been paid prior to two (2)
years after delivery of the Milestone Notice (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which such Milestone Payment would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Body), such Milestone Payment will,
to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property
of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously
entitled thereto. In addition to and not in limitation of any other indemnity
obligation herein, Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Rights
Agent with respect to any liability, penalty, cost or expense the
Rights Agent may incur or be subject to in connection with transferring such
property to Parent, unless such liability, penalty, cost or expense has been
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be a result of Rights
Agent's gross negligence, bad faith or willful or intentional misconduct.

  



  

(g) Except to the extent any portion of any Milestone Payment is
required to be treated as imputed interest pursuant to applicable
Legal Requirement, the parties hereto intend to treat (i) the CVRs received
with respect to the Shares, other than the Equity Award CVRs, pursuant to the
Merger Agreement for all U.S. federal and applicable state and local income
Tax purposes as additional consideration paid at the Effective Time for such
Shares pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (ii) any Milestone Payments received
in respect of such CVRs as amounts realized on the disposition of the
applicable CVRs and (iii) Milestone Payments paid in respect of each Equity
Award CVR, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, for all U.S. federal and
applicable state and local income Tax purposes, as wages in the year in which
the Milestone Payment is made (and not upon the receipt of such CVR).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this _Section 2.4(g)_,
an Equity Award CVR shall not include a CVR in respect of a Restricted Share
for which a valid and timely election under Section 83(b) of the Code has
been made.

  



  

   

7

 



    



  

2.5 _No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership
Interest_.

  



  

(a) The CVRs shall not have any voting or dividend rights, and
interest shall not accrue on any amounts payable on the CVRs to any Holder.

  



  

(b) The CVRs shall not represent any equity or ownership interest
in Parent or in any constituent company to the Merger or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

  



  

2.6 _Ability to Abandon CVR_. A Holder may at any time, at such
Holder's option, abandon all of such Holder's remaining rights in a CVR by
transferring such CVR to Parent or any of its Affiliates without consideration
therefor. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or any of its
Affiliates from offering to acquire or acquiring any CVRs for consideration
from the Holders, in private transactions or otherwise, in its sole
discretion. Any CVRs acquired by Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be
automatically deemed extinguished and no longer outstanding for purposes of
the definition of Acting Holders.

  



   | 3.| THE RIGHTS AGENT 
---|---|--- 
  



  

3.1 _Certain Duties and Responsibilities_. The Rights Agent shall

negligence, bad faith or willful or intentional misconduct.

  



  

3.2 _Certain Rights of the Rights Agent_. The Rights Agent
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically
set forth in this Agreement, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be
read into this Agreement against the Rights Agent.  In addition:

  



  

(a) the Rights Agent may rely and shall be protected and held
harmless by Parent in acting or refraining from acting upon any
resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
request, direction, consent, order or other paper or document believed by it
in good faith to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper
party or parties;

  



  

(b) whenever the Rights Agent shall deem it desirable that a matter
be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any
action hereunder, the Rights Agent may rely upon an Officer's Certificate,
which certificate shall be full authorization and protection to the Rights
Agent, and the Rights Agent shall, in the absence of fraud, gross negligence,
bad faith or willful or intentional misconduct on its part, incur no
liability and be held harmless by Parent for or in respect of any action
taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it under the provisions of this
Agreement in reliance upon such certificate;

  



  

   

8

 



    



  

(c) the Rights Agent may engage and consult with counsel of its
selection and the written advice of such counsel or any opinion of
counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection and shall be
held harmless by Parent in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted
by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;

  



  

(d) the permissive rights of the Rights Agent to do things
enumerated in this Agreement shall not be construed as a duty;

  



  

(e) the Rights Agent shall not be required to give any note or
surety in respect of the execution of such powers or otherwise in respect of
the premises;

  



  

(f) the Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of, and
shall be held harmless by Parent with respect to any of the statements of
fact or recitals contained in this Agreement or be required to verify the
same, but all such statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have
been made by Parent only;

  



  

(g) the Rights Agent shall have no liability and shall be held
harmless by Parent in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the
execution and delivery hereof (except the due execution and delivery hereof
by the Rights Agent and the enforceability of this Agreement against the
Rights Agent assuming the due execution and delivery hereof by Parent); nor
shall it be responsible for any breach by Parent of any covenant or condition
contained in this Agreement;

  



  

(h) Parent agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and hold the
Rights Agent harmless against, any loss, liability, claim, demands, suits or
expense arising out of or in connection with Rights Agent's duties under this
Agreement, including the reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of
defending Rights Agent against any claims, charges, demands, suits or loss,
unless such loss has been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
be a result of Rights Agent's gross negligence, bad faith or willful or
intentional misconduct;

  



  

(i) Parent agrees (i) to pay the fees and expenses of the Rights
Agent in connection with this Agreement as agreed upon in writing by the
Rights Agent and Parent on or prior to the date hereof (which shall not exceed

governmental charges, reasonable documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the Rights Agent in the execution of this Agreement (other than Taxes imposed
on or measured by the Rights Agent's net income and franchise or similar
Taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net income Taxes)). The Rights Agent shall
also be entitled to reimbursement from Parent for all reasonable and
necessary out-of-pocket expenses paid or incurred by it in connection with the
administration by the Rights Agent of its duties hereunder; and

  



  

(j) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent
to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in
the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of its
rights if there shall be reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of
such funds or adequate indemnification against such risk or liability is not
reasonably assured to it.

3.3 _Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor_.

  



  

(a) The Rights Agent may resign at any time by giving written
notice thereof to Parent specifying a date when such resignation shall
take effect, which notice shall be sent at least sixty (60) days prior to the
date so specified but in no event shall such resignation become effective
until a successor Rights Agent has been appointed and accepted such
appointment in accordance with _Section 3.4_. Parent has the right to remove
the Rights Agent at any time by specifying a date when such removal shall take
effect but no such removal shall become effective until a successor Rights
Agent has been appointed and accepted such appointment in accordance with 
_Section 3.4_. Notice of such removal shall be given by Parent to the Rights
Agent, which notice shall be sent at least sixty (60) days prior to the date
so specified.

  



  

(b) If the Rights Agent provides notice of its intent to resign, is
removed or becomes incapable of acting, Parent shall, as soon as
is reasonably practicable, appoint a qualified successor Rights Agent who
shall be a stock transfer agent of national reputation or the corporate trust
department of a commercial bank. The successor Rights Agent so appointed
shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with
_Section 3.4_, become the successor Rights Agent.

  



  

(c) Parent shall give notice of each resignation and each removal
of a Rights Agent and each appointment of a successor Rights Agent by
mailing written notice of such event by first-class mail to the Holders as
their names and addresses appear in the CVR Register.  Each notice shall
include the name and address of the successor Rights Agent. If Parent fails
to send such notice within ten (10) business days after acceptance of
appointment by a successor Rights Agent, the successor Rights Agent shall
cause the notice to be mailed at the expense of Parent. Failure to give any
notice provided for in this _Section 3.3_, however, shall not affect the
legality or validity of the resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the
appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.

  



  

3.4 _Acceptance of Appointment by Successor_. Every successor
Rights Agent appointed hereunder shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to
Parent and to the retiring Rights Agent an instrument accepting such
appointment and a counterpart of this Agreement, and thereupon such successor
Rights Agent, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested
with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Rights Agent.
On request of Parent or the successor Rights Agent, the retiring Rights Agent
shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to the successor Rights
Agent all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Rights Agent.

  



   | 4.| COVENANTS 
---|---|--- 
  



  

4.1 _List of Holders_. Parent shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to the Rights Agent, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Rights Agent, the names and addresses of the Holders as received from
Parent's Depository Agent in the Offer and Parent's Paying Agent in the
Merger, promptly upon the Offer Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, as
applicable.

  



  

   

10

 



    



     

4.2 _Payment of Milestone Payments_. If the Milestone has been
achieved in accordance with this Agreement, Parent shall, (i) other
than payments in respect of Equity Award CVRs, deposit with the Rights Agent,
for payment to the Holders in accordance with _Section 2.4_, the aggregate
amount necessary to pay the Milestone Payment to all Holders, and (ii) in
respect of Equity Award CVRs, cause to be paid to the applicable Holders the
aggregate amount necessary to pay the Milestone Payment to the applicable
Holders through the Surviving Corporation's or its Affiliate's payroll system
or any successor payroll system. The payments described in _clause (ii)_ of
the preceding sentence shall be paid as soon as practicable following
achievement of the Milestone in accordance with this Agreement (subject to
withholding as described in Section 2.8 of the Merger Agreement), and
shall not be delayed in a manner which results in a tax or penalty to the
holder of an Equity Award CVR under Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

4.3 _Diligent Efforts_. Commencing upon the Closing, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Parent Group and other Selling Entities (as
applicable), taken together, to, as promptly as practicable and throughout
the period between Closing and December 31, 2021, use Diligent Efforts to
achieve the Milestone; _provided_ , that use of Diligent Efforts does not
guarantee that Parent will achieve the Milestone at all or by a specific
date. For clarity, Diligent Efforts does not mean that either of Parent or the
Parent Group guarantees the Milestone will be achieved or that the Milestone
will be achieved by a specific date, and the fact that the Milestone is not
actually achieved is not, in and of itself, dispositive evidence that Parent
or the Parent Group did not in fact comply with its or their obligations
under this Agreement in attempting to achieve the Milestone.

  



  

4.4 _Books and Records_. Until the earlier of (i) such time as the
Milestone has been achieved and (ii) December 31, 2021, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Parent Group and other Selling Entities (as applicable) to,
keep records in the ordinary course of business pursuant to record-keeping
procedures normally used by the Parent Group with respect to its other
products, regarding its activities with respect to achievement of the
Milestone. From the date hereof until the earlier of (A) such time as
the Milestone has been achieved and (B) December 31, 2021, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Parent Group and other Selling Entities (as applicable) to,
maintain such records for a minimum period of one (1) year following such date
(or, if longer, the maximum retention period under the record retention
policy of Parent for such records or such period required by applicable Legal
Requirements).

  



  

4.5 _Sufficiency of Assets_. Until the earlier of (i) such time as
Parent has paid the aggregate amount necessary to pay the Milestone
Payment to all Holders in accordance with _Section 4.2_ or (ii) such time as
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 7.8_, Parent shall
(A) maintain its existence and (B) maintain sufficient assets or bona
fide contractual arrangements entitling it to sufficient assets, to enable
Parent to satisfy in full payment of the aggregate Milestone Payment payable
to all Holders.

(a) Subject to _Section 5.1_ (which amendments pursuant to
_Section 5.1_ may be made without the consent of any Holder or the Rights

any amendment pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 5.2_, Parent shall
mail (or cause the Rights Agent to mail) a notice thereof by first class mail

forth such amendment.

  



  

5.3 _Execution of Amendments_. Prior to executing any amendment
permitted by this _Section 5_, the Rights Agent shall be entitled to
receive, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an opinion of counsel
selected by Parent stating that the execution of such amendment is authorized
or permitted by this Agreement. The Rights Agent may, but is not obligated
to, enter into any such amendment that affects the Rights Agent's own rights,
powers, trusts or duties under this Agreement or otherwise.

  



  

5.4 _Effect of Amendments_. Upon the execution of any amendment
under this _Section 5_, this Agreement shall be modified in
accordance therewith, such amendment shall form a part of this Agreement for
all purposes and every Holder shall be bound thereby.

6.1 _Event of Default_. " _Event of Default_ " with respect to the
CVRs, means any one of the following events, which shall have occurred and be
continuing (whatever the reason for such Event of Default and whether it shall
be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of Legal Requirement
or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule
or regulation of any Governmental Body):

  



  

(a) default in the payment by Parent pursuant to the terms of this

(10) business days after the Milestone Payment shall become due and payable;
or

  



  

(b) material default in the performance, or breach in any material
respect, of any covenant or warranty of Parent hereunder (other than a
default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere in this _Section
6.1_ specifically dealt with), and continuance of such default or breach for
a period of ninety (90) days after a written notice specifying such default or
breach and requiring it to be remedied is given, which written notice states
that it is a "Notice of Default" hereunder and is sent by registered or
certified mail to Parent by the Rights Agent or to Parent and the Rights Agent
by the Holders of at least 35% of the outstanding CVRs.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

If an Event of Default described above occurs and is continuing (and has not
been cured or waived), then, and in each and every such case, (i) the Rights
Agent by notice in writing to Parent or (ii) the Rights Agent upon the written
request of the Holders of at least 35% of the outstanding CVRs by notice in
writing to Parent (and to the Rights Agent if given by the Acting Holders),
shall commence an arbitration proceeding to protect the rights of the Holders,
including to obtain payment for any amounts then due and payable.

  



  

The foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.1_, however, are subject to the
condition that if, at any time after the Rights Agent shall have
commenced such arbitration proceeding, and before any award shall have been
obtained, Parent shall pay or shall deposit with the Rights Agent a sum
sufficient to pay all amounts which shall have become due and such amount as
shall be sufficient to cover reasonable compensation to the Rights Agent, its
agents, attorneys and counsel, and all Events of Default under this Agreement
shall have been cured, waived or otherwise remedied as provided herein, then
and in every such case the Acting Holders, by written notice to Parent and to
the Rights Agent, may waive all defaults that are the subject of such
arbitration proceeding, but no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall
extend to or shall affect any subsequent default.

  



  

6.2 _Arbitration Proceedings for Enforcement_. If an Event of
Default has occurred, has not been waived and is continuing, the Rights Agent
may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it
by this Agreement by commencing arbitration proceedings pursuant to _Section
7.6_.

  



  

6.3 _Limitations on Suits by Holders_. Subject to the last
sentence of this _Section 6.3_, no Holder of any CVR shall have any
right under this Agreement to commence arbitration proceedings under or with
respect to this Agreement, or for the appointment of a Rights Agent,
receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official, for any other
remedy hereunder, unless (i) such Holder previously shall have given to the
Rights Agent written notice of default, (ii) the Holders of at least 35% of
the outstanding CVRs shall have made written request upon the Rights Agent to
commence such arbitration proceeding in its own name as Rights Agent
hereunder and shall have offered to the Rights Agent such reasonable
indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be
incurred therein or thereby and (iii) the Rights Agent for fifteen (15) days
after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity shall have
failed to commence any such arbitration proceeding and no direction
inconsistent with such written request shall have been given to the Rights
Agent pursuant to _Section 6.4_. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement, the right of any Holder of any CVR to receive payment of the
amounts that a Milestone Notice indicates are payable in respect of such CVR
on or after the applicable due date, or to commence arbitration proceedings
for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such due date, shall not
be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.

  



  

6.4 _Control by Acting Holders._ Subject to the last sentence of
this _Section 6.4_, the Acting Holders shall have the right to direct the
time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available
to the Rights Agent, or exercising any power conferred on the Rights Agent by
this Agreement; _provided_ that such direction shall not be otherwise than in
accordance with Legal Requirement and the provisions of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_  that (subject to the provisions of _Section 3.1_)
the Rights Agent shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction
if the Rights Agent, being advised by counsel, shall determine that the action
or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken or if the Rights Agent
(acting in good faith through its board of directors, the executive
committee, or a committee of directors of the Rights Agent) shall determine
that the action or proceedings so directed would involve the Rights Agent in
personal liability or if the Rights Agent in good faith shall so determine
that the actions or forbearances specified in or pursuant to such direction
would be unduly prejudicial to the interests of Holders not joining in the
giving of said direction. Nothing in this Agreement shall impair the right
of the Rights Agent in its discretion to take any action deemed proper by the
Rights Agent and which is not inconsistent with such direction or directions
by the Acting Holders.

   | 7.| OTHER PROVISIONS OF GENERAL APPLICATION 
---|---|--- 
  



  

7.1 _Notices to the Rights Agent and Parent_. Any notice or other
communication required or permitted to be delivered to Parent or the Rights
Agent under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed properly
delivered, given and received (a) upon receipt when delivered by hand, (b)
two (2) business days after being sent by registered mail or by courier or
express delivery service, (c) if sent by email transmission prior to 6:00
p.m. recipient's local time, upon transmission when receipt is confirmed or
(d) if sent by email transmission after 6:00 p.m. recipient's local time and
receipt is confirmed, the business day following the date of transmission;
_provided_ that in each case the notice or other communication is sent to the
physical address or email address, as applicable, set forth beneath the name
of such party below (or to such other physical address or email address as
such party shall have specified in a written notice given to the other party):

  



  

If to the Rights Agent, to it at:

  



  

[●]

  



  

with a copy (which shall not constitute notice) to:

  



  

[●]

  



  

If to Parent, to it at:

with a copy (which shall not constitute notice) to:

The Rights Agent or Parent may specify a different address, facsimile number
or email address by giving notice in accordance with this _Section 7.1_.

  



  

   

15

 



    



  

7.2 _Notice to Holders_. Where this Agreement provides for notice
to Holders, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein
expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to
each Holder affected by such event, at the Holder's address as it appears in
the CVR Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the
earliest date, if any, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case
where notice to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such
notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall
affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.

  



  

7.3 _Parent Successors and Assigns_. Parent may assign any or all
of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder in its sole discretion and
without the consent of any other Person (i) to one or more of its Affiliates
or (ii) to any purchaser, licensee or sublicensee of substantial rights to
the E-Product that is a company in the pharmaceutical industry (each, an "
_Assignee_ ");  _provided_ that the Assignee agrees to assume and be bound by
all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any such Assignee may
thereafter assign, in the same manner as Parent pursuant to the prior
sentence, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to
one or more additional Assignees which agree to assume and be bound by all of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
connection with any assignment to an Assignee, Parent shall agree to remain
liable for the performance by each Assignee of obligations of Parent
hereunder, with such Assignee substituted for Parent under this Agreement.
This Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by Parent's successors and each Assignee. This Agreement shall
not restrict Parent's, any Assignee's or any of their respective
successors' ability to merge or consolidate with, or sell, issue, license or
dispose of its stock or other equity interests or assets to, any other
Person, or spin-off or split-off. Each of Parent's successors and each
Assignee shall, by a supplemental contingent consideration payment agreement
or other acknowledgement executed and delivered to the Rights Agent, expressly
assume payment of amounts on all of the CVRs and the performance of every
obligation, agreement and covenant of this Agreement on the part of Parent to
be performed or observed. The Rights Agent may not assign this Agreement
without Parent's written consent.  Any attempted assignment of this Agreement
or any such rights in violation of this _Section 7.3_ shall be void and
of no effect.

  



  

7.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, shall give to any Person (other than the Rights
Agent, Parent, Parent's successors and Assignees, the Holders and the
Holders' successors and assigns pursuant to a Permitted Transfer, each of
whom is intended to be, and is, a third party beneficiary hereunder) any
benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement
or under any covenant or provision herein contained, all such covenants and
provisions being for the sole benefit of the Rights Agent, Parent, Parent's
successors and Assignees, and the Holders. The Holders of CVRs shall have no
rights except the contractual rights as are expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, any Holder or Holder's successor or assign pursuant to a
Permitted Transfer may at any time agree to renounce, in whole or in part,
whether or not for consideration, such Holder's rights under this Agreement
by written notice to the Rights Agent and Parent, which notice, if given,
shall be irrevocable, and Parent may, in its sole discretion, at any time
offer consideration to Holders in exchange for their agreement to irrevocably
renounce their rights, in whole or in part, hereunder.

7.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the CVRs and all actions
arising under or in connection herewith and therewith (whether based
in contract, tort, or otherwise) shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

  



  

7.6 _Arbitration_.  Any dispute, controversy or claim (including
any claim for breach hereof) based upon, relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby (other than a dispute,
controversy or claim asserted against or by the Rights Agent to the extent
pertaining to the Rights Agent's rights, immunities, liabilities, duties,
responsibilities or obligations hereunder) shall be resolved by binding
arbitration conducted in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration (" _Rules_
") of the International Chamber of Commerce (the " _ICC_ "). The arbitration
shall be conducted by a panel of three arbitrators, each of whom shall be
independent and a lawyer or retired judge with at least fifteen years'
experience in the pharmaceutical industry and with mergers and acquisitions.
No later than fifteen (15) days after an arbitration proceeding is commenced
under this _Section 7.6_, Parent shall nominate one arbitrator and the Holder
(or, if more than one Holder is a party to the arbitration proceeding, all
such Holders collectively) shall nominate one arbitrator, and the two so
nominated arbitrators shall select the third arbitrator. If the two
arbitrators cannot or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator within fifteen
(15) days of their confirmation by the ICC, the third arbitrator shall be
appointed by the ICC in accordance with the Rules.  The arbitration shall be
administered by the ICC acting through its International Court of Arbitration.
The arbitration shall be conducted in the English language and the seat, or
place, of the arbitration shall be the city of New York, New York.
Hearings shall be conducted in New York, New York, or at such other location
as mutually agreed by Parent and the Holder or Holders that are party to the
arbitration proceeding. The arbitration award shall be final, conclusive,
binding and non-appealable and shall not be subject to further review by any
court. The arbitrator shall have no power to amend or supplement the
terms of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or act _ex aequo et bono_.
Judgment upon the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof. Each party shall bear his, her or its own costs of any such
arbitration or investigation in respect of any dispute. Any award payable in
favor of the Holders or the Rights Agent as a result of arbitration shall
be distributed to the Holders on a pro rata basis, based on the number of
CVRs held by each Holder.

  



  

7.7 _Severability_.  Any term or provision of this Agreement that
is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
of this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or
provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto
agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit
such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace
such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable
and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and
enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace
such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable
term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term
or provision.

7.8 _Termination_.  This Agreement shall be terminated and of no
force or effect, the parties hereto shall have no liability hereunder (other
than with respect to monies due and owing by Parent to Rights Agent), and no
payments shall be required to be made, upon the earlier to occur of (a) the
date that is six (6) months after the date of the Milestone Notice, (b) the
date that is ten (10) business days after the date of the Milestone Failure
Notice, and (c) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with
its terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such termination shall affect
any rights or obligations accrued prior to the effective date of such
termination or _Sections 4.4_ , _6.1_ , _6.2_ , _6.3_ , _6.4_ , _7.4_ , 
_7.5_ , _7.6_ , _7.7_ , _7.9_ or this _Section 7.8_, which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, or the resignation, replacement or removal of
the Rights Agent.

  



  

7.9 _Entire Agreement; Counterparts_. This Agreement, the Merger
Agreement (including its Exhibits, Annexes and the Company
Disclosure Schedule) and the Support Agreements constitute the entire
agreement and supersede all contemporaneous and prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among or between any of the
parties hereto, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. The
exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by PDF
shall be sufficient to bind the parties hereto to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.
