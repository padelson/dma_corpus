Claim</U>. As a condition precedent to an Indemnitee&rsquo;s right to be indemnified, such Indemnitee must notify the Corporation
in writing as soon as practicable of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation involving such Indemnitee for which indemnity
will or could be sought. With respect to any action, suit, proceeding or investigation of which the Corporation is so notified,
the Corporation will be entitled to participate therein at its own expense and/or to assume the defense thereof at its own expense,
with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnitee. After notice from the Corporation to Indemnitee of its election so to assume
such defense, the Corporation shall not be liable to Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by Indemnitee
in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, other than as provided below in this Section&nbsp;(4). Indemnitee
shall have the right to employ his or her own counsel in connection with such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel incurred after notice from the Corporation of its assumption of the defense thereof shall be
at the expense of Indemnitee unless (i)&nbsp;the employment of counsel by Indemnitee has been authorized by the Corporation, (ii)&nbsp;counsel
to Indemnitee shall have reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict of interest or position on any significant issue between
the Corporation and Indemnitee in the conduct of the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation or (iii)&nbsp;the
Corporation shall not in fact have employed counsel to assume the defense of such action, suit, proceeding or investigation, in
each of which cases the fees and expenses of counsel for Indemnitee shall be at the expense of the Corporation, except as otherwise
expressly provided by this Article&nbsp;SIXTH. The Corporation shall not be entitled, without the consent of Indemnitee, to assume
the defense of any claim brought by or in the right of the Corporation or as to which counsel for Indemnitee shall have reasonably
made the conclusion provided for in clause (ii)&nbsp;above. The Corporation shall not be required to indemnify Indemnitee under
this Article&nbsp;SIXTH for any amounts paid in settlement of any action, suit, proceeding or investigation effected without its
written consent. The Corporation shall not settle any action, suit, proceeding or investigation in any manner that would impose
any penalty or limitation on Indemnitee without Indemnitee&rsquo;s written consent. Neither the Corporation nor Indemnitee will
unreasonably withhold or delay its consent to any proposed settlement.</P>

any expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees) incurred by or on behalf of Indemnitee in defending an action, suit,

Indemnitee to repay all amounts so advanced in the event that it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision
from which there is no further right to appeal that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as
authorized in this Article&nbsp;SIXTH; and <I>provided</I>, <I>further</I>, that no such advancement of expenses shall be

the Corporation, or (ii)&nbsp;with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,&nbsp;Indemnitee had reasonable cause to

and Advancement of Expenses</U>. In order to obtain indemnification or advancement of expenses pursuant to Section&nbsp;(1), (2),
(3)&nbsp;or (5)&nbsp;of this Article&nbsp;SIXTH, an Indemnitee shall submit to the Corporation a written request. Any such advancement
of expenses shall be made promptly, and in any event within 60 days after receipt by the Corporation of the written request of
Indemnitee, unless (i)&nbsp;the Corporation has assumed the defense pursuant to Section&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;of this Article&nbsp;SIXTH
(and none of the circumstances described in Section&nbsp;(4)&nbsp;of this Article&nbsp;SIXTH that would nonetheless entitle the
Indemnitee to indemnification for the fees and expenses of separate counsel have occurred) or (ii)&nbsp;the Corporation determines
within such 60-day period that Indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section&nbsp;(1), (2)&nbsp;or
(5)&nbsp;of this Article&nbsp;SIXTH, as the case may be. Any such indemnification, unless ordered by a court, shall be made with
respect to requests under Section&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;or (2)&nbsp;only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination by the
Corporation that the indemnification of Indemnitee is proper because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in Section&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;or (2), as the case may be. Such determination shall be made in each instance (a)&nbsp;by a majority
vote of the directors of the Corporation consisting of persons who are not at that time parties to the action, suit or proceeding
in question (the &ldquo;disinterested directors&rdquo;), whether or not a quorum, (b)&nbsp;by a committee of disinterested directors
designated by majority vote of disinterested directors, whether or not a quorum, (c)&nbsp;if there are no disinterested directors,
or if the disinterested directors so direct, by independent legal counsel (who may, to the extent permitted by law, be regular
legal counsel to the Corporation) in a written opinion, or (d)&nbsp;by the stockholders of the Corporation.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">(7)&nbsp;<U>Remedies</U>. The right to
indemnification or advancement of expenses as granted by this Article&nbsp;SIXTH shall be enforceable by Indemnitee in any
court of competent jurisdiction. Neither the failure of the Corporation to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such action that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable
standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Corporation pursuant to Section&nbsp;(6)&nbsp;of this
Article&nbsp;SIXTH that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct. In any suit brought by Indemnitee to
enforce a right to indemnification, or brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms
of an undertaking, the Corporation shall have the burden of proving that Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to
such advancement of expenses, under this Article&nbsp;SIXTH. Indemnitee&rsquo;s expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees)
reasonably incurred in connection with successfully establishing Indemnitee&rsquo;s right to indemnification, in whole or in
part, in any such proceeding shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any suit brought
by Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder it shall be a defense that the Indemnitee has not met any
applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL.</P>

set forth in this Article&nbsp;SIXTH.</P>

Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the
offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making
such determination shall have the power to limit such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so modified. In the event
such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision.</FONT></P>
