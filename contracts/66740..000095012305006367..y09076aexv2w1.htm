RECITALS    

 WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have each determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (as defined below), are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, their respective stockholders;   

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously adopted resolutions approving the acquisition of the Company by Parent, the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and recommending that the Companys stockholders adopt the agreement of merger (as such term is used in Section 251 of the Delaware General Corporation law (the " _Corporation Law_ ")) contained in this Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated hereby;   

 WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this Agreement;   

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:   

ARTICLE I    

THE MERGER    

 SECTION 1.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Corporation Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") as soon as practicable, but in any event within two Business Days (as defined below), following the satisfaction or waiver, if permissible, of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing (as defined below) but subject to the satisfaction or waiver, if permissible, thereof). The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") under the name "CUNO Incorporated" and shall continue its existence under the Laws (as defined below) of the State of Delaware. In connection with the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease.   

 SECTION 1.02. _Consummation of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a duly executed certificate of merger, as required by the Corporation Law, and the parties shall take all such further actions as may be required by Law to make the Merger effective. Prior to the filing referred to in this _Section 1.02_,    ##### 

  

    

a closing (the " _Closing_ ") will be held at the offices of Cleary Gottlieb
Steen and Hamilton LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York (or such other
place as the parties may agree) for the purpose of confirming all the matters
contained herein. The time the Merger becomes effective in accordance with
applicable Law is referred to as the " _Effective Time_."    

 SECTION 1.03. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the Corporation Law.   

 SECTION 1.04. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety to read as the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (which shall comply with _Section 5.06(a)_ hereof), except that Article I thereof shall read as follows: "The name of the Corporation is CUNO Incorporated" and, as so amended, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as permitted by Law and this Agreement. The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (which shall comply with _Section 5.06(a)_ hereof), shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   

 SECTION 1.05. _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until their respective death, permanent disability, resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.   

 SECTION 1.06. _Conversion of Shares_. Each share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (each, a " _Share_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary (as defined below) of Parent or the Company or held in the treasury of the Company, all of which shall be canceled without any consideration being exchanged therefor, and other than Dissenting Shares (as defined below)) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive in cash an amount per Share (subject to any applicable withholding Tax specified in _Section 1.08_) equal to $72.00, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon the surrender of the certificate representing such Shares as provided in _Section 2.02(b)_ or as otherwise provided in _Section 2.02(c)_. At the Effective Time all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein.   

 SECTION 1.07. _Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   

 SECTION 1.08. _Withholding Taxes_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Merger such amounts as are required to be withheld under the Internal    ##### 

  

    

Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld and duly paid to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.    

 SECTION 1.09. _Subsequent Actions_. If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to continue, vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise the Surviving Corporations right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties, privileges, franchises or assets of the Company as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger, or otherwise to carry out the intent of this Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties, privileges, franchises or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the intent of this Agreement.   

ARTICLE II    

DISSENTING SHARES; PAYMENT FOR SHARES; OPTIONS    

 SECTION 2.01. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders properly exercising appraisal rights available under Section 262 of the Corporation Law (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under the Corporation Law. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the Corporation Law. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal, such holders Shares shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub (a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the Corporation Law and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of the Corporation Law and (b) the opportunity to participate in, and after the Closing, direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the Corporation Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of capital stock of the Company, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.   

 SECTION 2.02. _Payment for Shares_. (a) From time to time after the Effective Time, Parent will make available to a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably approved prior to the Closing by the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") sufficient funds    ##### 

  

 

to make the payments due pursuant to _Section 1.06_ on a timely basis to
holders of Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (such amounts being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment
Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make
the payments provided for in the preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund.
The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided
in this Agreement.    

 (b) As soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event within five Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Company, Shares held in the treasury of the Company and Dissenting Shares), a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and receiving payment therefor. Following surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid in exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax as specified in _Section 1.08_) equal to the product of the number of Shares represented by such Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates. If payment is to be made to a Person (as defined below) other than the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. From and after the Effective Time and until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.02_, each Certificate shall represent for all purposes solely the right to receive, in accordance with the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration in cash multiplied by the number of Shares evidenced by such Certificate, without any interest thereon.   

 (c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented thereby.   

 (d) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company for nine months after the Effective Time shall be repaid to the Surviving Corporation. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not complied with this _Section 2.02_ prior to the end of such nine-month period shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) but only as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Neither Parent nor the    ##### 

  

 

Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any monies
delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to the date
that such unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law, any unclaimed funds payable with respect to
such Certificates shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation.    

 SECTION 2.03. _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Shares shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consolidation as provided in this Article II, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.   

 SECTION 2.04. _Existing Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights; Existing Restricted Shares and Performance Shares_.

 (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted Shares (collectively, the " _Existing Restricted Shares_ ") or performance shares (collectively, the " _Existing Performance Shares_ ") shall become fully vested and shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in any event within two Business Days following the Effective Time), an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of Existing Restricted Shares or Existing Performance Shares multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, less applicable withholding Taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to such payment.   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary or appropriate action to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 2.04_.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of any of the restrictions set forth in this  _Section 5.02_ by any officer, director, employee, investment banker, attorney, agent, representative or Affiliate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.02_ by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the prior execution by such Person or group of a confidentiality agreement substantially in the form of, and with confidentiality terms at least as restrictive as, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company may furnish, at any time prior to the adoption of the Agreement by the requisite vote of the holders of Shares, information to or enter into discussions or negotiations with any Person or group that has made an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal if (i) the Company has complied in all material respects with this _Section 5.02_ with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) only to the extent that (A) the Board of Directors of the Company determines that such unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal, (B) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after receiving advice of outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be considered to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law and (C) the Company has provided Parent prior written notice of its intent to take any such action at least one Business Day prior to taking such action.   

 (b) The Company will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent, orally and in writing, if any such information is requested or any such negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated and will promptly communicate to Parent the identity of the Person or group making such request or inquiry (the " _Potential Acquiror_ ") and any other material terms of such request, inquiry or Acquisition Proposal. If the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents or Affiliates on its behalf) participates in discussions or negotiation with, or provides information to, a Potential    ##### 

  

    

Acquiror, the Company will keep Parent advised on a reasonably current basis

Without limiting any other rights of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement in respect of any such action, any withdrawal or modification by the Company of the approval or recommendation of the Merger or any termination of this Agreement shall not have any effect on the approvals of, and other actions referred to herein for the purpose of causing Takeover Laws and the Confidentiality Agreement to be inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, which approvals and actions are irrevocable.   

 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (subject to Parents rights in _Section 7.01(f)_).

reasonably likely to be consummated without unreasonable delay.   

 SECTION 5.03. _Access to Information_. (a) From and after the date of this Agreement, subject to applicable requirements of Law, the Company will (i) give Parent and Merger Sub and their authorized accountants, investment bankers, counsel and other representatives reasonable access (during regular business hours upon reasonable notice) to all employees, plants, offices, warehouses and other facilities and to all books, contracts (subject to applicable confidentiality restrictions), commitments and records (including Tax returns) of the Company and its Subsidiaries and instruct the Companys and its Subsidiaries independent public accountants to provide access to their work papers and such other information as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request, (ii) permit Parent and Merger Sub to make such inspections as they may reasonably require, (iii) cause its officers and those of its Subsidiaries to furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such financial and operating data and other information with respect to the business, properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or Merger Sub may from time to time reasonably request and (iv) furnish promptly to Parent and Merger Sub a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during such period pursuant to the requirements of the federal or state securities Laws.

As long as this Agreement is in effect, the Company shall comply with this _Section 5.04_ even if its Board of Directors shall have withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation of the Merger.    #####

Parent agrees that in the event of any action by the Surviving Corporation or by Parent with respect to the Surviving Corporation that causes the Surviving Corporations creditworthiness to be materially adversely affected, Parent shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation fulfills its indemnification obligations referred to in the preceding sentence.

 (c) This _Section 5.06_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, any Person or entity referred to in this _Section 5.06_ (whether or not parties to this Agreement).

collective bargaining agreement) (the " _Company Employees_ ") compensation
and employee benefits that are substantially equivalent in the aggregate to
those provided to the Company Employees in the aggregate immediately before
the Effective Time.   

 (c) To the extent Parent determines to make Company Employees eligible to participate in particular compensation and benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause service rendered by Company Employees prior to the Effective Time to be credited for all purposes under compensation and employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plans or retiree welfare benefits, including retiree medical benefit plans, or as would result in a duplication of benefits;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any Company Employee participates in any defined benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries such employee will accrue additional benefits for each year of participation in any such defined benefits plan so long as other similarly situated employees of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries are accruing benefits under such plan), to the same extent as such service was taken into account under the corresponding plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their respective predecessors) for those purposes. Company Employees and their dependents will be immediately eligible to participate, without waiting time, in any employee benefit plans of Parent and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to such Employees to the extent such employee benefit plans replace comparable Plans in which such individuals participated immediately before the Effective Time, and will not be subject to any pre-existing condition limitation or actively at work requirements under any health plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries for any condition for which they would have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which they participated prior to the Effective Time. Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to give such Company Employees credit under such plans for the year in which the Effective Date occurs for co-payments made and deductibles satisfied prior to the Effective Time.   

 (d) For so long after the Effective Time as the Company or any of its Subsidiaries maintains a 401(k) plan (all such plans, the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "), and Parent maintains a 401(k) plan with a loan feature for similarly situated employees, Parent shall cause the Company 401(k) Plan to retain the loan feature of such plan.   

 (e) Section 5.07(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the aggregate target bonus opportunity of all Company Employees under the Bonus Plans (as defined below) for the 2005 fiscal year. Parent shall cause the Company to continue to maintain the Companys 2005 annual bonus plan(s) set forth in Section 3.09(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Bonus Plans_ ") for the 2005 fiscal year and shall pay Company Employees all bonus amounts due under such Bonus Plans pursuant to the terms of the Bonus Plans. Company performance in respect of calculations made under the Bonus Plans, to the extent applicable for fiscal year 2005 shall be calculated without use of any negative discretion and without taking into account any expenses or costs associated with or arising as a result of transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any non-recurring charges that would not reasonably be expected to have been incurred had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred. Participants who are terminated by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries without cause following the Effective    ##### 

  

    

Time but prior to payment of bonuses for fiscal year 2005 will be paid a pro
rata bonus when bonuses are paid for the fiscal year based on the number of
days such participant was employed prior to the end of the 2005 fiscal year,

 SECTION 5.09. _Proxy Statement_. The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, subject to the prior review and approval of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, a preliminary Proxy Statement (the " _Preliminary Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Merger as required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Company shall obtain and furnish the information required to be included in the Preliminary Proxy Statement, shall provide Parent with, and consult with Parent regarding, any comments that may be received from the SEC or its staff with respect thereto, shall, subject to the prior review and approval of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), respond promptly to any such comments made by the SEC or its staff with respect to the Preliminary Proxy Statement, shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders at the earliest reasonably practicable date and shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to _Section 5.02_) to obtain the necessary approval of the Merger by its stockholders.   

 SECTION 5.10. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it that is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other existing facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in the failure of any of the conditions to the others obligation to consummate the Closing set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.10_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any of the parties receiving such notice; _and provided_ , _further_ , that the failure to deliver any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.10_ shall not be considered in determining whether the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ have been satisfied.   

 SECTION 5.11. _Litigation_. In the event that any action, suit, proceeding or investigation relating hereto or to the transactions contemplated hereby is commenced, whether before or after the date hereof, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend vigorously against it and respond thereto.

 SECTION 5.12. _Subsequent Filings_. Until the Effective Time, the Company will timely file with the SEC each form, report and document required to be filed by the Company under the Exchange Act and will promptly deliver to Parent copies of each such report filed with the SEC.    ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 5.13. _Press Releases_. Parent and the Company will consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation (and affording the other party an opportunity to comment thereon), except as may be required by applicable Law or stock exchange or NASDAQ requirements.

Nothing in this _Section 7.02_ shall relieve any party to this Agreement of liability for any willful breach of this Agreement.   

 SECTION 7.03. _Fees and Expenses_. (a) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , within five days following any termination of this Agreement (other than a termination by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(e)_ or  _(f)_ or a termination by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.01(g)_), Parent shall reimburse the Company for the reasonable costs and expenses of preparing and filing the Proxy Statement with the SEC.   

 (b) The Company shall pay to Parent a fee of thirty-three million dollars ($33,000,000) (the " _Fee_ "), if this Agreement is terminated as follows:

 (ii) if (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to  _Section 7.01(d)_ and (B) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made public and not withdrawn prior to the taking of the vote at the Special Meeting, then, if any Alternative Transaction is consummated, or a Company Acquisition Agreement is entered into, within 12 months after the date of such termination which Alternative Transaction is later consummated, the Company shall pay the Fee on the date of such consummation;    ##### 

  

   

 (iii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.01(f)_, then the Company shall pay the Fee on the Business Day following such termination; or    

 (iv) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.01(g)_ , then the Company shall pay the Fee prior to or simultaneously with the termination.

replaced by "50%".    

 (c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 7.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement. The Company acknowledges that it is obligated to pay to Parent any amounts due pursuant to this _Section 7.03_ whether or not the stockholders of the Company have approved this Agreement.   

 SECTION 7.04. _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, at any time before or after adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company but, after any such stockholder approval, no amendment shall be made which decreases the Merger Consideration or which adversely affects the rights of the Companys stockholders hereunder without the approval of the stockholders of the Company. This Agreement may not be amended, changed, supplemented or otherwise modified except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties.   

 SECTION 7.05. _Extension; Waiver; Remedies_. (a) At any time prior to the Effective Time, each party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein by any other applicable party or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto by any other applicable party or (iii) waive compliance by any party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.   

 (b) All rights, powers and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise of any thereof by any party shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such right, power or remedy by such party. The failure of any party hereto to exercise any rights, power or remedy provided under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other party hereto with its obligations hereunder, and any custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a waiver by such party of its right to exercise any such or other right, power or remedy or to demand such compliance.    ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE VIII    

MISCELLANEOUS    

 SECTION 8.01. _Representations and Warranties_. (a) The representations and warranties made in _Articles III_ and _IV_ shall not survive beyond the Effective Time.   

 (b) For purposes of determining whether any representation or warranty of the Company contained in _Article III_ (including, for avoidance of doubt, any such representation or warranty specifying that any information has been provided or is set forth in the Disclosure Letter) is untrue or incorrect for any purpose under this Agreement, or whether the Company shall have breached any such representation or warranty as a result of any such untruth or incorrectness for any purpose under this Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, in each case, including for the purpose of determining whether such representation or warranty is true and correct when made and for purposes of determining whether such representation or warranty can be made at the Closing), the following standards shall apply:    

 (i) Any such representation and warranty (other than those referred to in clause (ii) or (iv) below) shall be deemed to be untrue or incorrect only if the fact, circumstance, change or event that resulted in such untruth or incorrectness, individually or when taken together with all other facts, circumstances, changes or events inconsistent with such representation or warranty, has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company (disregarding for this purpose any reference to materiality or Material Adverse Effect contained in any such representation or warranty);    

 (ii) Any representation and warranty contained in _Sections 3.01_ (Organization and Qualification), _3.03_ (Authority for this Agreement; Board Action), _3.04_  (Consents and Approvals; No Violation), _3.08_ (Brokers; Certain Expenses), or  _3.22_ (Rights Agreement) shall be deemed to be untrue and incorrect only if such representation and warranty is untrue or incorrect in any material respect; and    

 (iii) Any representation and warranty contained in _Section 3.02_ (Capitalization) or _3.06(a)_ (Absence of a Material Adverse Effect) shall be deemed to be untrue and incorrect only if such representation and warranty is untrue or incorrect in any respect, except for _de minimis_ failures to be true and correct.   

 (c) No representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained in _Article IV_ shall be deemed untrue or incorrect for any purpose under this Agreement, and Parent and Merger Sub shall not be deemed to have breached any such representation or warranty for any purpose under this Agreement, in any case as a consequence of the existence or absence of any fact, circumstance, change or event unless such fact, circumstance, change or event, individually or when taken together with all other facts, circumstances, changes or events inconsistent with any representations or warranties contained in _Article IV_ has had or would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the Merger.    ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 8.02. _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with the Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to subject matter hereof. The Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other parties, _provided_ , that Parent or Merger Sub may assign any of their respective rights and obligations to any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, of its obligations hereunder.   

 SECTION 8.03. _Enforcement of the Agreement; Jurisdiction_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any Delaware state or Federal court located in the City of Wilmington, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any such court in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than any such court and (d) waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to or arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in Delaware state or Federal courts located in the City of Wilmington, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.   

 SECTION 8.04. _Validity_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any jurisdiction such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been contained herein.   

 SECTION 8.05. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be given (and shall be deemed to have been duly received if given) by hand delivery in writing or by facsimile or electronic transmission, in each case, with confirmation of receipt, as follows:    #####
