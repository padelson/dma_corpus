that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger (as defined
below), are advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, their respective stockholders;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously adopted resolutions approving

conditions set forth in <U>Article&nbsp;VI</U> (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing (as defined below) but subject to the satisfaction or waiver, if
permissible, thereof). The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the

Effect with respect to the Company (disregarding for this purpose any reference to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect contained in any such representation or warranty);

Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to subject matter hereof.
The Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by operation of law or otherwise without the prior
written consent of the other parties, <U>provided</U>, that Parent or Merger Sub may assign any of
their respective rights and obligations to any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, but no such
assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, of its obligations hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 8.03. <U>Enforcement of the Agreement; Jurisdiction</U>. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any
Delaware state or Federal court located in the City of Wilmington, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties
hereto (a)&nbsp;consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any such court in the event
any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (c)&nbsp;agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than any such
court and (d)&nbsp;waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to or arising
out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement. The parties irrevocably
and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in Delaware state or Federal
courts located in the City of Wilmington, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally waive
and agree not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding brought
in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 8.04. <U>Validity</U>. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision
of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any jurisdiction such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had
never been contained herein.
