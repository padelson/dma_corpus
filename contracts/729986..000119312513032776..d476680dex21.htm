prior to the Effective Time change the method of effecting the combination
with Virginia Commerce (including, without limitation, the provisions of this
Article II) if and to the extent it deems such change to be necessary,
appropriate or desirable; provided, that no such change shall (i) alter or

tax-free treatment of the Merger to Virginia CommerceÂ’s stockholders as a
result of receiving the Merger Consideration, or (iii) materially impede or
delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
provided further, that Buyer shall provide Virginia Commerce prior written
notice of such change and the reasons therefor.

(c) Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII, the Merger shall become effective upon (i) (A) the filing with

(d) The Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable
law.

2.02 _Effective Date and Effective Time._

 

(a) Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII, the parties shall cause the effective date of the Merger (the "
_Effective Date_ ") to occur on either (i) the fifth business day to occur
after the last of the conditions set forth in Article VIII shall have been

of the Merger (or, at the election of Buyer, on the last business day of the
month in which such fifth business day occurs), or (ii) such other date to
which the parties may agree in writing. The time on the Effective Date when
the Merger shall become effective is referred to as the " _Effective Time_."

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if
Buyer shall exercise its right to delay the Effective Date pursuant to Section

8  record date for any dividend or other distribution in respect of the Buyer
Common Stock is taken during the period of such delay such that the Virginia

each stockholder of Virginia Commerce shall be entitled to receive, upon
surrender of the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the
other provisions of Article IV, a payment equal to the amount and kind of
dividend or other distribution that such holder would have received had such
holder been a holder of record of the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable to
such holder in the Merger on the record date for such dividend or
other distribution.

substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit D_ , the separate existence of

qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the

transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ ,

waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII, it being agreed that any

date to which the parties may agree in writing.

distribution with respect to such Virginia Commerce Common Stock with a
record date occurring prior to the Effective Time, the payment, if any, in
lieu of certain dividends on Buyer Common Stock provided for in Section
2.02(b), and the consideration provided under this Article IV. After the
Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of
Virginia Commerce or the Surviving Corporation of shares of Virginia Commerce
Common Stock.

4.03 _Fractional Shares._ Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefore, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger; instead, Buyer shall pay to each holder of Virginia Commerce Common
Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Buyer Common
Stock (after taking into account all Old Certificates registered in the name
of such holder or Book-Entry Shares held by such holder) an amount in cash
(without interest) determined by multiplying such fraction by the average of
the daily closing prices for the shares of Buyer Common Stock for the 20
consecutive full trading days on which such shares are

 



10  actually traded on the NASDAQ (as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ or,
if not reported thereby, any other authoritative source) ending at the close
of trading on the tenth trading day (the " _Determination Date_ ")
immediately preceding the Effective Date) (the " _Average Closing Price_ ").

4.04 _Exchange Procedures._

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit, or shall cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
certificates formerly representing shares of Virginia Commerce Common Stock ("
_Old Certificates_ ") and holders of non-certificated shares of Virginia
Commerce Common Stock (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), for exchange in accordance
with this Article IV, (i) certificates representing shares of Buyer Common
Stock or non-certificated shares of Buyer Common Stock (collectively, " _New
Certificates_ ") and (ii) an amount of cash necessary for payments required by
Section 4.03 (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund will be distributed
in accordance with the Exchange AgentÂ’s normal and customary procedures
established in connection with merger transactions.

 

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and in no event later
than five business days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each
holder of record of one or more Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Old
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for New Certificates, if any,
that the holders of the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are entitled to
receive pursuant to Article IV, any cash in lieu of fractional shares into
which the shares of Virginia Commerce Common Stock represented by the Old
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement and any payment required pursuant to Section 2.02(b) of this
Agreement. Upon proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such
properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (i) a New Certificate representing that number of whole shares of
Buyer Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Article IV, if any, (ii) a check representing the amount of any cash in lieu
of fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered pursuant to the
provisions of this Article IV, and (iii) any payment required by Section
2.02(b), and the Old Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled.

 

(c) Neither the Exchange Agent, if any, nor any party hereto shall be liable
to any former holder of Virginia Commerce Common Stock for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

(d) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Buyer Common Stock
with a record date occurring after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate or Book-Entry Shares representing
shares of Virginia Commerce Common Stock converted in the Merger into the
right to receive shares of such Buyer Common Stock until the

 



11  holder thereof shall be entitled to receive New Certificates in exchange
therefore in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 4.04.
After becoming so entitled in accordance with this Section 4.04, the record
holder thereof also shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other
distributions by the Exchange Agent, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock
such holder had the right to receive upon surrender of the Old Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares.

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Virginia Commerce on the business day after the one-year
anniversary of the Effective Date shall be paid to Buyer. Any stockholders of
Virginia Commerce who have not theretofore complied with this Article IV
shall thereafter look only to Buyer for payment of the Merger Consideration,
cash in lieu of any fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions
on Buyer Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Virginia
Commerce Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.

4.05 _Anti-Dilution Provisions._ In the event Buyer changes (or establishes a
record date for changing) the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock issued
and outstanding prior to the Effective Date as a result of a stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization or
similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Buyer Common Stock and the
record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Date, or shall establish
a record date prior to the Effective Date with respect to any dividend or
other distribution in respect of the Buyer Common Stock other than a cash
dividend consistent with past practice, the Exchange Ratio shall
be proportionately adjusted to provide the holders of Virginia Commerce
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event.

4.06 _Options._ At the Effective Time, the holders of each outstanding option
(each, a " _Virginia Commerce Stock Option_ ") to purchase shares of Virginia
Commerce Common Stock, whether vested or unvested as of the date of this
Agreement, under any and all plans of Virginia Commerce under which stock
options have been granted (collectively, the " _Virginia Commerce Stock Plans_
") shall vest pursuant to the terms thereof and shall be converted into an
option (each, a " _Replacement Option_ ") to acquire, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Virginia Commerce Stock Option, the
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to (a) the number of shares of
Virginia Commerce Common Stock subject to the Virginia Commerce Stock Option
multiplied by (b) the Exchange Ratio. Such product shall be rounded down to
the nearest whole number. The exercise price per share (rounded up to the
next whole cent) of each Replacement Option shall equal (y) the exercise price
per share of shares of Virginia Commerce Common Stock that were purchasable
pursuant to such Virginia Commerce Stock Option divided by (z) the Exchange
Ratio. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Virginia Commerce Stock Option that
is intended to be an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of
the Code) shall be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section
424 of the Code and all other options shall be adjusted in a manner that
maintains the options exemption from Section 409A of the Code. At or prior to
the Effective Time, Virginia Commerce shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain any necessary consents from optionees with respect to the Virginia
Commerce Stock Plans to permit replacement of the outstanding Virginia
Commerce Stock Options by Buyer pursuant to this Section and to permit
Buyer to assume the Virginia

 



12  Commerce Stock Plans. Virginia Commerce shall further take all action
necessary to amend the Virginia Commerce Stock Plans to eliminate automatic
grants or awards thereunder following the Effective Time. At the Effective
Time, Buyer shall assume the Virginia Commerce Stock Plans; provided that such
assumption shall only be with respect to the Replacement Options and shall
have no obligation to make any additional grants or awards under the Virginia
Commerce Stock Plans.

4.07 _Warrants._

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each TRUPs Warrant which is then outstanding and
unexercised shall cease to represent a right to acquire Virginia Commerce
Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into a warrant to purchase
shares of Buyer Common Stock (a " _Surviving TRUPs Warrant_ ") in an amount
and at an exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise subject
to the terms under which such TRUPs Warrant was granted, including vesting
rights, the agreements evidencing grants thereunder and any other agreements
between Virginia Commerce and a warrant holder regarding TRUPs Warrants): 

(i) the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to be subject to the Surviving
TRUPs Warrant will be equal to the product of the number of shares of
Virginia Commerce Common Stock subject to the original TRUPs Warrant and the
Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that any fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock
resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the next whole
share; and

(ii) the exercise price per share of Buyer Common Stock under the Surviving
TRUPs Warrant shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Virginia
Commerce Common Stock under the original TRUPs Warrant divided by the Exchange
Ratio; _provided_ that if the exercise price resulting from such division
results in a fractional cent, the exercise price shall be rounded up to the
next cent.

(b) At the Effective Time each Treasury Warrant which is then outstanding and
unexercised shall cease to represent a right to acquire Virginia Commerce
Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into a warrant to purchase
shares of Buyer Common Stock (a " _Surviving Treasury Warrant_ ") in an
amount and at an exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise
subject to the terms of such Treasury Warrant):

 

(i) the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock to be subject to the Surviving
Treasury Warrant will be equal to the product of the number of shares of
Virginia Commerce Common Stock subject to the original Treasury Warrant and
the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a share; and

(ii) the exercise price per share of Buyer Common Stock under the Surviving
Treasury Warrant shall be equal to the quotient of the exercise price per
share of Virginia Commerce Common Stock under the original Treasury Warrant
divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent.

4.08  _Withholding Rights_. Buyer or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be,
will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this

 



13  Agreement to any Person such amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority by or on
behalf of Buyer or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, such amounts
withheld will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Buyer or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either in
response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof
or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in
Section 6.03 or 6.04 or to one or more of its covenants contained in Article
V; _provided_ , that (a) no such item is required to be set forth in a
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty if its
absence would not be reasonably likely to result in the related representation
or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard set forth in
Section 6.02, and (b) the mere inclusion of an item in a Disclosure Schedule
as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an
admission by a party that such item represents a material exception or fact,
event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on the party making the representation. All of
Virginia CommerceÂ’s and BuyerÂ’s representations, warranties and covenants
contained in this Agreement are qualified by reference to its respective

as a result of effects arising solely from actions taken in compliance with a
written request of the other party.

6.02 _Standard._ No representation or warranty of Virginia Commerce or Buyer
contained in Section 6.03 or 6.04 shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and no
party hereto shall be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty, as
a consequence of the existence of any fact, event or circumstance unless such
fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any representation or
warranty contained in Section 6.03 or 6.04 has had or is reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, "knowledge"

from any Governmental Authority (A) asserting that Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries is not in compliance with any of the statutes, regulations, or

BuyerÂ’s knowledge, do any grounds for any of the foregoing exist); and

(iv) since July 1, 2003, is in compliance with the privacy provisions of the

without limitation a non-compete or similar provision). Neither Buyer nor any
of its Subsidiaries is in default under any contract, agreement, commitment,
arrangement, lease, insurance policy or other instrument to which it is a
party, by which its respective assets, business, or operations may be bound or
affected, or under which it or its respective assets, business, or operations
receive benefits, and there has not occurred any event that, with the lapse
of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute such a default.

(l) _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(i) Buyer has Previously Disclosed a complete and accurate list of all
existing bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, pension, retirement,
profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock ownership, stock bonus, stock
purchase, restricted stock, stock option,

 



33  severance, welfare and fringe benefit plans, employment or severance
agreements and all similar practices, policies and arrangements in which any
current or former employee (the " _Buyer Employees_ "), current or former
consultant (the " _Buyer Consultants_ ") or current or former director (the "
_Buyer Directors_ ") of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries participates or to
which any Buyer Employees, Buyer Consultants or Buyer Directors are a party
(the " _Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plans_ ").

(ii) Each Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and with
applicable law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, or any
regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all filings, disclosures and
notices required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act and any other applicable law have been
timely made. Each Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension
benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _Buyer Pension
Plan_ ") and which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a favorable determination letter (including a determination
that the related trust under such Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan is
exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code) from the IRS or the
Compensation and Benefit Plan uses a prototype or volume submitter plan that
is the subject of an IRS opinion or advisory letter, and Buyer is not aware of
any circumstances which could adversely affect such qualification or which
are likely to result in the revocation of any existing favorable determination
letter or in not receiving a favorable determination letter. There is no
material pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened legal action, suit
or claim relating to the Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plans other than
routine claims for benefits. Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has
engaged in a transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect to any
Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to
subject Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA, assuming for purposes of
Section 4975 of the Code that the taxable period of any such transaction
expired as of the date hereof.

(iii) No liability (other than for payment of premiums to the PBGC which have
been made or will be made on a timely basis) under Title IV of ERISA has been
or is expected to be incurred by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries with respect
to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan", within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by
any of them, or any single-employer plan of any entity (a " _Buyer ERISA
Affiliate_ ") which is considered one employer with Buyer under Section
4001(a)(14) of ERISA or Section 414(b) or (c) of the Code (a " _Buyer ERISA
Affiliate Plan_ "). None of Buyer, any of its Subsidiaries or any Buyer ERISA
Affiliate has contributed, or has been obligated to contribute, to a
multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA at any time since
September 26, 1980. No notice of a "reportable event", within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been
waived, has been required to be filed for any Buyer Compensation and Benefit
Plan or by any Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan within the 12-month period ending on
the date hereof, and no such notice will be required to be filed as a result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The PBGC has not
instituted proceedings to terminate any Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate
Plan and, to BuyerÂ’s knowledge, no condition exists that presents a material
risk that such proceedings will

 



34  be instituted. To the knowledge of Buyer, there is no pending investigation
or enforcement action by the PBGC, the DOL or IRS or any other governmental
agency with respect to any Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan. Under each
Buyer Pension Plan and Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan, as of the date of the most
recent actuarial valuation performed prior to the date of this Agreement, the
actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in such actuarial valuation of such Buyer
Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan), did not exceed the then current
value of the assets of such Buyer Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan
and since such date there has been neither an adverse change in the financial
condition of such Buyer Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan nor any
amendment or other change to such Pension Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan that
would increase the amount of benefits thereunder which reasonably could be
expected to change such result.

 

(iv) All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Buyer
Compensation and Benefit Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan or any employee
benefit arrangements under any collective bargaining agreement to which Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party have been timely made or have been
reflected on BuyerÂ’s financial statements. Neither any Buyer Pension Plan
nor any Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan has an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA and all required payments to the PBGC with respect to
each Buyer Pension Plan or Buyer ERISA Affiliate Plan have been made on or
before their due dates. None of Buyer, any of its Subsidiaries or any Buyer
ERISA Affiliate (x) has provided, or would reasonably be expected to be
required to provide, security to any Buyer Pension Plan or to any Buyer ERISA
Affiliate Plan pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code, and (y) has taken
any action, or omitted to take any action, that has resulted, or would
reasonably be expected to result, in the imposition of a lien under Section
412(n) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA.

(v) Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations to provide
retiree health and life insurance or other retiree death benefits under any
Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than benefits mandated by Section
4980B of the Code, and each such Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan may be
amended or terminated without incurring liability thereunder and there has
been no communication to Employees by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries that
would reasonably be expected to promise or guarantee such Employees retiree
health or life insurance or other retiree death benefits on a permanent basis.

(vi) Buyer and its Subsidiaries do not maintain any Buyer Compensation and
Benefit Plans covering foreign Employees.

(vii) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
would not, directly or indirectly (including, without limitation, as a result
of any termination of employment prior to or following the Effective Time)
reasonably be expected to (A) entitle any Buyer Employee, Buyer Consultant or
Buyer Director to any payment (including severance pay or similar
compensation) or any increase in compensation, (B) result in the vesting or
acceleration of any benefits under any Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan or
(C) result in any material increase in benefits payable under any Buyer
Compensation and Benefit Plan.

 



35 (viii) Except for compensation paid to Richard M. Adams, neither Buyer nor any
of its Subsidiaries maintains any compensation plans, programs or
arrangements the payments under which would not reasonably be expected to be
deductible as a result of the limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code and
the regulations issued thereunder.

(ix) As a result, directly or indirectly, of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including, without limitation, as a result of any termination
of employment prior to or following the Effective Time), neither Buyer nor
Virginia Commerce, or any of their respective Subsidiaries will be obligated
to make a payment that would be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment" to an individual who is a "disqualified individual" (as such terms
are defined in Section 280G of the Code), without regard to whether such
payment is reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be
performed in the future.

(x) Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any agreement, taken
any action, or omitted to take any action, with respect to or as part of any
Buyer Compensation and Benefit Plan that is an operational failure under
Section 409A of the Code or that would reasonably be expected to subject Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries to any obligation to report any amount or withhold
any amount as includable in income and subject to tax, interest or any penalty
by any service provider to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries under Section 409A
of the Code or to pay any reimbursement or other payment to any service
provider, as defined under Section 409A of the Code, respecting any such tax,
interest or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

 

(m) _No Brokers_. No action has been taken by Buyer that would give rise to
any valid claim against any party hereto for a brokerage commission, finderÂ’s
fee or other like payment with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, excluding a Previously Disclosed fee to Keefe, Bruyette and
Woods, Inc.

 

(n) _Labor Matters_. Neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
or is bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting that it
or any such Subsidiary has committed an unfair labor practice (within
the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel Buyer
or any such Subsidiary to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or
conditions of employment, nor is there any strike or other labor dispute
involving it or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to BuyerÂ’s knowledge,
threatened, nor is Buyer aware of any activity involving its or any of its
SubsidiariesÂ’ employees seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or
engaging in other organizational activity. 

(o) _Takeover Laws_. Buyer has taken all action required to be taken by it in
order to exempt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby from,
and this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are exempt from,
the requirements of any Takeover Laws applicable to Buyer.

(p) _Environmental Matters_. To BuyerÂ’s knowledge, neither the conduct nor
operation of Buyer or its Subsidiaries nor any condition of any property
presently or previously 

 



36  owned, leased or operated by any of them (including, without limitation, in
a fiduciary or agency capacity), or on which any of them holds a Lien,
violates or violated Environmental Laws and to BuyerÂ’s knowledge no condition
has existed or event has occurred with respect to any of them or any such
property that, with notice or the passage of time, or both, is reasonably
likely to result in liability under Environmental Laws. To BuyerÂ’s knowledge,
neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice from any
person or entity that Buyer or its Subsidiaries or the operation or condition
of any property ever owned, leased, operated or held as collateral or in a
fiduciary capacity by any of them are or were in violation of or otherwise are
alleged to have liability under any Environmental Law, including, but not
limited to, responsibility (or potential responsibility) for the cleanup or
other remediation of any pollutants, contaminants, or hazardous or toxic
wastes, substances or materials at, on, beneath or originating from any such
property.

(q) _Tax Matters_. (i) All Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or
with respect to Buyer and its Subsidiaries have been timely filed (taking into
account all applicable extensions), and all Taxes shown to be due on such Tax
Returns have been paid in full, other than Taxes that are being contested in
good faith, which have not been finally determined, and have been adequately
reserved against in accordance with GAAP on BuyerÂ’s consolidated financial
statements as of December 31, 2012. All assessments for Taxes of Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries due with respect to completed and settled examinations or
any concluded litigations have been fully paid. There are no disputes,
audits, examinations or proceedings pending, or claims asserted, for Taxes
upon Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Buyer nor any of its
Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation period
for the assessment or collection of Tax that remains in effect. Neither Buyer
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability with respect to income,
franchise or similar Taxes that accrued on or before December 31, 2012 in
excess of the amounts accrued with respect thereto that are reflected in the
consolidated financial statements of Buyer as of December 31, 2012. As of the
date hereof, neither Buyer nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of
any conditions that exist that might prevent or impede the Merger from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

(r) _Risk Management Instruments_. Neither Buyer not any of its Subsidiaries
are parties to any interest rate swaps, caps, floors, option agreements,

more of BuyerÂ’s Subsidiaries or their customers.

(s) _Books and Records_. The books and records of Buyer and its Subsidiaries

material default thereunder; and all claims thereunder have been filed in due
and timely fashion.

validly existing in good standing under the laws of the state of its
organization, and is or prior to the Effective Time will be duly qualified to

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no newly chartered Merger Sub
will have previously conducted any business or incurred any liabilities.

statement in any earlier statement in the Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto. Each of Virginia Commerce and Buyer further agrees that if

misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take the
necessary steps to correct the Proxy Statement.

papers of independent auditors), properties, personnel and to such other
information as any party may

 



40  reasonably request and, during such period, it shall furnish promptly to
such other party (i) a copy of each material report, schedule and other
document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities laws, and (ii) all other information concerning the business,
properties and personnel of it as the other may reasonably request. Neither
Buyer or its Subsidiaries nor Virginia Commerce or its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of Buyer, Virginia
Commerce or their respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, or contravene
any applicable law or regulation or binding contract, agreement or arrangement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement; and in any such event, the
parties will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements.

 

(b) Each agrees that it will not, and will cause its representatives not to,
use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 7.05 (as well as any
other information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with the
entering into of this Agreement) for any purpose unrelated to the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Subject to the requirements of law, each party will keep confidential, and
will cause its representatives to keep confidential, all information and
documents obtained pursuant to this Section 7.05 (as well as any other
information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with the entering
into of this Agreement) unless such information (i) was already known to such
party, (ii) becomes available to such party from other sources not known by
such party to be bound by a confidentiality obligation, (iii) is disclosed
with the prior written approval of the party to which such information
pertains or (iv) is or becomes readily ascertainable from published
information or trade sources. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall otherwise fail to be
consummated, each party shall promptly cause all copies of documents or
extracts thereof containing information and data as to another party hereto
to be returned to the party that furnished the same. No investigation by
either party of the business and affairs of the other shall affect or be
deemed to modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
in this Agreement, or the conditions to either partyÂ’s obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
each party shall promptly furnish the other with copies of all monthly and
other interim financial statements produced in the ordinary course of business
as the same shall become available.

7.06 _Acquisition Proposals._ Virginia Commerce agrees that it shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its SubsidiariesÂ’ officers, directors,
agents, advisors and affiliates not to, solicit or encourage inquiries or
proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or
provide any confidential information to, or have any discussions with any
person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal. It shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted
prior to the date of this Agreement with any parties other than Buyer with
respect to any of the foregoing and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition
Proposal. Virginia Commerce will inform Buyer promptly of all relevant details
of any inquiries or contacts by third parties relating to the possible
disposition of the business or the capital stock of Virginia Commerce or any
merger, change or control or other business combination involving Virginia
Commerce. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time the Virginia
Commerce 

 



41  Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable law, Virginia Commerce, in response to a
written Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited after the date of this
Agreement or that did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 7.06,
may furnish non-public information with respect to Virginia Commerce to the
Person who made such Acquisition Proposal and participate in negotiations
regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

7.07 _Takeover Laws._ No party hereto shall take any action that would cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them shall take all necessary steps
within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement from any applicable Takeover Law,
as now or hereafter in effect.

 

7.08 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)._ Buyer and Virginia
Commerce agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain
certain directors and officers of Virginia Commerce in connection with the
Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that the
directors and officers of Virginia Commerce not be subject to a risk of
liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, and for that compensatory
and retentive purposes agree to the provisions of this Section 7.08. The
Virginia Commerce Board, or a committee of "Non-Employee Directors" (as such
term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act) thereof,
shall adopt a resolution providing that the disposition by the directors and
officers of Virginia Commerce Common Stock and Virginia Commerce Stock
Options, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b)
under the Exchange Act.

 

7.09 _Regulatory Applications._

(a) Buyer and Virginia Commerce and their respective Subsidiaries shall
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all
documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each
Party shall use its reasonable efforts to resolve objections, if any, which
may be asserted with respect to the Merger under any applicable law,
regulation or decree, including agreeing to divest any assets, deposits, lines
of business or branches; _provided_ , that Buyer shall not be required to
agree to any condition or take any action if such agreements or the taking of
such action is reasonably likely to result in a condition or restriction
having an effect of the type referred to in Section 8.01(b). Each of Buyer and
Virginia Commerce shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to, all
material written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto agrees to act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party hereto agrees that it
will consult with the other party hereto with respect to the obtaining of all
material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties
and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other party apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion
of

 



42  the transactions contemplated hereby, including advising the other party
upon receiving any communication from a Governmental Authority the consent or
approval of which is required for the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to
believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any required consent or
approval from a Governmental Authority will not be obtained or that the
receipt of such consent or approval may be materially delayed (a " _Regulatory
Communication_ "). Upon the receipt of a Regulatory Communication, without
limiting the scope of the foregoing paragraphs, Buyer shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law (i) promptly advise Virginia Commerce of the
receipt of any substantive communication from a Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) provide Virginia
Commerce with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the preparation of
any response thereto and the preparation of any other substantive submission
or communication to any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and to review any such response, submission
or communication prior to the filing or submission thereof, and (iii) provide
Virginia Commerce with the opportunity to participate in any meetings or
substantive telephone conversations that Buyer or its Subsidiaries or their
respective representatives may have from time to time with any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries to any third party or
Governmental Authority.

 

7.10 _Indemnification._

(a) Following the Effective Date and for a period of six years thereafter,
Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present directors,
officers and employees of Virginia Commerce and its Subsidiaries (each, an "
_Indemnified Party"_ ) against all costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneysÂ’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, " _Costs"_ ) incurred in connection with any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective
Time to the fullest extent that Virginia Commerce is permitted or required to
indemnify (and advance expenses to) its directors and officers under the laws
of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Virginia Commerce Certificate, the
Virginia Commerce By-Laws and any agreement as in effect on the date hereof;
_provided_ that any determination required to be made with respect to whether
an officerÂ’s, directorÂ’s or employeeÂ’s conduct complies with the standards
set forth under Virginia law, the Virginia Commerce Certificate, the Virginia
Commerce By-Laws and any agreement shall be made by independent counsel (which
shall not be counsel that provides material services to Buyer) selected by
Buyer and reasonably acceptable to such officer or director. Buyer shall
comply with any indemnification agreements between Virginia Commerce or its
Subsidiaries on the one hand, and their respective directors and officers on
the other hand; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of Virginia Commerce and
its Subsidiaries, as applicable, agrees to exercise its reasonable best
efforts to obtain amendments to each indemnification agreement applicable to
it

 



43  prior to the Effective Date so that terms of any such agreement aligns with
the time periods set forth in this Section 7.10.

 

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, Buyer shall
(i) maintain in effect (A) the current provisions regarding indemnification
of and the advancement of expenses to Indemnified Parties contained in the
Virginia Commerce Certificate and Virginia Commerce By-Laws (or comparable
organizational documents) of each of Virginia Commerce and its Subsidiaries
and (B) any indemnification agreements of Virginia Commerce and its
Subsidiaries with or for the benefit of any Indemnified Parties existing on
the date hereof, and (ii) indemnify the Indemnified Parties to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law. For purposes of the foregoing: (i) in the
event any claim is asserted within the six year period during which Virginia
Commerce and its Subsidiaries, (A) all such rights in respect of any such
claim shall continue until disposition thereof and (B) the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to advancement of expenses within five business days
following receipt of any such claim involving such Indemnified Party; and (ii)
any determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified
PartyÂ’s conduct complies with the standards set forth under VSCA, the Virginia
Commerce Certificate or Virginia Commerce By-Laws or any such agreement, as
the case may be, for purposes of the allowance of indemnification or
advancement of expenses, shall be made by independent legal counsel selected
by such Indemnified Party and reasonably acceptable to Buyer. The fees and
expenses of such independent legal counsel shall be paid for by Buyer.

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide that portion of directorÂ’s and officerÂ’s
liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers
and directors of Virginia Commerce or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as
of the Effective Time) (as opposed to Virginia Commerce) with respect to
claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or events which
occurred before the Effective Time, which insurance shall contain at least the
same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less
advantageous, as that coverage currently provided by Virginia Commerce;
_provided_ , that in no event shall Buyer be required to expend more than 200%
of the current amount expended by Virginia Commerce (the " _Insurance Amount_
") to maintain or procure such directors and officers insurance coverage;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if Buyer is unable to maintain or obtain the
insurance called for by this Section 7.10(c), Buyer shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the
Insurance Amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that officers and directors of
Virginia Commerce or any Subsidiary may be required to make application
and provide customary representations and warranties to BuyerÂ’s insurance
carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance.

 

(d) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
7.10(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, shall promptly notify Buyer thereof; _provided_
that the failure so to notify shall not affect the obligations of Buyer under
Section 7.10(a) unless and to the extent that Buyer is actually prejudiced as
a result of such failure.

(e) If Buyer or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or
merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or

 



44  merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any
entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Buyer shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 7.10.

(f) The provisions of this Section 7.10, (i) shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives, and (ii) are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such person may have by agreement or otherwise.

7.11 _Benefit Plans. _

(a) At and following the Effective Time (i) Buyer shall provide employees of
Virginia Commerce and its Subsidiaries with employee benefit plans
substantially similar to those provided to similarly situated employees of
Buyer, except with respect to the Buyer Pension Plan, (ii) Buyer shall cause
any and all pre-existing condition limitations (to the extent such
limitations did not apply to a pre-existing condition under the Compensation
and Benefit Plans) and eligibility waiting periods under group health plans to
be waived with respect to such employees and their eligible dependents,
and (iii) all employees of Virginia Commerce and its Subsidiaries shall
receive credit for years of service with Virginia Commerce, its Subsidiaries
and their predecessors prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility
and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual other than accrual for
vacation or paid time off; _provided_ , that, in accordance with BuyerÂ’s
policies, no vacation or paid time off shall be thereafter carried over into a
subsequent calendar year) under BuyerÂ’s benefit plans, except with respect to
the Buyer Pension Plan. All employees of Virginia Commerce and its
Subsidiaries and their eligible dependents will receive credit for co-
payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums satisfied by such employees
and dependents under the Compensation and Benefit Plans. Except as provided in
this Agreement, Buyer shall maintain Virginia CommerceÂ’s and its SubsidiariesÂ’
existing employee benefit plans until such time as Buyer has provided similar
plans to employees of Virginia Commerce and its Subsidiaries as contemplated
in the preceding sentence. Employees of Virginia Commerce and its Subsidiaries
shall not be entitled to accrual of benefits or allocation of
contributions under BuyerÂ’s benefit plans based on years of service with
Virginia Commerce, its Subsidiaries and their predecessors prior to the
Effective Date, except with respect to any vacation or paid time off accrual.

 

(b) Except for employees of Virginia Commerce and its Subsidiaries with
individual agreements that provide for payment of severance under certain
circumstances (who will be paid severance only in accordance with such
agreements and shall not have a right to employer-paid outplacement services),
Buyer agrees that each employee of Virginia Commerce and its Subsidiaries who
is involuntarily terminated by Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
for cause) on or within six months of the Effective Date, shall receive (i) a
severance payment equal to two weeks of base pay (at the rate in effect on the
termination date) for each year of service at Virginia Commerce or its
Subsidiaries (with credit for partial years of service) with a minimum payment
equal to four weeks of base pay and a maximum payment equal to twenty-six
weeks of base pay and (ii) reimbursement of costs associated with reasonable
outplacement services actually incurred no later than the date that is six
months after the date of

 



45  the employeeÂ’s termination of employment, so that after reimbursement, such
services will be at no cost to the employee; provided that (A) documentation
of such expenses is provided to Buyer by the terminated employee and (B) such
services are provided by an outplacement agency selected by Buyer.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Virginia Commerce shall one hundred percent
vest all accrued benefits provided under Virginia CommerceÂ’s 401(k) plan,
subject to consummation of the Merger. Buyer and Virginia Commerce shall use
reasonable efforts to take such action as may be necessary to merge Virginia
CommerceÂ’s 401(k) plan with and into BuyerÂ’s 401(k) plan, including, in
BuyerÂ’s sole discretion, the receipt of a favorable determination letter from
the IRS relating to such merger.

(d) At and following the Effective Time, Buyer shall honor, and Buyer shall be
obligated to perform, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to honor and perform,
in accordance with their terms and applicable law, the contractual rights of
Employees, Consultants and Directors of Virginia Commerce and its Subsidiaries
existing as of the Effective Time.

 

7.12 _Notification of Certain Matters._ Each of Virginia Commerce and Buyer
shall give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance
known to it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with
all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any
Material Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute
a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein.

 

7.13 _Directors and Officers._

(a) Buyer agrees to cause two individuals from Virginia Commerce to be
appointed as directors of Buyer at the Effective Time. The individuals shall
be chosen by Virginia Commerce, subject to consent by Buyer, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

Virginia Commerce to be appointed to serve as President of Buyer Bank at the
effective time of the Bank Merger.

local and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments,
orders or decrees applicable thereto or to employees conducting such
businesses.

7.15 _Assumption of TRUPs._ Buyer acknowledges that VCBI Capital Trust II,
VCBI Capital Trust III, and VCBI Capital Trust IV hold subordinated debentures
issued by Virginia

 



46  Commerce and has issued preferred securities which are intended to be
"qualified trust preferred securities" as defined in applicable regulatory
capital guidelines, or which are eligible for such treatment as grandfathered
trust preferred securities. Buyer agrees that at the Effective Time, it shall
expressly assume all of Virginia CommerceÂ’s obligations under the indentures
relating to such subordinated debentures (including, without limitation,
being substituted for Virginia Commerce) and execute any and all documents,
instruments and agreements, including any supplemental indentures, guarantees,
or declarations of trust required by said indentures, the subordinated
debentures or the trust preferred securities issued by VCBI Capital Trust II,
VCBI Capital Trust III, and VCBI Capital Trust IV, or as may reasonably be
requested by the trustees thereunder, and thereafter shall perform all of
Virginia CommerceÂ’s obligations with respect to the subordinated debentures
and the trust preferred securities issued by VCBI Capital Trust II, VCBI

adjusting the Exchange Ratio (calculated to the nearest one one-thousandth)
to equal the lesser of (x) a number (rounded to the nearest one one-
thousandth) obtained by dividing (A) the product of the Starting Price, 0.80
and the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the Average Closing Price
and (y) a number (rounded to the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by
dividing (A) the product of the Index Ratio and the Exchange Ratio (as then in
effect) by (B) the Buyer Ratio. If Buyer so elects within such five-
day period, it shall give prompt written notice to Virginia Commerce of such
election and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have
occurred pursuant to this Section 9.01(i) and this Agreement shall remain in
effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have
been so modified.)

For purposes of this Section 9.01(i), the following terms shall have the

this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this Article IX,
no party to this Agreement shall have any liability or further obligation to
any other party hereunder except (i) as set forth in Section 9.03, (ii) that
termination will not relieve a breaching party from liability for any willful
breach of this Agreement giving rise to such termination, and (iii) Sections
7.03(b), 7.05(b), 9.02, 9.03, 10.05, 10.06, 10.07, 10.08, 10.09 and 10.10

" _Fee_ "), which amount shall be payable in immediately available funds or
(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section 9.01(g), and
prior to that date that is 12 months after such termination, Virginia Commerce
or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any Acquisition Agreement or any
Acquisition Proposal is consummated (regardless of whether such Acquisition
Proposal is consummated before or after termination of this Agreement), then
Virginia Commerce shall pay Buyer the Fee on the earlier of such date of
execution or consummation, which amount shall be payable in immediately
available funds. For the purposes of this Section, " _Acquisition Agreement_
" shall mean any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, or other similar agreement

definition of " _Acquisition Proposal_ " in Section 1.01 except that the
references to "24.99%" shall be deemed to be references to "51%." In no event
shall Virginia Commerce be required to pay the Fee on more than one occasion.

(b) In the event that Virginia Commerce shall fail to pay the Fee when due,
then Virginia Commerce shall pay the Fee plus the costs and expenses actually
incurred by Buyer (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of
counsel) in connection with the collection of the Fee under the enforcement of
this Section 9.03, together with interest on such unpaid Fee and costs and
expenses, commencing on the date that the Fee became due, at a rate equal to
the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank, N.A., from time to time,
in the City of New York, as such bankÂ’s Base Rate plus 2.00%.

PLAN OF MERGER

merging

 

VIRGINIA COMMERCE BANCORP, INC.,

a Virginia bank holding company,

with and into

 

GEORGE MASON BANKSHARES, INC.,

a Virginia second-tier bank holding company.

1\. _Merger_. Virginia Commerce Bancorp, Inc. ("VCBI"), a Virginia bank
holding company incorporated pursuant to the Virginia Stock Corporation Act
(the "VSCA"), shall upon the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.a) be
merged (the "Merger") with and into George Mason Bankshares, Inc., a Virginia
second-tier banking holding Company incorporated pursuant to the VSCA ("George
Mason") and a wholly owned subsidiary of United Bankshares, Inc. ("UBSI"), a
West Virginia bank holding company incorporated pursuant to the West Virginia
Business Corporation Act, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
VSCA. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of VCBI
shall cease and George Mason shall continue as the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation") following the Merger. The corporate existence of
George Mason, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises, shall continue unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger.

2\. _Effective Time; Effects of the Merger_.

 

a. The Merger shall become effective at the latest of (i) the issuance by the
Virginia State Corporation Commission (the "SCC") of a certificate of merger
relating to the Merger; and (ii) the time set forth in articles of merger
relating to the Merger filed with the SCC; such time referred to herein as the
"Effective Time."

 

b. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in
Section 13.1-721 of the VSCA. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time the separate
corporate existence of VCBI shall cease and all of the properties, rights,
powers, privileges, franchises, patents, trademarks, licenses, registrations,
and other assets of every kind and description of VCBI shall be vested in,
and all debts, liabilities and obligations of VCBI shall be the obligation of,
George Mason as the Surviving Corporation, all without further act or deed, in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the VSCA.

3\. _Articles of Incorporation_. The Articles of Incorporation of George Mason
in effect at the Effective Time shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, until the same shall thereafter be altered, amended or
repealed as provided therein or by applicable law.

 



B-1  4\. _Bylaws_. The Bylaws of George Mason in effect at the Effective Time shall
be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until the same shall thereafter
be altered, amended or repealed as provided therein or by applicable law.

5\. _Board of Directors; Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the
directors of George Mason immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly
appointed or elected. From and after the Effective Time, the officers of
George Mason immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly appointed or
elected. At the Effective Time, the VCBI Nominees (as defined in Section 10)
shall be appointed to the Board of Directors of UBSI.

6\. _Manner and Basis of Converting Securities_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of UBSI, George Mason,
VCBI, or any holder of any shares of capital stock of VCBI, USBI or George
Mason:

a. _VCBI Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each holder of a share of
common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of VCBI ("VCBI Common Stock")
(excluding shares of VCBI Common Stock held by UBSI, George Mason, or any
UBSI or George Mason Subsidiary, in each case other than in a fiduciary
capacity or as a results of debts previously contracted, which shares shall
(i) not be exchanged for shares of UBSI Common Stock and (ii) be canceled and
extinguished for no consideration, and shall be marked "canceled in merger" as
of the Effective Time) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be converted into and exchangeable for the right to
receive 0.5442 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of common stock, $2.50 par value
per share, of UBSI ("UBSI Common Stock") (the "Stock Consideration"). The
Stock Consideration, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares as
provided in Section 6.b below, are referred to herein collectively as the
"Merger Consideration."

Effective as of the Effective Time, each share of VCBI Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and retired and cease to exist, and each holder of certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced shares of VCBI Common Stock
(each, a "VCBI Certificate"), and each holder of non-certificated shares of
VCBI Common Stock ("VCBI Book-Entry Shares") shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
therefor upon surrender of such VCBI Certificate or VCBI Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with Section 7\.

b. _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of UBSI Common Stock shall
be issued in respect of shares of VCBI Common Stock that are to be converted
in the Merger into the right to receive shares of UBSI Common Stock. Holders
of VCBI Common Stock entitled to fractional shares shall be entitled to
receive in lieu of any fractional share of UBSI Common Stock to which such
holder would otherwise have been entitled pursuant to Sections 6.a and 7 an
amount in cash (without interest) (the "Cash Consideration"), rounded to the
nearest whole cent (with one-half cent being rounded upwards), equal to the
product obtained by __multiplying__ (i) the fractional share of UBSI Common
Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after 

 



B-2   taking into account all shares of VCBI Common Stock held by such holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time) __by__ (ii) the average of the daily
closing prices for UBSI Common Stock for the 20 consecutive full trading days
on which such shares are actually traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market
(as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported thereby, any
other authoritative source) ending at the close of trading on the tenth
trading day (the "Determination Date") immediately preceding the Effective
Date (the "Average Closing Price").

c. _Adjustment for Certain Transactions in UBSI Common Stock_. If, on or after
the date of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, by and between UBSI and
VCBI, dated as of January 29, 2013 (the "Merger Agreement") and prior to the
Effective Time, UBSI changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the
number of shares of UBSI Common Stock issued and outstanding as a result of a
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization or similar transaction with respect to the then outstanding
UBSI Common Stock, or establishes a record date prior to the Effective Date
with respect to any dividend or distribution in respect of UBSI Common Stock
other than a cash dividend consistent with past practice, the Exchange Ratio
shall be proportionately adjusted to provide holders of VCBI Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by the Merger Agreement prior to
such action.

d. _Delay in Effective Date; Dividends on UBSI Common Stock_. If UBSI
exercises its right to delay the effective date of the Merger (the "Effective
Date") pursuant to Section 2.02(a)(i) of the Merger Agreement, and during the
period of such delay UBSI sets a record date for any dividend or other
distribution in respect of UBSI Common Stock such that holders of VCBI Common
Stock are not entitled to participate in such dividend, each holder of VCBI
Common Stock shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender of VCBI Certificates
or VCBI Book-Entry Shares, a payment equal to the amount and kind of dividend
or other distribution that such holder would have received had such holder
been a holder of record of the shares of UBSI Common Stock issuable to such
holder in the Merger on the record date for such dividend or other
distribution. 

e. _UBSI and George Mason Common Stock_. Each share of UBSI Common Stock and
each share of George Mason Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be unchanged, and shall continue to represent an issued
and outstanding share of UBSI Common Stock and an issued and outstanding share
of George Mason Common Stock, respectively.

 

f. _VCBI Common Stock Held by UBSI and George Mason_. All shares of VCBI
Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by UBSI, George Mason or any
of UBSIÂ’s or George MasonÂ’s respective wholly owned subsidiaries (other than
shares held in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts previously
contracted) shall be cancelled and retired and shall not represent capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be exchanged for the Merger
Consideration; such cancelled and retired shares are referred to herein as the
"Excluded Shares".

 



B-3  g. _VCBI Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each option (the "VCBI
Options"), whether or not vested or exercisable, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the VCBI 1998 Stock Option Plan
(the "VCBI 1998 Plan") and the VCBI 2010 Equity Plan (the "VCBI 2010
Plan") will by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any
holder of a VCBI Option vest pursuant to the terms thereof and shall be
converted into an option (each, a "Replacement Option") to acquire, on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under such VCBI Option, the
number of shares of UBSI Common Stock equal to (a) the number of shares of
VCBI Common Stock subject to the VCBI Option multiplied by (b) the Exchange
Ratio, and such product shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
The exercise price per share of each Replacement Option shall equal (y) the
exercise price per share of shares of VCBI Common Stock that were purchasable
pursuant to such VCBI Option divided by (z) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to
the next whole cent. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Section
6.g, it is the intention of the parties that the assumption of VCBI Options
hereunder shall meet the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code, and that
each Replacement Option shall qualify immediately after the Effective Time as
an incentive stock option (as defined in Section 422 of the Code) to the
extent the related VCBI Option so qualified immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and that each other Replacement Option shall be adjusted in a
manner that maintains the options exemption from Section 409A of the Code, and
the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.g shall be interpreted to further
such purpose and intention. Prior to the Effective Time, VCBI shall take any
and all actions under the VCBI 1998 Plan and the VCBI 2010 Plan necessary to
effectuate this Section 6.g., including, without limitation, amending the
VCBI 1998 Plan and the VCBI 2010 Plan to eliminate automatic grants or awards
thereunder following the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, UBSI shall
assume the VCBI 1998 Plan and the VCBI 2010 Plan; provided that such
assumption shall only be with respect to the Replacement Options and shall
have no obligation to make any additional grants or awards under the VCBI 1998
Plan and the VCBI 2010 Plan.

h. _Warrants_.

(i) At the Effective Time, each warrant originally issued in connection with
an offering of trust preferred securities (the "TRUPs Warrant") which is then
outstanding and unexercised shall cease to represent a right to acquire VCBI
Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into a warrant to purchase
shares of UBSI Common Stock (a "Surviving TRUPs Warrant") in an amount and at
an exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise subject to the
terms under which such TRUPs Warrant was granted, including vesting rights,
the agreements evidencing grants thereunder and any other agreements between
VCBI and a warrant holder regarding TRUPs Warrants):

(A) the number of shares of UBSI Common Stock to be subject to the Surviving
TRUPs Warrant will be equal to the product of the number of shares of VCBI
Common Stock subject to the original TRUPs Warrant and the Exchange Ratio;
_provided_ that any fractional shares of VCBI Common Stock resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down to the next whole share; and

(B) the exercise price per share of UBSI Common Stock under the Surviving
TRUPs Warrant shall be equal to the exercise price per share of VCBI Common
Stock 

 



B-4   under the original TRUPs Warrant divided by the Exchange Ratio; _provided_
that if the exercise price resulting from such division results in a
fractional cent, the exercise price shall be rounded up to the next cent.

(ii) At the Effective Time each warrant originally issued to the United States
Department of the Treasury in connection with VCBIÂ’s participation in the
Troubled Asset Relief Program Capital Purchase Program (the "Treasury
Warrant") which is then outstanding and unexercised shall cease to represent a
right to acquire VCBI Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into
a warrant to purchase shares of UBSI Common Stock (a "Surviving Treasury
Warrant") in an amount and at an exercise price determined as provided below
(and otherwise subject to the terms of such Treasury Warrant):

(A) the number of shares of UBSI Common Stock to be subject to the Surviving
Treasury Warrant will be equal to the product of the number of shares of VCBI
Common Stock subject to the original Treasury Warrant and the Exchange Ratio,
rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a share; and

 

(B) the exercise price per share of UBSI Common Stock under the Surviving
Treasury Warrant shall be equal to the quotient of the exercise price per
share of VCBI Common Stock under the original Treasury Warrant divided by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a cent.

7\. _VCBI Common Stock Exchange Procedures_.

a. _Exchange Agent; Merger Consideration_. UBSI shall appoint its transfer
agent, Computershare Limited, or, with the written consent of VCBI, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, another agent independent of and
unaffiliated with UBSI, George Mason or VCBI (the "Exchange Agent"), for the
purpose of exchanging VCBI Certificates and VCBI Book-Entry Shares for the
Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, UBSI shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the
holders of VCBI Common Stock and for exchange in accordance with this Plan of
Merger, or shall duly authorize and direct issuance by the Exchange Agent in
accordance with this Section 7 of, (i) certificates, or, at UBSIÂ’s
option, evidence of shares in book-entry form, representing the shares of
UBSI Common Stock that constitute the Stock Consideration and (ii) an amount
of cash necessary to pay the Cash Consideration.

 

b. _Surrender of VCBI Certificates and VCBI Book-Entry Shares_. UBSI shall
cause the Exchange Agent, not later than five (5) Business Days after the
Effective Time, to mail to each holder of one or more VCBI Certificates or of
VCBI Book-Entry shares a form letter of transmittal for return to the Exchange
Agent containing instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
VCBI Certificates and VCBI Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration into which the VCBI Common Stock represented by such VCBI
Certificates and VCBI Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted as a result
of the Merger. The letter of transmittal shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the VCBI Certificates and VCBI Book-
Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the VCBI

 



B-5   Certificates and VCBI Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent. Upon proper
surrender of a VCBI Certificate or VCBI Book-Entry Shares for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or compliance with the provisions of
Section 7.e, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such VCBI Certificate or VCBI Book-Entry Shares shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration and the
VCBI Certificate and/or VCBI Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be
cancelled. Any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed by
the holders of VCBI Common Stock on the business day after the one-
year anniversary of the Effective Date shall be paid to UBSI. Any holders of
VBCI Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Section 7.b.
shall thereafter look only to UBSI for payment of the Merger Consideration,
cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on
UBSI Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of VBCI Common Stock
such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to the Merger Agreement, in each
case, without any interest thereon. Subject to all applicable laws of
escheat, such amounts shall be paid to such former shareholder of VCBI,
without interest, upon proper surrender of his or her Certificates or delivery
of an affidavit of loss as described in Section 7.e.

c. _Rounding of Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares_. All dollar amounts payable
to any shareholder as a result of the payment of cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 6.b will be rounded to the nearest whole cent (with
one-half cent being rounded upward), based on the aggregate amount payable for
all shares registered in such shareholderÂ’s name. No interest will be paid or
