ARTICLE IV

 



 

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; 
Exchange of Share Certificates_

 



 

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:

 



 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub
or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares
owned by the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company, and in each case not held on behalf of third parties and (ii) Shares
that are owned by stockholders of the Company who have perfected and not
withdrawn a demand for appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
(the Shares referred to in this clause (ii), " ** _Dissenting Shares_** ", the
holders of such Shares, " ** _Dissenting Stockholders_** ," and the Dissenting
Shares together with the Shares referred to in clause (i), " ** _Excluded
Shares_** ")) shall be converted into the right to receive $35.00 per Share in
cash, without interest (the " ** _Per Share Merger Consideration_** "). At the
Effective Time, each Share converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 4.1(a)_ shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective
Time, and each certificate formerly representing any of the Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) (each, a " ** _Share Certificate_** ") and each book entry
account formerly representing any non-certificated Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) (each, a " ** _Book Entry Share_** ") shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of each
Share represented thereby, without interest.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, as a result
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of such
Excluded Share, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights any
Dissenting Stockholder may have pursuant to _Section 4.2(g)_ with respect to
any Excluded Shares that are Dissenting Shares.

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

 



     

 

 



 

4.2. _Exchange of Share Certificates; Surrender of Book Entry Shares_.

 



 

(a) _Appointment of Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Merger Sub shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to serve as the paying agent (the " ** _Paying Agent_** ") and shall
enter into an agreement reasonably acceptable to the Company relating to the
Paying Agents responsibilities with respect to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent, cash in U.S. Dollars in immediately available funds sufficient in the
aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Payment Agent to make
payments in respect of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) pursuant to
_Section 4.1(a)_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " **
_Payment Fund_** "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than a purpose expressly provided for in this Agreement. Pending its
disbursement in accordance with this _Section 4.2_, the Payment Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent, if and as directed by Parent. Any such
investment, if made, must be made in (i) short-term direct obligations of the
United States of America, (ii) short-term obligations for which the full faith
and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for the
payment of principal and interest, (iii) short-term commercial paper rated the
highest quality by either Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Ratings Services or (iv) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly
replace or restore the cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the
Payment Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying
Agent to make all payments of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration as
contemplated by _Section 4.1(a)_. No investment losses resulting from
investment of the funds deposited with the Paying Agent shall diminish the
rights of any holder of Shares to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
in respect of each Share (other than any Excluded Share) as provided herein.
Payments to holders in respect of Company Options and Company RSUs shall be
paid through the Surviving Corporations applicable payroll procedures at or
as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 



 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three Business
Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) (A) a
notice advising such holders of the effectiveness of the Merger, (B) a letter
of transmittal in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery of the Share
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Share Certificates as
provided in _Section 4.2(f)_) or transfer of the Book Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent (including customary provisions with respect to delivery of an
"agents message" with respect to Book Entry Shares) to the Paying Agent (the
" ** _Letter of Transmittal_** "), and (C) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Share Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Share Certificates as provided in _Section 4.2(f)_) or the Book Entry Shares
to the Paying Agent in exchange for payment of the amount (after giving effect
to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(h)_) of cash
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_.

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of Share Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu of the Share Certificates as provided in _Section 4.2(f)_) or
Book Entry Shares, together with, in the case of Share Certificates, the
Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, or, in the case of Book Entry Shares held through
the Depositary Trust Company, receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying
Agent, and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Share Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Paying Agent shall be
required to deliver to each such holder, a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(h)_) of
cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)_.

 



 

(iii) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon surrender
of any Shares.

 



 

(iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) represented by a Share Certificate or Share Certificates that is not
registered in the stock transfer books and records of the Company or if the
consideration payable is to be paid in a name other than that in which the
Share Certificate or Share Certificates surrendered or transferred in exchange
therefor registered in the stock transfer books and records of the Company, a
check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the Share Certificate or
Share Certificates may be issued to such transferee if the Share Certificate
or Share Certificates formerly representing such Shares are duly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for surrender and presented to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid or are not applicable, in each case, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Paying Agent. Payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration in respect of Book Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person
in whose name such Book Entry Shares are registered in the transfer books and
records of the Company.

 



 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books and records of the Company of the Shares
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of Share
Certificates and Book Entry Shares by the one-year anniversary of the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 4.2(h)_) in respect thereof
upon delivery of the Share Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the
Share Certificates as provided in _Section 4.2(f)_) or surrender of Book
Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, immediately
prior to the date any Per Share Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat
to or

 



     

 

 



 

become the property of any Governmental Authority, such Per Share Merger
Consideration shall become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. For
the purposes of this Agreement, the term " ** _Person_** " means any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Authority or other entity of any kind
or nature.

 



 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Share Certificates_. In the event any Share
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Share Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent
pursuant to the Paying Agent Agreement or otherwise, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may
direct, sufficient to indemnify Parent and the Surviving Corporation against
any claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Share Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Share Certificate a check in the amount (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section
4.2(h)_) equal to the number of Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Share Certificate multiplied by
the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 



 

(g) _Appraisal Rights_. No Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to any Dissenting Share owned
by such Dissenting Stockholder. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled
to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect
to the Dissenting Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder and such
Dissenting Stockholder shall cease to have any other rights with respect to
such Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice and
copies of any written demands for appraisal of Shares, actual, attempted or
purported withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to (or purportedly pursuant to) applicable Law that are received by
the Company relating to the Companys stockholders demands of appraisal after
receipt thereof by the Company, and (ii) shall give Parent the opportunity to
direct and participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, schedule any meeting or make any voluntary payment with respect to any
such demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 



 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as applicable (each a " **
_Withholding Agent_** "), shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " ** _Code_** "), or
any other applicable federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by a Withholding Agent, such withheld amounts (i)
shall be timely remitted by such Withholding Agent to the applicable
Governmental Authority and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made to the extent such withheld amounts are remitted to
the appropriate Governmental Authority, and no Withholding Agent shall be
required to pay any additional amounts with respect to such deducted or
withheld amounts.

 



     

 

 



 

4.3. _Treatment of Stock-Based Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
option to purchase Shares under the Stock Plans (a " ** _Company Option_** "),
whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof be deemed to be vested, be cancelled and shall only
entitle the holder of such Company Option to receive (without interest), at or
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the number of unexercised Shares subject to the
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time _multiplied by_ (ii)
the excess, if any, of (A) the Per Share Merger Consideration over (B) the
exercise price per Share of such Company Option. For purposes of the
calculation set forth in the preceding sentence, the vesting of any Company
Option subject to performance conditions shall be fully accelerated and deemed
achieved contingent and effective upon the Closing. For the avoidance of
doubt, any Company Option which has an exercise price per Share that is
greater than or equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be cancelled
at the Effective Time for no consideration or payment.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
restricted stock unit under the Stock Plans (a " ** _Company RSU_** "),
whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof be deemed to be vested, be cancelled and shall only
entitle the holder of such Company RSU to receive, at or as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the Per Share
Merger Consideration _plus_ any accrued and unpaid dividend equivalents with
respect to such Company RSU; _provided_ , that, with respect to any Company
RSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section
409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid at the Effective Time
without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such
payment shall be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable
Stock Plan and award agreement that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under
Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are
necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Company Options and the Company
RSUs, in each case, pursuant to _Section 4.3(a)_ and _Section 4.3(b)_,
including obtaining the acknowledgements set forth on Section 4.3(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company shall take all actions necessary to
ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or other capital
stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company
Options or Company RSUs. The Surviving Corporation shall, subject to _Section
4.2(h)_, pay through its payroll systems the amounts due in respect of Company
Options and Company RSUs pursuant to _Section 4.3(a)_ and _Section 4.3(b)_.

 



 

4.4. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement to the earlier
of the Effective Time and termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article VIII_, the number of Shares or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares shall have been changed into a
different number of Shares or securities, or a different class, by reason of
any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution,

 



     

 

 



 

recapitalization or other similar transaction the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to provide the holders of Shares,
Company Options and Company RSUs the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in
this _Section 4.4_ shall be construed to permit the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action otherwise prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

ARTICLE V

 



 

 _Representations and Warranties_

 



 

5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
the Company Reports filed by the Company with the SEC since January 1, 2018
and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (excluding, in each
case, any disclosures set forth in any risk factor or in any other section
thereof to the extent they are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in
nature, except to the extent such information consists of factual historical
or current statements) or in the correspondingly numbered sections or
subsections of the disclosure schedule delivered to Parent and Merger Sub by
the Company immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " **
_Company Disclosure Schedule_** ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any
item in any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to the
extent (and only to the extent) that the relevance of such item is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure), the Company hereby represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

 



 

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. The Company is a legal
entity duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of the State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted. The Company is qualified to do business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries and each joint
venture entity set forth in _Section 5.1(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (each, a " ** _Joint Venture Entity_** ") is a legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize such concept or a similar concept) under the Laws
of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate
or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified to
do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal
entity in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its
assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification,
except where the failure to be so organized, existing, qualified or in good
standing, or to have such power or authority, would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made available to Parent, prior to the date of this Agreement,
true, correct and complete copies of each of the Companys Subsidiaries and
each Joint Venture Entitys certificate of incorporation and bylaws or
comparable governing

disclosed, is in full force and effect.

 



 

As used in this Agreement: (i) the term " ** _Subsidiary_** " means, with
respect to any Person, any other Person of which at least a majority of the

Adverse Effect_** " means any effect, change, event, condition, occurrence,
development or state of facts or circumstances that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse
effect on the business, financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities,
or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole; _provided_ , _however_ , that no effect, change, event, condition,
occurrence, development or state of facts or circumstances to the extent
resulting from the following shall on its own constitute or be considered in
determining whether there has occurred a Material Adverse Effect:

 



 

(A) changes in the global economy or capital or financial markets generally;

majeure event, acts of God, acts of war, police or military action, armed
hostilities, sabotage or terrorism;

 



 

(F) the occurrence of any natural disaster;

 



 

(G) a decline in the price or trading volume of the Shares or any change in
the ratings or ratings outlook for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ that the exception in this clause (G) shall not prevent, subject to
the other limitations set forth in this definition, any effect, change, event,
condition, occurrence, development or state of facts or circumstances
underlying such decline from being taken into account in determining whether a
Material Adverse Effect has occurred;

 



 

(H) the announcement or pendency of this Agreement, the Voting Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Merger, the
execution, performance or existence of this Agreement, the identity of the
parties hereto or any of their respective Affiliates, Representatives or
financing sources (including any actual or potential loss or impairment after
the date hereof of any Contract or business relationship as a result of any of
the foregoing) or any Action brought or threatened by shareholders of the
Company

 



     

 

 



 

asserting allegations of breach of fiduciary duty relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that the exception in
this clause (H) shall not apply to references to "Material Adverse Effect" in
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 5.1(d)_ (
_Governmental Filings; No Violations_ );

 



 

(I) any failure by the Company to meet any (or the publication of any report
regarding) projections, forecasts, budgets estimates or outlook of or relating
to the Company or its Subsidiaries, including with respect to revenues or
earnings or other internal or external financial or operating projections;
_provided_ that the exception in this clause (I) shall not prevent subject to

circumstance, occurrence or development underlying such decline from being
taken into account in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has
occurred;

 



 

(J) the taking or not taking of any action at the request of or with the
express consent of Parent or Merger Sub or as expressly required by this
Agreement (including any actual or potential loss or impairment after the date
hereof of any Contract or business relationship as a result of such action or
inaction); or

 



 

(K) any event, condition or circumstance to the extent disclosed on the
Company Disclosure Schedule;

 



 

 _provided_ , _further_ , that, the exceptions in clauses (A) through (D) will
not apply to the extent any such effect, change, event, condition, occurrence,
development or state of facts or circumstances has a disproportionate effect
on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, compared to other
participants in the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries
conduct their businesses.

 



 

(b) _Capital Structure_.

 



 

(i) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 30,000,000 Shares
and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the " **

fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Company or by a direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any Lien,
other than transfer restrictions imposed by any applicable Law; _provided_
that with respect to the equity securities of each Joint Venture Entity, the
foregoing representation is only given with respect to the interests owned by
the Company

 



     

 

 



 

and/or its Subsidiaries in such Joint Venture Entity as set forth in _Section
5.1(b)(ii_ _i_ _)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth in
this _Section 5.1(b)(i)_ and except for securities issued after the date of
this Agreement in compliance with _Section 6.1(b)_, there are no other
outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests
in, the Company, and there are no preemptive or similar rights, options,
warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights,
repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, securities, calls, commitments or
rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, any Joint Venture Entity to issue or sell to any
Person any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any Joint Venture
Entity or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for, or giving any Person (other than the Company or one or more
of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries) a right to subscribe for or acquire, any
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any Joint Venture Entity. Upon any issuance of any Shares in
accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of
any Lien, other than transfer restrictions imposed by applicable securities
Laws. Since the close of business on June 21, 2019, (x) no Shares have been
issued, except pursuant to the exercise of Company Options and the settlement

accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans and (y) no grants or awards of
Company Options, Company RSUs or other awards under the Stock Plans have been
made. The Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or
other obligations, the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible
into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the
stockholders of the Company on any matter. Other than the Voting Agreement,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any Joint Venture Entity is a party to any shareholders agreement,
voting trust agreement, registration rights agreement or other similar
agreement or understanding relating to any voting or equity interests in the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
Joint Venture Entity or any other agreement relating to the disposition,
voting or dividends with respect to any voting or equity interests in the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
Joint Venture Entity.

 



 

(ii) _Section 5.1(b)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a
correct and complete list, as of the close of business on May 17, 2019, of all
outstanding Company Options and Company RSUs granted under the Stock Plans by
holder, including the date of grant, term, number of vested and unvested

was granted in material compliance with all applicable Laws and all of the
terms and conditions of the Stock Plan, (B) if applicable, has an exercise
price per share of Company common stock equal to or greater than the fair
market value of a share of Company common stock on the date of such grant, (C)
qualifies for the Tax and accounting treatment afforded to such Company Option
or Company RSU, as applicable, in the Companys Tax Returns and the Company
Reports, respectively and (D) does not trigger any liability for the holder
thereof under Section

 



     

 

 



 

409A of the Code. For the purposes of this Agreement, " ** _Affiliate_** "
means a Person that directly or indirectly, through one or more
intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with a
second Person.

 



 

(iii) _Section 5.1(b)(ii_ _i_ _)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth (A) each of the Companys Subsidiaries and each Joint Venture Entity and
the ownership interest of the Company in each such Subsidiary and Joint
Venture Entity, together with the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation
of each such Subsidiary and Joint Venture Entity, as well as the ownership
interest of any other Person or Persons in each such Subsidiary or Joint
Venture Entity and (B) the Companys or its Subsidiaries capital stock,
equity interest or other direct or indirect ownership interest in any other
Person, together with the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation of each
such Person. The Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any voting
interest in any Person that requires an additional filing by Parent under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " **
_HSR Act_** ") and any applicable antitrust, competition or merger control
Laws promulgated by any non-U.S. Governmental Authority (and, together with
the HSR Act, " ** _Antitrust Laws_** ") in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

 



 

(i) Assuming the representations set forth in _Section 5.2(g)_ are true, the
Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all
corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger,
subject only to approval of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a stockholders meeting
duly called and held for such purpose (the " ** _Requisite Company Vote_** ").
Assuming the representations set forth in _Section 5.2(g)_ are true, each of
this Agreement and the Voting Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles (the " ** _Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception_** ").

 



 

(ii) The Company Board has (A) unanimously (1) determined that this Agreement,
the Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company
and its stockholders, (2) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and
the Voting Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including the Merger and (3) resolved to recommend that the holders of Shares
adopt this Agreement (the " ** _Company Recommendation_** "); (B) unanimously
directed that this Agreement be submitted to the holders of Shares for their
adoption; and (C) received the opinion of its outside financial advisor, B.
Riley FBR, Inc., to the effect that based on and subject to the assumptions,
procedures, factors, qualifications and limitations set forth therein, the Per
Share Merger Consideration to be received by the holders of Shares pursuant to
this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, as of the date of such
opinion, a copy of which opinion has been delivered to Parent.

 



      

 

 



 

Assuming the representations set forth in _Section 5.2(g)_ are true, the
Company Board has also taken all action so that Parent will not be an
"interested stockholder" or prohibited from entering into or consummating a
"business combination" with the Company (in each case as such term is used in
Section 203 of the DGCL) as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the
Voting Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby in the manner contemplated hereby or thereby.

 



 

(d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations_.

 



 

(i) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and the Voting Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, require no
authorization or other action by or in respect of, or filing with, any (A)
federal, state, local, municipal, foreign or other government; (B)
governmental, quasi-governmental, supranational or regulatory authority
(including any governmental division, department, agency, commission,
instrumentality, organization, unit or body and any court or other tribunal);
or (C) self-regulatory organization (including the NASDAQ Global Market or the
NASDAQ Global Select Market (" ** _NASDAQ_** ")) (each, a " ** _Governmental
Authority_** ") other than (1) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, (2) compliance with any
applicable requirements of the Antitrust Laws, (3) compliance with any
applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the " ** _Exchange Act_** "), the Securities Act and any other applicable
U.S. state or federal securities, takeover or "blue sky" Laws, (4) compliance
with any applicable rules of NASDAQ and (5) where failure to obtain such
authorization or take any such action would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(ii) Assuming the representations set forth in Section 5.2(g) are true, the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, do not and will not (A)
conflict with or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the
Charter or bylaws of the Company or the similar organizational documents of
any of its Subsidiaries, (B) assuming compliance with the matters referred to
in _Section 5.1(d)(i)_, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of
any applicable Law, (C) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
_Section 5.1(d)(i)_, require any consent by any Person under, constitute a
default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default, under, or cause or permit the termination,
modification, cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation or the
loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are
entitled, under (I) any agreement, lease, license, contract, note, mortgage,
indenture, arrangement or other obligation (each a " ** _Contract_** ")
binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to which any of their
respective properties, rights or other assets are subject or (II) any Company
Permit governing the operation of the business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (D) result in the creation or imposition of any mortgage,
lien, license, covenant not to sue, pledge, charge, security interest, deed of
trust, right of first refusal, easement, or similar encumbrance in respect of
such property or asset (each a " ** _Lien_** ") on any property or asset of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of clauses (B), (C)
and (D) above, any such violation,

 



     

 

 



 

breach, conflict, default, right, termination, modification, acceleration,
cancellation, loss or Lien that would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements; Internal Controls_.

 



 

(i) The Company has filed or furnished, as applicable, on a timely basis, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
or furnished by it with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " **
_SEC_** ") pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " ** _Securities Act_** ") since January 1, 2017 (the " **
_Applicable Date_** ") (the forms, statements, certifications, reports and
documents filed or furnished to the SEC since the Applicable Date and those
filed or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement,
including any amendments thereto, the " ** _Company Reports_** "). Each of the
Company Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished (and, if
amended, as of the date of such amendment, and, in the case of the Proxy
Statement, at the date of mailing to shareholders of the Company and at the
time of the Company Shareholders Meeting) complied or, if not yet filed or
furnished, will comply in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to
the Company Reports. As of their respective dates (and, if amended, as of the
date of such amendment), the Company Reports did not, and any Company Reports
filed with or furnished to the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement
will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Company
makes no representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied
by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Representatives in writing
specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement.

 



 

(ii) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ. Following
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company will not be required to be an SEC registrant.

 



 

(iii) The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e), as applicable, under
the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act.
Such disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the SEC and is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The Company maintains a
system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f), as applicable, under the Exchange Act) reasonably
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the
Companys financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Since the Applicable Date,
none of the Companys auditors, the Company Board or the audit committee
thereof have received any oral or written notification of, nor is any such
Person aware of (A) any significant deficiencies or material

 



     

 

 



 

weaknesses in the design or operation of the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information or (B) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Companys internal controls over financial reporting. For purposes of this
Agreement, the terms " ** _significant deficiency_** " and " ** _material
weakness_** " have the meanings assigned to such terms in Auditing Standard
No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect on the
date of this Agreement.

 



 

(iv) The consolidated financial statements included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly present, or, in the case of consolidated financial statements included
in or incorporated by reference into Company Reports filed after the date of
this Agreement, will fairly present, in each case, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and their consolidated
statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders equity and cash
flows for the respective periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end adjustments that would not
be material in amount or effect), in each case in conformity with U.S. GAAP
(except, in the case of the unaudited statements, to the extent permitted by
the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved, except as
may be noted therein or in the notes thereto.

 



 

(v) The books of account of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been kept
accurately in all material respects in the ordinary course of business, the
transactions entered therein represent bona fide transactions, and the
revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries
have been properly recorded therein in all material respects. The corporate
records and minute books of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have been
maintained in accordance with all applicable Laws in all material respects,

6.2. _Acquisition Proposals; Change of Recommendation_.

_Section 6.2_, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
each of their respective directors and officers not to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and its

 



     

 

 



 

Subsidiaries employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors or representatives (such directors, officers, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or representatives,
collectively, " ** _Representatives_** ") not to, directly or indirectly:

 



 

(i) initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate
any inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations relating to any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal,
indication of interest or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal (other than to state that the terms of this provision
prohibit such discussions);

 



 

(iii) provide any information to any Person in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal;

 



 

(iv) subject to _Section 6.2(i)_, waive, terminate, modify or fail to enforce
any "standstill" or confidentiality or similar obligation of any Person (other
than any party hereto) with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
or

 



 

(v) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.2(a)_, prior to
the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, in response
to an Acquisition Proposal not solicited in material violation of this
_Section 6.2_, the Company may:

 



 

(i) contact the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or its Representatives
solely to ascertain the facts or clarify the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(ii) provide information in response to a request therefor (including non-
public information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to the
Person who made such Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that such information
has previously been made available to, or is made available to, Parent
substantially concurrently at the time such information is made available to
such Person (and in any event within 24 hours of such time) and that, prior to
furnishing any such information, the Company receives from the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal an executed confidentiality agreement with terms not
less restrictive, with respect to confidentiality, to the other party than the
terms in the Confidentiality Agreement are on Parent; _provided_ , that the
Company shall not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person
subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from
providing any information to Parent in accordance with this _Section 6.2_ or
otherwise prohibits the Company from complying with its obligations under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not provide
information to any Person pursuant to any confidentiality agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement unless such Person agrees prior to
receipt of such information to waive any provision that would prohibit the
Company from

 



     

 

 



 

providing any information to Parent in accordance with this _Section 6.2_ or
otherwise prohibit the Company from complying with its obligations under this
Agreement; and

 



 

(iii) participate in discussions or negotiations with any such Person
regarding such Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

in each case, if, and only if, prior to taking any action described in clauses
(ii) or (iii) above, the Company Board determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel that (A) based on the information then
available and after consultation with its outside financial advisors, such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 



 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) give
written notice to Parent if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries receives
(i) any inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or offer with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request by any Person or group for information
in connection with or with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any
request by any Person or group for discussions or negotiations, or to initiate
or continue discussions or negotiations, with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, setting forth in such notice the name of such Person or group and
the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if
applicable, complete copies of any written request, inquiry, proposal,
indication of interest or offer) and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on
a reasonably current basis (and, in any event, within 24 hours), of the status
and material terms of any such proposals or offers (including any material
amendments thereto) and any material changes to the status of any such
discussions or negotiations, including any change in its intentions as
previously notified.

 



 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

" ** _Acquisition Proposal_** " means any proposal, indication of interest or
offer relating to (i) a merger, joint venture, partnership, collaboration,
consolidation, dissolution, liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization,
reorganization, spin-off, share exchange, business combination or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any
acquisition by any Person or group resulting in, or any proposal, indication
of interest or offer that in the case of either of the foregoing clauses (i)
or (ii), if consummated, would result in any Person or group becoming the
beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a series of related
transactions, 15% or more of the total voting power or of any class of equity
securities of the Company or those of any of its Subsidiaries or assets
representing 15% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net income or total
assets (including equity securities of any of the Companys Subsidiaries and
equity securities of any other entity) of the Company or (iii) any combination
of the foregoing, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

" ** _Superior Proposal_** " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a material breach of this Agreement or the Voting
Agreement that would result in any Person or group becoming the beneficial
owner of, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the

 



     

 

 



 

total voting power or of any class of equity securities of the Company or
assets representing more than 50% of the consolidated net revenues, net income
or total assets (including equity securities of the Companys Subsidiaries and
equity securities of any other entity) of the Company, that the Company Board
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and its outside financial advisor, taking into account all legal,
financial, financing and regulatory aspects of the Acquisition Proposal, the
identity of the Person(s) making the proposal and the likelihood of the
proposal being consummated in accordance with its terms, that, if consummated,
would result in a transaction that is more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (after taking into account any revisions to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Parent pursuant to _Section 6.2(f)_).

 



 

(e) _No Change of Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Except
as permitted by _Section 6.2(f)_ and _Section 6.2(g)_, the Company Board,
including any committee thereof, shall not:

 



 

(i) withhold or withdraw or fail to make when required by this Agreement (or
publicly propose or resolve to withhold or withdraw or fail to make when
required by this Agreement) the Company Recommendation with respect to the
Merger;

 



 

(ii) qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to qualify or modify)
the Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger in a manner adverse to
Parent;

 



 

(iii) approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable, any Acquisition
Proposal;

 



 

(iv) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement;

 



 

(v) if any Acquisition Proposal that is structured as a tender offer or
exchange offer for outstanding Shares is commenced pursuant to Rule 14d-2 of
the Exchange Act, fail to recommend against acceptance of such offer by the
Companys stockholders within ten Business Days following a request by Parent
or, if sooner, the Business Day prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting;

 



 

(vi) approve or recommend, or publicly declare advisable or publicly propose
to enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement, collaboration agreement or other
agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to _Section
6.2(b)_, in each case providing for an Acquisition Proposal (an " **
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_** ,"; the transaction(s) contemplated
thereby, an " ** _Alternative Transaction_** "); and any of the actions set
forth in the foregoing clauses (i) through (vi), a " ** _Change of
Recommendation_** ")); or

 



 

(vii) cause or permit the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the
Company Board may effect a Change of Recommendation if the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that (x) in the case that the Change of
Recommendation is not made in response to an Acquisition Proposal, that an
Intervening Event has occurred and the failure to take such action would be in
violation of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (y) in
the case that such Change of Recommendation is made in response to an
Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal and the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company Board shall not take any action set forth above unless and
until (1) the Company has given Parent written notice of its intention to take
such action three Business Days in advance, which notice shall comply with the
provisions of _Section 6.2(c)_ (if applicable), setting forth in writing that
management of the Company intends to recommend to the Company Board that it
take such action; (2) after giving such notice and prior to taking such
action, the Company has negotiated in good faith with Parent (to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate) to enable Parent to propose in writing a binding
offer to make such revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would
cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal (or,
in the case of a Change of Recommendation not involving an Acquisition
Proposal, that the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would not be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law); and (3) at the end of the three Business Day period and
prior to taking any such action, the Company Board has considered in good
faith any such binding offer to make revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent and any other information offered by Parent in response to
the notice, and has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel and its outside financial advisors, that in the case of a
Superior Proposal, the Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal (or, in the case of a Change of Recommendation not involving an
Acquisition Proposal, that the failure to effect a Change of Recommendation
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law) if such changes proposed in such binding offer by Parent were to be given
effect. In the event of any modification to the financial terms or any other
material terms of any Acquisition Proposal, the proviso in the immediately
preceding sentence shall apply again with references to "three Business Days"
being replaced with "two Business Days".

 



 

" ** _Intervening Event_** " means a change, effect, event, circumstance or
development that was not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company or
the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall any of the following constitute or be deemed to be an
Intervening Event: (i) the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition
Proposal or any matter arising therefrom; (ii) changes in the stock price of
the Company, as such, it being understood that, subject to the other
limitations set forth in this definition, one or more events underlying a
change in the Companys stock price may qualify as an Intervening Event; (iii)
any event, change or circumstance relating to Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates; (iv) the timing of any regulatory approvals or
other action by or in respect of any Governmental Authority; or (v) any
failure by the Company to meet any (or the publication of any report
regarding) projections, forecasts, budgets estimates or outlook of or relating
to the Company or its Subsidiaries, including with respect to revenues or
earnings or other internal or external financial or operating projections.

 



     

 

 



 

(g) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company, the Company Board or any committee of the Company Board
from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company that is required by applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such disclosure has the substantive effect of withholding
or withdrawing, adversely qualifying, modifying or failing to make when
required by this Agreement the Company Recommendation, such disclosure shall
be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and Parent shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement as set forth in _Section 8.1(g)_; it being
understood that a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be
a Change of Recommendation.

 



 

(h) _Existing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any discussions and negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or proposal or
transaction that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall within 24 hours after execution of this Agreement
deliver a written notice to each such Person providing only that the Company
is ending all discussions and negotiations with such Person with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal or proposal or transaction that could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall also request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information concerning
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries. The Company will immediately
terminate all physical and electronic data access previously granted to such
Persons.

 



 

(i) _Limits on Release of Standstill and Confidentiality_. During the period
commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing
until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article VIII_ and the Effective Time, the Company shall not terminate,
amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or
similar agreement entered into in connection with any Acquisition Proposal
proposed, discussed or negotiated on or prior to the date of this Agreement to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and shall enforce, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the provisions of any such
agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any breaches of such
agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall be permitted to terminate, amend, modify, waive or fail to
enforce any provision of any such confidentiality, "standstill" or similar
obligation of any Person (i) if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law or (ii) to the extent such provisions would prohibit any Person
or Group from making an Acquisition Proposal privately to the Company Board.

 



 

6.3. _Proxy Statement Filing; Information Supplied_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, as promptly as
practicable and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date
of this Agreement, a

 



     

 

 



 

proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the Company Shareholders
Meeting (such proxy statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto,
the " ** _Proxy Statement_** "). The Company shall promptly notify Parent of
the receipt of all comments from the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement
and of any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for
additional information and shall promptly provide to Parent copies of all
correspondence between the Company and/or any of its Representatives and the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all
comments received on the Proxy Statement from the SEC, and the Company shall
cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the
Company as promptly as practicable after the date the SEC staff advises (i)
that it has no further comments thereon or (ii) that the Company may commence
mailing the Proxy Statement. The Company agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that (i) the Proxy Statement will comply in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and (ii) none of the information supplied by it or any
of its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date of mailing to stockholders of the Company or at
the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent agrees that
none of the information supplied by it in writing specifically for inclusion
in the Proxy Statement will, at the date of mailing to stockholders of the
Company or at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



 

(b) The Company shall provide legal counsel to Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the Proxy Statement and any
other documents related to the Company Shareholders Meeting prior to filing
such documents with the applicable Governmental Authority and mailing such
documents to the Companys stockholders. The Company shall include in the
Proxy Statement and such other documents related to the Company Shareholders
Meeting all comments reasonably proposed by Parent or its legal counsel and
agrees that all information relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries included
in the Proxy Statement shall be in form and content reasonably satisfactory to
Parent. The foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.3(b)_ shall not apply to
any document relating to a Change of Recommendation.

 



 

6.4. _Company Shareholders Meeting_.

 



 

(a) The Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its Charter
and bylaws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of the holders of Shares
(the " ** _Company Shareholders Meeting_** ") as promptly as practicable after
the SEC confirms that it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement, to
consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement and to cause such vote
to be taken, and shall not postpone or adjourn such meeting, except to the
extent required by Law or pursuant to this _Section 6.4(a)_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn, recess,
or postpone, and at the request of Parent it shall adjourn, recess or
postpone, the Company Shareholders Meeting (i) for a reasonable period to
solicit additional proxies, if the Company or Parent, respectively,

 



     

 

 



 

reasonably believes there will be insufficient Shares represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Company Shareholders Meeting or to obtain the Requisite Company Vote (
_provided_ that, unless agreed in writing by the Company and Parent, all such
adjournments, recesses or postponements in the aggregate shall be for a period
of no more than twenty Business Days). In addition, the Company may adjourn,
recess or postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting (i) with the consent of
Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) if the
Company determines, in consultation with Parent, an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement is required by applicable Law (in which case the Company
Shareholders Meeting shall be adjourned to the extent necessary to ensure that
such required amendment or supplement is provided to the Companys
stockholders for the amount of time required by Law in advance of the Company
Shareholders Meeting) and (iii) to a date no later than the second Business
Day following the expiration of any three or two Business Day period following
written notice provided by the Company to Parent in accordance with the
proviso of _Section 6.2(f)_ regarding an intent to make a Change of
Recommendation. Subject to _Section 6.2(f)_, the Company Board shall include
the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and shall take all lawful
action to obtain the Requisite Company Vote.

 



 

(b) The Company agrees (i) to use reasonable best efforts to provide Parent
reasonably detailed periodic updates concerning proxy solicitation results on
a timely basis (including, if requested, promptly providing daily voting
reports) and (ii) to give written notice to Parent one Business Day prior to
the Company Shareholders Meeting and on the day of, but prior to, the Company
Shareholders Meeting, indicating whether as of such date sufficient proxies
representing the Requisite Company Vote have been obtained.

thereby, including the Merger; (iii) defend any lawsuits or other proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the

respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement required under the
Exchange Act, any other applicable federal or state securities Laws, the HSR
Act, any applicable Antitrust Laws, and any other applicable Law. Parent shall
pay all filing fees required under the HSR Act or any applicable Antitrust
Laws.

 



      

 

 



 

(b) The parties shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to
give, and in the case of the Company, will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each Joint Venture Entity to give) any notices to third parties, and
shall use, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, reasonable
best efforts to obtain any third-party consents that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the parties shall coordinate and cooperate in
determining whether any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required
to be obtained from parties to any Contracts of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or
waivers.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
6.5_, each party shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of the making
or commencement of any request or proceeding by or before any Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Voting Agreement; (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of
any such request or proceeding; and (iii) promptly inform the other parties of

consistent with its obligations under this _Section 6.5_; _provided_ that
Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance and, to the
extent reasonably practicable, each will consult with the other on and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Voting Agreement. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any
Governmental Authority or by any applicable Law, in connection with any such

and be consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Authority in connection with such request or
proceeding.

 



 

(d) In furtherance of the covenants set forth in this _Section 6.5 _and
subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 6.5(d)_, if any
objections are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Voting Agreement under the HSR Act, any applicable Antitrust
Laws or any other applicable Law or if any lawsuit or other proceeding,
whether judicial or administrative, is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any
other Governmental Authority challenging the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Voting Agreement or which would otherwise prohibit or
materially impair or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use their respective reasonable best efforts to resolve any
such objections or lawsuits or other proceedings (or threatened lawsuits or
other proceedings) so as to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting Agreement as soon as reasonably
practicable; _provided_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained

 



     

 

 



 

in this _Section 6.5_, nothing in this Agreement or the Voting Agreement
shall require, or be construed to require, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or other Affiliates, in order to resolve any such objections or lawsuits or
other proceedings (or threatened lawsuits or other proceedings) or otherwise,
to (i)(A) sell, lease, license, transfer, dispose of, divest or otherwise
encumber, or hold separate pending any such action, or (B) propose, negotiate
or offer to effect, or consent or commit to, any such sale, leasing,

the Company or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or other Affiliates), or (ii) take or agree to take any other
action or agree or consent to any limitations or restrictions on freedom of
actions with respect to, or its ability to retain, or make changes in, any

of their respective Subsidiaries or other Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent can compel the Company to take any of the actions referred to
above (or agree to take such actions) if such actions are effective only after
the Effective Time and the Company may not take any of the actions referred to
above in connection with the matters contemplated by this _Section 6.5_
without the written consent of Parent.

 



 

6.6. _Information; Access and Reports_.

 



 

(a) Subject to applicable Law and the other provisions of this _Section 6.6_
and solely for purposes of furthering the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby or integration planning relating thereto, (i) the Company
and Parent each shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, upon reasonable
request by the other, furnish the other with reasonable information in its
possession concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or any other statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement, (ii) the Company shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, upon the giving by Parent of notice to
the Company at least 24 hours in advance, afford Parents officers and other
authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its officers, employees,
agents, contracts, books and records, stores, offices, distribution facilities
and other facilities, _provided_ that any such access shall be conducted under
the supervision of personnel of the Company and in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the Company, and, during
such period, the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to furnish to Parent
reasonable information in its possession concerning its business, properties
and personnel as may reasonably be requested by Parent, and (iii) the Company
shall continue to provide access to Parent and its Representatives to the Data
Room.

 



 

(b) The foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.6_ shall not require either
the Company or Parent to permit any access to any of its officers, employees,
agents, contracts, books or records, or its stores, offices, distribution
facilities or other facilities, or to permit any inspection, review, sampling
or audit, or to disclose or otherwise make available any information,
documents or materials that (x) in the reasonable judgment of the Company or

 



     

 

 



 

Parent, would result in the violation of Law or the disclosure of any trade
secrets of any third parties or violate the terms of any confidentiality
provisions in any agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement or (y) is subject to attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine or similar privilege or (z) relates to the Company Boards
consideration of this Agreement or alternatives thereto. In the event that
Parent or the Company objects to any request submitted pursuant to and in
accordance with this _Section 6.6_ and withholds information on the basis of
the foregoing sentence, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall promptly
inform the other party as to the general nature of what is being withheld and
the Company and Parent shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure as promptly as reasonably practicable that does not suffer from any
of the foregoing impediments, including through the use of commercially
reasonable efforts to (A) obtain the required consent or waiver of any third
party required to provide such information and/or (B) implement appropriate
and mutually agreeable measures to permit the disclosure of such information
in a manner to remove the basis for the objection, including by entering into
a common interest or joint defense or similar agreement in form and substance
to be reasonably agreed among the parties or the arrangement of appropriate
clean room procedures or redaction of text from documents. Each of Parent and
the Company, as it deems advisable and necessary, may reasonably designate
competitively sensitive material provided to the other as "Outside Counsel
Only Material" or with similar restrictions. All information exchanged or made
available shall be governed by the terms of the confidentiality and non-
disclosure agreement, dated as of July 23, 2018, between Parent and the
Company, as modified by the letter agreement, dated November 23, 2018,
regarding the authorization to propose a potential transaction (as it may be
further amended from time to time, the " ** _Confidentiality Agreement_** ").

 



 

(c) No exchange of information or investigation by Parent or its
Representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall affect or be deemed to
affect, modify or waive the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in this Agreement, and no investigation by the Company or its
Representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall affect or be deemed to
affect, modify or waive the representations and warranties of Parent or Merger
Sub set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, neither the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 6.6_ nor any other provision of this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to limit any customary disclosure
(subject to customary confidentiality restrictions, including customary
"click-through" confidentiality agreements, as applicable) made by Parent,
Merger Sub and their Affiliates and/or Representatives to the Financing
Sources, rating agencies, or otherwise in connection with efforts or
activities by Parent and Merger Sub to obtain the Debt Financing.

 



 

6.7. _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and
policies of NASDAQ to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act
as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more
than

 



     

 

 



 

ten days after the Closing Date. If the Surviving Corporation is reasonably
likely to be required to file any reports pursuant to the Exchange Act during
the ten days after the Effective Time, the Company will deliver to Parent at
least five Business Days prior to the Effective Time a substantially final
draft of any such report reasonably likely to be filed during such period and
fully executed officer certifications required to be filed with such reports.

 



 

6.8. _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release of Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the Company
nor Parent, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries, shall issue any press
release or make any other public announcement or public statement (to the
extent not previously publicly disclosed or made in accordance with this
Agreement) with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Company (in the case
of a press release or public announcement by Parent or its Subsidiaries) or
Parent (in the case of a public announcement by the Company or its
Subsidiaries) (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except (i) as such press release or other public announcement may be
required by applicable Law, in which case the party required to or whose
Subsidiary is required to issue the release or make such public announcement
shall use reasonable best efforts to provide the other party with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such release or announcement in advance
of its issuance and shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
such comments proposed by the other party or (ii) in connection with a Change
of Recommendation, if and to the extent permitted by the terms of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.8_,
each of the parties may make public statements in response to specific
questions by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as any such
statements are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and the Company and do
not reveal material, non-public information regarding the other parties or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to applicable Law
and the rules and policies of NASDAQ, the parties agree to use reasonable best
efforts to coordinate communications regarding this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby with customers, suppliers,
employees, shareholders and the community in general in accordance with the
joint communications plan set forth in _Schedule 6.8_.

 



 

6.9. _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on December 31, 2019, each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries
who continues to be employed after the Effective Time (the " ** _Continuing
Employees_** "), including any such Continuing Employee on an approved leave
of absence (including without limitation short-term disability leave), will be
provided with (i) a base salary or base wage that is substantially comparable
in the aggregate to the base salary or base wage provided by the Company and
its Subsidiaries to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) target short-term cash bonus opportunities that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate as the target short-term cash bonus
opportunities provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) retirement and
welfare benefits (excluding equity and long-term incentive compensation and

 



     

 

 



 

defined benefit pension benefits) that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause any pre-
existing conditions or limitations and eligibility waiting periods under any
group health plans of Parent or its Affiliates to be waived with respect to
the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents, (ii) give each
Continuing Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time
occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for
medical expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has
been made and (iii) give each Continuing Employee service credit for such
Continuing Employees employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries for
purposes of vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to participate under each
applicable Benefit Plan, as if such service had been performed with Parent
(except for benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans, for purposes
of qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or retiree medical
benefits or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits).

 



 

(c) If requested by Parent in writing no later than twenty (20) Business Days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Companys 401(k)
savings plan (the " ** _Company 401(k) Plan_**") to be terminated effective
the Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the effectiveness of such termination may be conditioned on
the occurrence of the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests that
the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with
evidence that such Plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which
shall be subject to review and approval by Parent) not later than the day
immediately preceding the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests
that the Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, and _provided_ that Parent has
first received a Favorable IRS determination letter regarding the Company
401(k) Plan, Parent shall cause its 401(k) plan (or the plan of an Affiliate)
to accept rollovers of outstanding balances and participant loans under the
Company 401(k) Plan as soon as administratively practicable after the Closing
Date.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement will
(i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates from amending or
terminating any of their benefit plans or, after the Effective Time, any
Benefit Plan, in each case in accordance with their terms, (iii) obligate
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates to retain the
employment of any particular employee or (iv) create any third party
beneficiary rights for the benefit of any employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective
bargaining representative thereof, with respect to this _Section 6.9_ or any
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any Continuing Employee by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Affiliates or under any benefit plan which Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates may maintain.

 



 

(e) Prior to making any written or oral communications to the directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pertaining to
compensation or

 



     

 

 



 

benefits that are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication,
Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the
communication, and the Company shall consider any such comments in good faith.

 



 

6.10. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 8.2(b)_, whether
or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of
this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including all fees and expenses of its Representatives, shall be
paid by the party incurring such expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, Parent shall bear and timely pay all filing fees associated with the
HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws.

 



 

6.11. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) After the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the individuals who on or prior to
the Effective Time were officers or directors of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or were serving at the request of the Company as an officer or
director of any other corporation, partnership or joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise with respect to all acts or
omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Effective Time to
the fullest extent that the Company or the Subsidiary for which they were
acting in such capacity would have been permitted to indemnify and hold
harmless such individuals by applicable Law (including with respect to
advancement of expenses).

 



 

(b) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to advancement of expenses,
exculpation or indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the
current and former directors and officers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their predecessors and the heirs, executors, trustees,
fiduciaries and administrators of such officer or director (each, a " ** _D andO
Indemnitee_**"), as provided in the Companys or each of its Subsidiaries
respective certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organizational or governing documents) or in any agreement, shall survive the
Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Voting
Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. After the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) fulfill and honor such
obligations to the maximum extent that the Company or applicable Subsidiary
would have been permitted to fulfill and honor them by applicable Law. In
addition, for a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar
organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to advancement of expenses, indemnification
and exculpation that are at least as favorable as the indemnification and
exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and during such six-year
period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise

 



     

 

 



 

modified in any respect, except as required by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for
the extension of (i) the directors and officers liability coverage of the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and (ii) the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case
providing for a claims reporting or discovery period of six years from and
after the Effective Time (the " ** _Tail Period_** ") from one or more
insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
insurance carrier as of the date of this Agreement with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, " ** _D andO Insurance_**"), for the persons who are
covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance as of the date of this
Agreement, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage that are
at least as favorable to such insured individuals as the Companys existing
DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement, the Voting
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby or thereby);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not pay, and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay (and the Parent shall not be required
to cause the Surviving Corporation to pay), as the case may be, for such Tail
Period aggregate one-time premium costs in excess of the amount set forth in
Section 6.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " ** _Premium Cap_**
"). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain
such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
continue to maintain in effect for the persons who are covered by the
Companys DandO Insurance existing as of the date of this Agreement for the Tail
Period such DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of
coverage that are at least as favorable to the insureds as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for the persons who are covered by the
Companys existing DandO Insurance for the Tail Period with terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage that are at least as favorable to the
insureds as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall be
not be required to pay (and the Parent shall not be required to cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay) for such Tail Period aggregate one-time premium
costs in excess of the Premium Cap and if the cost of such insurance coverage
exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain (and the Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain) a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.11_ shall survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each DandO Indemnitee,
and nothing in this Agreement or the Voting Agreement shall affect any
indemnification rights that any such DandO Indemnitee may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Contract or applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations under this _Section 6.11_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any DandO Indemnitee without the consent of such DandO Indemnitee.

 



     

 

 



 

(e) In the event that the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns) shall
consolidate or merge with any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or transfers
at least 50% of its properties and assets to any other Person, then in each
case proper provision shall be made so that the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns, if applicable), or
transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 6.11_.

 



 

6.12. _Resignations_. To the extent requested by Parent, the Company shall
cause each director or officer of the Company to resign in such capacity, with
such resignations to be effective as of the Effective Time.

 



 

6.13. _Shareholder Litigation_. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly
notify the other of any shareholder litigation against it or any of its
Representatives, in each case, arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
the Voting Agreement or the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
including the Merger, and shall keep the other reasonably informed regarding
any such shareholder litigation. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in on a regular basis, but not control or direct, the defense,
prosecution or settlement of any shareholder litigation against the Company,
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or officers (including
by providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto), (b) afford Parent
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on filings and responses
related thereto and (c) on a current basis, keep Parent apprised of, and
consult with Parent with respect to, proposed strategy and any significant
decisions related thereto. In no event shall the Company settle or offer,
compromise or agree to settle or compromise, or take any other action to
settle, compromise or moot, any shareholder litigation without Parents prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

 



 

6.14. _Other Actions by the Company_.

 



 

(a) _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Voting Agreement, the Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals
and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute or regulation on such transactions.

 



 

(b) _Section 16 Matters_. The Company and the Company Board (or a duly formed
committee thereof consisting of non-employee directors (as such term is
defined for the purposes of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act)),
shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all such actions as may be necessary
or appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by any individual who is subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law.

 



     

 

 



 

6.15. _Approval of Sole Shareholder of Merger Sub_. Immediately following
execution of this Agreement, Parent (directly or through its Subsidiaries)
shall cause the sole shareholder of Merger Sub to execute and deliver, in
accordance with applicable Law and its certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, a written consent approving the plan of merger contained in this
Agreement and thereafter, (i) Parent shall give prompt written notice of such
consent to the Company and (ii) neither Parent nor its Subsidiaries shall
amend, modify or withdraw such consent.

 



 

6.16. _Treatment of Company Indebtedness_. Upon request of Parent, the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take any
actions reasonably requested by Parent that are necessary to facilitate the
payoff by Parent of the indebtedness pursuant to (a) the Fifth Amended and
Restated Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of October 24, 2017, by and

(i) the amount that must be paid in satisfaction or discharge of the
applicable indebtedness, (ii) wire instructions for payment and (iii)
assurances that upon payment of the amounts specified therein, all outstanding
indebtedness, liabilities or other obligations of the Company and its

6.17. _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall use (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use) its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange and consummate the Financing on the

 



     

 

 



 

terms described in the Commitment Letter or on such other terms that are
acceptable to Parent (to the extent in compliance with _Section 6.17(b)_),
including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to Parent set forth in the Commitment Letter
that are within its control, (ii) maintain in effect the Commitment Letter or
definitive agreements with respect thereto, (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Commitment Letter on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter or on such other terms that
are acceptable to Parent (to the extent in compliance with _Section 6.17(b)_)
and enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter and (iv) consummate the
Financing at or prior to the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that if funds
in the amounts and on the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter become
unavailable to Parent, Parent shall use (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to use) commercially reasonable efforts to obtain alternative
debt financing (the " ** _Alternative Financing_** ") in amounts and otherwise
on terms and conditions no less favorable in the aggregate to Parent than as
set forth in the Commitment Letter or on such other terms that are acceptable
to Parent (to the extent in compliance with _Section 6.17(b)_); _provided_ ,
that if Parent proceeds with Alternative Financing, it shall be subject to the
same obligations as set forth in this _Section 6.17_ with respect to the
Financing. Parent shall promptly notify the Company of (i) the expiration or
termination (or attempted or purported termination, whether or not valid) of
the Commitment Letter, (ii) any refusal by the Lender to provide or any stated
intent by the Lender to refuse to provide the full financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letter, (iii) any breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any Financing
Source party to the Commitment Letter or definitive document related to the
Financing of which Parent becomes aware or (iv) receipt of any written notice
or other written communication from the Lender with respect to any actual or
potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Financing;
_provided_ that in no event will Parent be under any obligation to disclose
any information that is subject to attorney client or similar privilege if
Parent shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to disclose such
information in a way that would not waive such privilege. Parent shall not
replace, amend or waive the Commitment Letter (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any provision of any Fee Letter) without the Companys prior written
consent if such replacement, amendment or waiver (i) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Financing below the amount required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) imposes new or additional
conditions, or otherwise expands any of the conditions, to the receipt of
Financing in a manner that would (A) reasonably be expected to delay or
prevent the Closing or (B) adversely impact in any respect the ability of
Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby ( _provided_ , that, for
the avoidance of doubt, Parent may replace or amend the Commitment Letter and
the Fee Letters solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the Commitment
Letter as of the date hereof). Parent shall provide to the Company copies of
any commitment letter and fee letters (it being understood that any such fee
letter provided to the Company shall be redacted in a customary manner solely
with respect to the fees, pricing caps and certain economic terms (including
economic flex terms)) associated with a replacement Financing or Alternative
Financing as well as any amendment or waiver of any commitment letter
(including the Commitment Letter) or fee letter (it being understood that any
such amendment or waiver of any fee letter provided to the Company shall be
redacted in a customary

 



     

 

 



 

manner solely with respect to the fees, pricing caps and certain economic
terms (including economic flex terms)) that is permitted hereunder.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Parent, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the respective Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide
to Parent all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
the arrangement of any debt financing to be consummated in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " ** _Debt Financing_** "),
including, without limitation, the following:

 



 

(i) furnishing Parent and the Financing Sources the financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably

(i), the " ** _Required Information_** "); provided that the Required
Information shall include (A) the unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and related unaudited condensed consolidated statements
of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows of the Company for each
fiscal quarter (other than the fourth fiscal quarter in any fiscal year) that
shall have ended after March 31, 2019 and at least 45 days prior to the
Closing Date and (B) to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, and to the
extent reasonably available and determinable in the Companys historical books
and records, information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries as
is reasonably necessary for Parent to prepare pro forma consolidated financial
statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) (it being understood that Parent shall be responsible for the
preparation of such pro forma financial statements, including any pro forma
adjustments related to the Debt Financing or any actions to be taken on or
after the Closing Date and such cooperation by the Company and its
Subsidiaries under this clause (B) shall relate solely to the financial
information derived from the historical books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries);

 



 

(ii) participation by management of an appropriate level in a reasonable
number of meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with the parties
acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and prospective lenders and purchasers
of, the Debt Financing and the applicable management and representatives of
the Company), presentations, drafting sessions and sessions with rating
agencies in connection with the Debt Financing (including assisting Parent in
obtaining ratings as contemplated by the Debt Financing);

 



 

(iii) providing Required Information for use in the preparation of materials
for rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda and similar

indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the release of

 



     

 

 



 

related liens, including customary payoff letters, and (C) agreements,
documents or certificates that facilitate the creation and perfection of liens
securing the Debt Financing as reasonably requested by Parent or the Financing
Sources; _provided_ , that no obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any such document, agreement or pledge shall be effective
until the Closing (other than any authorization letter provided pursuant to
clause (A) above);

 



 

(v) if reasonably requested in writing at least ten days prior to Closing,
providing at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, all
documentation and other information required by regulatory authorities under
applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the Proceeds of Crime Act and the Patriot Act
(including a certificate regarding beneficial ownership required by 31 C.F.R.
§1010.230);

 



 

(vi) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and the
Financing Sources for all or any portion of the Debt Financing;

 



 

(vii) permitting the Debt Financing Sources to evaluate and assess the assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements and determining collateral values, to the extent customary and
reasonable; and

 



 

(viii) using commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the due
diligence investigation of the Financing Sources, to the extent customary and
reasonable and not unreasonably interfering with the business of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries;

 



 

 _provided_ that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent
it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company
or its Subsidiaries; and _provided_ , _further_ , that neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives shall (1) be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other cost or

approve or authorize the execution of the Debt Financing (other than any
continuing officers or directors that will remain after the Closing Date), (2)
have any liability or obligation under any loan agreement and related
documents (other than, subject to _Section 6.17(c)_ below, with respect to
the Company in connection with authorization letters provided pursuant to

be under any obligation to disclose any information that is subject to
attorney-client or similar privilege if the Company shall have used its
commercially reasonable efforts to disclose such information in a way that
would not waive such privilege, or (4) be required to take any action that
will conflict with or violate any Laws or result in the default under any
material Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

 



 

(c) If the Closing does not occur, Parent shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs (including reasonable and documented attorneys fees and expenses)
incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation
described above in _Section 6.17(b)_. Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all liabilities or losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any
information utilized in

 



     

 

 



 

connection therewith, in each case, except to the extent such liabilities or
losses are suffered or incurred directly as a result of the bad faith, gross
negligence, or willful misconduct by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or, in each case, their respective Representatives.

 



 

(d) The Company hereby consents to the use of the logos of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Debt Financing and authorizes the
Financing Sources to download copies of such logos from its website for such
purposes; _provided_ , that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and its or their marks.

 



 

(e) Parent acknowledges and agrees that obtaining the Debt Financing is not a
condition to the Closing.

reasonably cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
Taxes of the Company, as well as any transfer, sales, use, recording,
registration and any similar Taxes of the Company incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall be responsible
for the payment of all such Taxes incurred by the Company, and the parties
shall reasonably cooperate in minimizing the amount of such Taxes.

abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

 



 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by November 20, 2019 (the " ** _Outside Date_** "), _provided_
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(b)_
shall not be available to any party that has breached in any material respect
its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have proximately
contributed to the occurrence of the failure of a condition to the
consummation of the Merger;

 



 

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if the Requisite Company Vote shall not
have been obtained upon a vote taken thereon at the Company Shareholders
Meeting (as such meeting may have been adjourned or postponed);

 



 

(d) by either Parent or the Company, if any court or other Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any Law permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and such Law shall have become final and non-
appealable;

 



 

(e) by Parent, if there has been a breach by the Company of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement,
or if any representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue,
in either case such that any condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_,
_Section 7.2(b)_ or _Section 7.2(c)_ would not be satisfied (and such breach
or failure to be true and correct is not curable prior to the Outside Date, or
if curable prior to the Outside Date, has not been cured within the earlier of
(i) 30 calendar days after the giving of notice thereof by Parent to the
Company or (ii) three Business Days prior to the Outside Date); _provided_
that neither Parent nor Merger Sub is then in breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement (except where such

 



     

 

 



 

breach by Parent or Merger Sub would not cause any of the conditions set forth
in _Section 7.3(a)_, _Section 7.3(b)_ or _Section 7.3(c)_ not to be
satisfied);

 



 

(f) by the Company, if there has been a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any

or if any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub shall have become
untrue, in either case such that any condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_

breaching party or (ii) three Business Days prior to the Outside Date);
_provided_ that the Company is not then in breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement (except where such breach

(g) by Parent, prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if a

Company pays the Company Termination Fee due.

 



 

8.2. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_

 



 

(a) Except to the extent provided in _Section 9.1_, in the event of
termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger in accordance
with _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no
liability to any Person on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its
Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , that (x), subject to
_Section 8.2(e)_, no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any
liability or damages to the other party hereto resulting from any willful and
material breach (as defined in _Section 9.8_) of this Agreement and (y) the
provisions set forth in this _Section 8.2_ and _Article IX_ shall survive
the termination of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that
nothing in this _Section 8.2(a)_ shall be deemed to affect their right to
specific performance under _Section 9.5(b)_.

 



 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) by (I) either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ (
_Outside Date_ ) or _Section 8.1(c)_ ( _Requisite Company Vote Not Obtained_
) or (II) Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ ( _Company Breach_ ), in each
such case:

 



 

(A) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any Person shall have publicly announced an
intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal that
has not been fully withdrawn without qualification prior to the earlier of (x)
five days prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting or (y) termination of this
Agreement; and

 



     

 

 



 

(B) within 12 months after such termination, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall have entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal is
subsequently consummated; _provided_ that, for purposes of this _Section
8.2(b)(i)_, the references to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to "50%";

 



 

(ii) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ ( _Company Recommendation
Matters_ ); or

 



 

(iii) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ ( _Superior Proposal_ );

 



 

then, (1) in the case of _Section 8.2(b)(i)_, within two Business Days after
consummation of such Acquisition Proposal, (2) in the case of _Section
8.2(b)(ii)_, within two Business Days after termination of this Agreement and
(3) in the case of _Section 8.2(b)(iii)_, concurrently with or prior to
termination of this Agreement, the Company shall pay a termination fee of
$16.6 million (the " ** _Company Termination Fee_** ") to Parent by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
Parent.

 



 

(c) Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, no party would have entered into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay Parent any amount
due pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ (any such amount due, a " ** _Termination
Payment_** "), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit
that results in a judgment against the Company for the applicable Termination
Payment, or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together
with interest thereon at the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ (or if not reported thereby, as reported in another authoritative
source reasonably selected by Parent) in effect on the date such Termination
Payment was required to be paid from such date through the date of full
payment thereof.

 



 

(d) Each of the parties acknowledges that the Company Termination Fee is not
intended to be a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such Company
Termination Fee is due and payable, for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this
Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which amount would otherwise be impossible to
calculate with precision. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the
Company Termination Fee, if paid to Parent, shall be treated as liquidated
damages that are capital in nature to which Section 1234A of the Code applies.

 



 

(e) No more than one Company Termination Fee may be payable under this
_Article VIII_. Parent (for itself and its affiliates) hereby agrees that,
upon any termination of this Agreement under circumstances in which Parent is
entitled to the Company Termination Fee under _Section 8.2_, Parent and its
Affiliates are precluded from any other remedy (other than any costs and
expenses that may become payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_) against the
Company, at law or in equity or otherwise, and neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates may seek (and Parent

 



     

 

 



 

will cause its Affiliates not to seek) to obtain any recovery, judgment, or
damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages,
against the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any of their
respective Representatives, partners, managers, members, or shareholders in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.

whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ that (x) after the receipt of
the Requisite Company Vote, no amendment shall be made which by applicable Law
requires further approval by the holders of Shares without first obtaining
such further approval and (y) no provision with respect to which any Financing
Source is a third party beneficiary hereunder shall be amended, modified,
discharged or waived in a manner materially adverse to such Financing Source
without its prior written consent. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "

to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are for the sole benefit of such party and may be waived by such
party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by applicable Law. No
failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Law (except to the extent specifically provided otherwise
in _Section 8.2_).

delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 



 

9.5. _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial; Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO
THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION.
Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees that it shall bring any
action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising under or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement exclusively in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not
have jurisdiction, another federal or state court located in the State of
Delaware (the " ** _Chosen Courts_** ") and, solely in connection with such
claims, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen
Courts, (ii) waives any objection to the laying of venue in any such action or
proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen
Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party to
this Agreement and (iv) agrees that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in
_Section 9.6_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be
valid and sufficient service thereof. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY SUCH
ACTION INVOLVING THE FINANCING SOURCES) IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND CERTIFIES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.5_.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that the
rights of each party to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are special, unique and of extraordinary
character and that if for any reason any of the provisions of this Agreement
are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise
breached, immediate and irreparable harm or damage would be caused for which

 



     

 

 



 

money damages would not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each party agrees
that, in addition to any other available remedies a party may have at law or
in equity, each party shall be entitled to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement and to obtain an injunction restraining any
breach or violation or threatened breach or violation of the provisions of
this Agreement without necessity of posting a bond or other form of security.
In the event that any action or proceeding should be brought in equity to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege or assert, and
each party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
(on behalf of itself and on behalf of each of its Subsidiaries) and Parent
agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and appellate courts thereof).

 



 

9.6. _Notices_. All notices, requests, instructions or other communications or
documents to be given or made hereunder by any party to the other parties to

failure to provide a copy to outside counsel does not alter the effectiveness

accordance with this _Section 9.6_.

 



 

9.7. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any exhibits, annexes and
schedules hereto) and the documents and other agreements among the parties
hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company
Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule, together with each
other agreement entered into by or among any of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company as of the date of this Agreement that makes reference to this _Section
9.7_, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all other prior agreements,
understandings, representations and warranties, both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Voting Agreement.

 



 

9.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section 6.11_ (
_Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_), _Section 6.17(b)_ (
_Financing_ ), this _Section 9.8_, _Section 9.15_ ( _Non-Recourse of Other
Persons_ ) and _Article IV_ (following the Effective Time) and the Companys
right, on behalf of the holders of Shares, to pursue equitable relief or
damages for Parents or Merger Subs willful and material breach of this
Agreement, which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger
Sub (provided, that this clause is not intended to, and under no circumstances
shall this Agreement be construed to, create any right of the holders of
Shares to bring an action directly against Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to
this Agreement (other than pursuant to Article IV following the Effective
Time),

 



     

 

 



 

only, Parent and the Company hereby agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other parties hereto, in accordance with and subject to the
terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not,
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein; _provided_ that the Financing Sources shall be express third
party beneficiaries of clause (y) of the proviso in _Section 9.2_, _Section
9.5(a)_, _Section 9.5(c)_, this _Section 9.8_ and _Section 9.14_. The
parties hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries
under _Section 6.11_ shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time
occurs. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful and material breach" means a
breach that is a consequence of an act deliberately taken by the breaching
party, or the deliberate failure by the breaching party to take an act it is
required to take under this Agreement, in each case with actual knowledge that
the taking of, or the failure to take, such act would, or would be reasonably
expected to, cause a material breach of this Agreement; _provided_ , that any
failure of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger in breach of this
Agreement will be deemed to be a willful and material breach by Parent and
Merger Sub (whether or not Parent or Merger Sub had sufficient funds).

 



 

9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Any obligation of
one party to another party under this Agreement, which obligation is
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by an Affiliate of such party, shall be
deemed to have been performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

 



 

9.10. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in _Annex A_ is defined in
the Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

 



 

9.11. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

9.12. _Interpretation; Construction_.

 



 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section or

 



     

 

 



 

Exhibit, such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated.

 



 

(b) If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it shall have
a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such as a verb).
Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise, words
importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neutral genders
and vice versa, and the definitions of terms contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. The
words "includes" or "including" shall mean "including without limitation," the
words "hereof," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and similar terms in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular
section or article in which such words appear and any reference to a Law shall
include any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any reference to
any Law in this Agreement shall mean such Law as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented. Currency amounts referenced herein are in U.S.
Dollars. Each reference to a "wholly-owned Subsidiary" or "wholly-owned
Subsidiaries" of a Person shall be deemed to include any Subsidiary of such
Person where all of the equity interests of such Subsidiary are directly or
indirectly owned by such Person (other than directors qualifying shares,
nominee shares or other equity interests that are required by law or
regulation to be held by a director or nominee).

 



 

(c) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

9.13. _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign
any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, by
operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other
parties, except that Merger Sub may assign any and all of its rights under
this Agreement, by written notice to the Company, to another wholly-owned
direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent to be a Constituent Corporation in
lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references to Merger Sub in this
Agreement shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except that all
representations and warranties made in this Agreement with respect to Merger
Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and
warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such
designation; _provided_ that no assignment shall relieve Parent of any of its
obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Any purported assignment in violation
of this Agreement is void.

 



 

9.14. _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Financing Sources (in their capacity as such) shall not have
any liability to the Company or any of its equity holders, representatives or
Affiliates (in each case, with respect to such equity holders, representatives
or Affiliates, prior to the Closing) relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract or in tort or otherwise, and
the Company and its equity

 



     

 

 



 

holders, representatives and Affiliates (in each case, with respect to such
equity holders, representatives or Affiliates, prior to the Closing) shall not
have any rights or claims, and shall not seek any loss or damage or any other
recovery or judgment of any kind, including direct, indirect, consequential,
special, exemplary or punitive damages, against any Financing Source (in its
capacity as such) under this Agreement or the Debt Financing, whether at law
or equity, in contract or in tort or otherwise; _provided_ that nothing in
this _Section 9.14_ shall limit the liability or obligations of the Financing
Sources to Parent (and its successors and assigns) under the commitment
letters relating to the Debt Financing (or any fee letters referred to therein
or definitive financing agreements with respect to the Debt Financing).

 



 

9.15. _Non-Recourse of Other Persons_. This Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may only be
brought against, the Persons that are expressly named as parties to this
Agreement and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth
herein with respect to each such party. Except to the extent a named party to
this Agreement, no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
advisor or representative or Affiliate of any of the foregoing shall have any
liability (whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise) for any one or more
of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations
or liabilities of any one or more of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub under
this Agreement or for any claim based on, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
