at least two business days before Closing.

Accountant, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the
Independent Accountant at the time the determination of the Independent
Accountant is rendered on the Closing Balance Sheet. The Independent
Accountant shall resolve the computation or verification of the disputed
Closing Balance Sheet entries in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement and otherwise where applicable in accordance with GAAP. If any
matters have been submitted to the Independent Accountant for review and
resolution in accordance with the provisions above, then Sellers and Buyer
shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Independent
Accountant to complete its preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet within 30
days from the submission of the matters specified in such Notice of
Disagreement. The Independent Accountant shall act as a neutral arbitrator to
determine only those issues in dispute. The Independent Accountants
determination will be set forth in a written statement delivered to Buyer and
Sellers, and shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties.

approved by Sellers among the Assets and the Non-Competition and Non-
Solicitation Agreements contemplated by Section 8.6(b) consistent with the
provisions of section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder. If a Party disagrees with respect to any material item included
in the proposed allocation, then the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve the issue. If they cannot resolve the issue within 30 days, it shall
be resolved by an accounting or appraisal firm chosen by and mutually
acceptable to all Parties. The costs, fees, and expenses of such firm shall be
born equally by Buyer and Sellers. Neither Buyer nor Sellers, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, shall take any position on a Tax Return or
audit inconsistent with such allocation unless required to do so by
applicable law. Buyer and Sellers shall each provide to the other for review a
copy of its report with respect to this transaction pursuant to section 1060
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder at least ten business
days prior to submission to the Internal Revenue Service.

3.17. _Permits and Licenses_. Sellers possess all consents, licenses,

result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, neither Seller,
and to the Knowledge of Sellers no other party, is in material breach or

may be conducted.



(c) Each Employee Pension Benefit Plan meets the requirements of a qualified
plan under section 401(a) of the Code and has received (or is entitled to
rely on in accordance with applicable IRS guidelines) a favorable
determination or opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service reflecting
compliance with all applicable legislation enacted on or before December 31,
2005. No Employee Pension Benefit Plan is maintained that is not a qualified
plan under section 401(a) of the Code, nor are any current liabilities
reflected in Working Capital for any such non-qualified Employee Pension

of the assets of any Employee Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for

or investigation. No Party in Interest has any interest in any assets of any
Employee Pension Benefit Plan other than as a beneficiary by virtue of such
Persons participation in such plan.

been completely or partially terminated or the subject of a Reportable Event
and no proceeding by the PBGC to terminate any Employee Pension Benefit Plan

any withdrawal liability) or under the Code with respect to any Employee
Pension Benefit Plan.



(g) Neither Sellers, any of its Affiliates, nor any member of its Controlled

insured (except for applicable deductibles) and no insurer has issued
a "reservation of rights" letter or otherwise qualified its obligation to
insure and defend Sellers against losses arising therefrom. There are no
claims, actions, suits, litigation, arbitration, mediations, investigations or
other proceedings pending, affecting or to Sellers Knowledge threatened
against Sellers with respect to the Business or the Assets that would
prohibit, delay or otherwise restrict the transactions contemplated herein,

three complete fiscal years of each Seller and for the current year-to-date,
and indicates those Tax Returns that have been audited and those that
currently are the subject of audit or that have not been audited.

with respect to Taxes of either Seller, and no material reassessments (for
property or ad valorem Tax purposes) of any assets or any property owned or
leased by Sellers have been proposed.

(pursuant to section 168(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as in
effect after the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, and before the Tax Reform
Act of 1986) or is "tax-exempt use property" (within the meaning of section

reduce the volume of business transacted with Sellers below historical

(b) Nothing contained in this Section 10.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall be deemed to limit or otherwise affect in any manner the right of Buyer
or any Affiliate of Buyer to terminate at will the employment of any Hired
Employee (except as otherwise provided in Assumed Contracts with
such employees), or limit the right of Buyer or any Affiliate to apply its
existing personnel policies and procedures to the Hired Employees. Nothing
contained in this Section 10.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed
to limit or otherwise affect in any manner the right of Buyer or any
Affiliate of Buyer to make changes to the Employee Benefit Plans offered to
the Hired Employees so long as any such changes are the same in all material
respects as those made with respect to all other similarly situated employees
covered by the affected Employee Benefit Plans.



(c) Buyer shall not assume Sellers obligations or liabilities under any
Employee Benefit Plan or Other Plan except to the extent included in the
Assumed Liabilities.



(d) With respect to the Hired Employees and their eligible dependents, Parent
will cause Buyer to waive the "pre-existing condition" exclusions under
Buyers applicable Employee Welfare Benefit Plans offered to the Hired
Employees to the extent permissible under the terms thereof and applicable
law, subject to any pre-existing condition limitations provided by Sellers
Employee Welfare Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date. Buyer shall give all
Hired Employees credit for their accrued but unused vacation, holiday and sick
pay (whether in such form or in the forms of so-called paid time off or
extended illness bank plans) to the extent the same constitute Assumed
Liabilities. Sellers shall provide Parent with a complete and accurate list of
such accrued but unused vacation, holiday and sick pay. Buyer shall give all
Hired Employees credit after Closing for their years of service with Sellers
as provided by Sellers to the Parent for the purpose of determining how much
vacation, holiday and sick pay the Hired Employees are entitled to under the
applicable Employee Welfare Benefit Plan of



 

45 Buyer (subject to appropriate offset for any vacation, holiday or sick pay
that constitute Assumed Liabilities) and for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate and vesting percentages in the Employee Pension
Benefit Plans offered to the Hired Employees (but not for purposes of benefit
accrual or entitlement to any retirement, early retirement or subsidized
benefits based on service). Buyer will not assume or otherwise become liable
for (i) long-term disability payments to any Employee or former Employee of
Sellers who does not actively work for Buyer after Closing, or (ii) other
obligations to former or currently retired employees of Sellers, except as
provided in Section 10.1(f).



(e) To the extent permissible under the terms thereof and applicable law,
Buyer shall credit the Hired Employees and their eligible dependents under
the Employee Welfare Benefit Plans offered to the Hired Employees with any
deductibles, copayments or other cost-sharing amounts incurred by the Hired
Employee or eligible dependent under Sellers Employee Welfare Benefit
Plans during the period beginning on the first day of the most recent plan
year of the applicable Employee Welfare Benefit Plan offered by Buyer to Hired
Employees and ending on the Closing Date as provided by the Sellers to Parent.



(f) At Closing or at such later date as may be agreed upon by Sellers and
Buyer, Sellers will cease to provide any group health plan (as defined in Code
Section 5000(b)(1)) to any Employee of Sellers. With respect to all group
health plans maintained by Sellers prior to the Closing, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that Buyer will be a "successor employer" to Sellers
in connection with the asset sale for purposes of the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (as amended, " _COBRA_ "), as described in
Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9 QandA-8(c)(1). In furtherance thereof,
one or more of the group health plans maintained by Buyer will have the
obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to "M and A
Qualified Beneficiaries" with respect to the asset sale (as described in
Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9 QandA-4(a)), beginning on the later of
(i) the Closing Date or (ii) the date Sellers ceases to provide any group
health plan to any employee, as such coverage is required under Code Section
4980B(f) and as set forth in Treasury Regulation Sections 54.4980B-1 through
54.4980B-10, relating to all group health plans maintained by Sellers prior to
the Closing Date. Seller shall provide Parent with a complete and accurate
list of all such MandA Qualified Beneficiaries.



10.2. _Hired Employees_. As soon as practicable after Closing, Sellers shall
provide Buyer with all necessary payroll records for the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs so that Buyer may furnish a Form W-2 to all Hired
Employees disclosing all wages and other compensation paid to them (and
amounts withheld therefrom) by Sellers and Buyer in the calendar year. Sellers
will take all steps necessary to enable Buyer to comply with the requirements
of the alternate procedure of Rev. Proc. 96-60, 1996-2 C.B. 399. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that any Hired Employees required to participate in
matters relating to claims against the Sellers, shall be permitted to do so
without loss of wages or benefits so long as such involvement on behalf of
Sellers does not unreasonably interfere with the discharge of their duties on
behalf of Buyer.



 

46 10.3. _Change of Sellers  Name_. Roanoke shall cease to use the
name "Roanoke Companies Group, Inc." in its business or as a corporate name
and shall take all actions necessary to amend its articles of incorporation so
as to change its name from "Roanoke Companies Group, Inc." to a name
not reasonably similar to that name, with the amendment to be effective no
later than two business days following the Closing Date. Chapco shall cease to
use the name "Chicago Adhesives Product Co." in its business or as a corporate
name and shall take all actions necessary to amend its articles of
incorporation so as to change its name from "Chicago Adhesives Product Co." to
a name not reasonably similar to that name, with the amendment to be effective
no later than two business days following the Closing Date.



10.4. _Further Assurances_. At any time and from time to time at and after the
Closing, upon request of Buyer, Sellers and the Shareholders shall do,
execute, acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be done, executed,
acknowledged and delivered, such further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers,
conveyances, powers of attorney, confirmations and assurances as Buyer may
reasonably request to more effectively convey, assign and transfer to and vest
in Buyer full legal right, title and interest in and actual possession of the
Assets and the Business and to generally carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement. Sellers shall also furnish Buyer with such information and
documents in its possession or under its control, or which Sellers can
execute or cause to be executed, as will enable Buyer to prosecute any and all
petitions, applications, claims and demands relating to or constituting a part
of the Assets and Business.



10.5. _State Tax Matters_. Each Seller shall retain for an appropriate period
(or file with the appropriate Governmental Authorities if required by statute)
any annual resale certificate or other exemption certificate provided to it by
Buyer in connection with the purchase of the Assets and shall timely file all
other exemption certificates or documents, if any, that are required to be
filed by each Seller in connection with purchase of the Assets in order to
minimize the Transfer Taxes required to be paid by Buyer.



11\. _POST-CLOSING AGREEMENTS_. The Parties acknowledge that after Closing
each Party may need access to information or documents in the control or
possession of another Party for the purposes of concluding the transactions
herein contemplated, preparing Tax Returns or conducting Tax audits, obtaining
insurance, complying with Legal Requirements, and prosecuting or defending
third-party claims. Accordingly, each Party shall keep, preserve and maintain
in the Ordinary Course of Business, and as required by Legal Requirements and
relevant insurance carriers, all books, records, documents and other
information in the possession or control of such Party and relevant to the
foregoing purposes at least until the expiration of any applicable statute of
limitations or extensions thereof. Each Party shall cooperate fully with, and
make available for inspection and copying by, the other Party, its employees,
agents, counsel and accountants and/or Governmental Authorities, upon written
request and at the expense of the requesting Party, such books, records
documents and other information to the extent reasonably necessary to
facilitate the foregoing purposes. In addition, each Party shall cooperate
with, and



 

47 shall permit and use its commercially reasonable best efforts to cause its
former and present directors, officers and employees to cooperate with, the
other Party on and after Closing in furnishing information, evidence,
testimony and other assistance in connection with any action, proceeding,
arrangement or dispute of any nature with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement. The exercise by any Party of any right of access granted
herein shall not materially interfere with the business operations of the
other Party.



12\. _INDEMNIFICATION_.



 

12.1. _Indemnification by Sellers and the Shareholders_.



(a) _Generally_. Subject to and to the extent provided in this Article 12,

liability of Sellers or the Shareholders in respect of claims arising under
Section 12.1(a)(i) exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in which case
Sellers and the Shareholders shall be obligated to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Buyers Indemnified Persons for all Losses in excess of the Basket;
_provided, however,_ the Basket shall not apply to Losses arising from (i)
Sellers or the Shareholders intentional misrepresentation or fraud, or (ii)

satisfied solely by the applicable Shareholder, including through the
withholding or setting off of payments under such Shareholders Employment
Agreement (if any).



12.3.  _Indemnification by Parent and Buyer_. Subject to and to the extent
provided in this Article 12, from and after Closing, Buyer and Parent, jointly
and severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers Indemnified

(a) Parent and Buyer shall have no liability for breach of representations and
warranties under Section 12.3(a), and no claim shall accrue against Parent
and Buyer for breach of representations and warranties under Section 12.3(a)
unless and until the aggregate liability of Parent or Buyer in respect of
claims arising under Section 12.3(a) exceeds the Basket, in which case Parent
and Buyer shall be obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers
Indemnified Persons for all Losses in excess of the Basket.



(b) Parents and Buyers aggregate liability for Losses to Sellers
Indemnified Persons under Section 12.3(a) shall not exceed $2 million;
_provided, however_ , that such limit shall not apply to Losses arising from
Parents or Buyers intentional misrepresentation or fraud.



12.5. _Notice and Control of Third-Party Claims_. If any claim or liability is
asserted in writing against a party entitled to indemnification under this
Article 12 (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") that would give rise to a claim under
this Article 12, the Indemnified Party shall notify the person giving the
indemnity (" _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of the same within 10 days of
receipt of such written assertion of a claim or liability. The Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to defend a claim and control the defense,
settlement and prosecution of any litigation. If the Indemnifying Party,
within 20 days after notice of such claim, fails to defend such claim, the
Indemnified Party will have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or
settlement of such claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the
Indemnifying Party. All Parties agree to cooperate fully as necessary in the
defense of such matters. Should the Indemnified Party fail to notify the
Indemnifying Party in the time required above, the Indemnifying Party shall
be relieved of its obligations pursuant to this Section 12.5 only to the
extent that such failure to notify in the time required above materially and
adversely affects the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend such
matter. Anything in this Section 12.5 notwithstanding, (i) if any claim
relates to the Stand N Seal Matter, involves any customer or supplier of the
Business, is a Product Liability Matter, or if there is a reasonable
probability that a claim may materially and adversely affect the Business
other than as a result of money damages or other money payments, and (ii) if
Sellers or Shareholders (or their insurers) are defending such claim, then,
regardless of whether



 

50 such claim would give rise to indemnification under this Section 12, Sellers
and Shareholders agree to keep Parent and Buyer apprised of all developments
of which Sellers or Shareholders are aware (as they occur) with respect to
negotiations and settlement of such claim, as well as any other material
developments with respect to pending litigation of such claim. With respect
to the Stand N Seal Matter, Sellers and Shareholders represent and warrant,
jointly and severally, that Sellers have agreed to indemnify and hold harmless
the Major Customer involved in such matter against all Losses associated
therewith. Sellers and Shareholders agree that they will comply with, and not
seek to alter, the current terms of such indemnification agreement.



12.6. _Notice of Other Claims_. If an Indemnified Party becomes aware of any
breach of the representations or warranties of the Indemnifying Party
hereunder or any other basis for indemnification under this Article 12 not
involving a third-party claim, the Indemnified Party shall notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of the same, specifying in detail the
circumstances and facts that give rise to a claim under this Article 12\.



12.7. _Limitation Period_. No claim pursuant to this Article 12 may be
asserted under this Agreement unless the party making the claim gives the
Party against whom the claim is to be made notice of such claim before the
end of the applicable survival period (as defined in Section 12.8); _provided,
however,_ that such claim shall survive the expiration of the survival period
if notice thereof, as required hereby, was previously given. 



12.8. _Survival of Representations; Indemnity Periods_. Notwithstanding any
right of Buyer (whether or not exercised) to investigate the Business or any
right of any Party (whether or not exercised) to investigate the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the other Party contained in this
Agreement, each of Sellers and the Shareholders has, on the one hand, and
Buyer has, on the other hand, the right to rely fully upon the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the other contained
in this Agreement. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
in this Agreement made by Sellers and the Shareholders and Buyer,
respectively, will survive Closing: (a) except as otherwise set forth therein,
indefinitely with respect to matters covered by Section 2.4; (b) until 60
days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations (including
all periods of extension, whether automatic or permissive) with respect to
matters covered by Sections 3.4 (Noncontravention), 3.12 (Title to Assets),
3.14 (Environmental Matters), 3.24 (Taxes), 3.27 (Brokers and Finders),
Article 4 or (c) the Stand N Seal Matter; and (d) until twenty-four months
after the Closing Date in the case of all other representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements, except that:



(i) any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that would otherwise
terminate in accordance with clause (b) or (c) above shall survive if notice
pursuant to Section 12.7 shall have been given on or prior to such
termination date, until the related claim for indemnification has been
satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in this Article 12;



 

51 (ii) in the event of intentional misrepresentation or fraud in the making of
any representation or warranty, all representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements that are the subject of the intentional misrepresentation or
fraud shall survive until 60 days after the expiration of all applicable
statutes of limitations (including all periods of extension, whether
automatic or permissive) with respect to matters covered thereby; and



(iii) rights to indemnification under this Article 12 will survive until any
claims brought hereunder shall have been satisfied or otherwise resolved as
provided herein.



12.9.  _Effect of Insurance and Third Party Proceeds_. The amount of
indemnification that a Party is required to pay to, for or on behalf of any
Person under this Section 12 will be reduced, including retroactively, by (but
only to the extent of) any insurance proceeds or amounts from third parties
that are actually recovered by such Party in reduction of the related Losses.
Further, if a Party indemnified under this Agreement has received, or if a
party that must indemnify under this Agreement has paid on such persons
behalf, an indemnity payment in respect of Losses and the Party seeking
indemnification under this Agreement subsequently receives, directly or
indirectly, insurance proceeds or amounts from third parties in respect of
such Losses, then such person must promptly pay to the party from whom
indemnification is sought the amount of such proceeds, or, if less, the amount
of such payment.



12.10 _Shareholders  Representative_.



(a) Each Shareholder hereby irrevocably appoints the Shareholders
Representative as its or his representative, attorney-in-fact, and agent, with
full power of substitution to act in the name, place, and stead of such
Shareholder in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement.
By executing this Agreement, Shareholders Representative accepts his
appointment and authorization to act as Shareholders Representative in
accordance with the terms hereof and agrees to perform his obligations
hereunder and otherwise comply with this Section 12.10.

reasonably related thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Shareholders Representative is specifically authorized:



(i) to assert claims, make demands, and commence actions on behalf of any
Shareholder under this Agreement;

under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;



(vi) to distribute any amounts he receives on behalf of Shareholders under the
Escrow Agreement; and



(vii) to perform all actions, exercise all powers, and fulfill all duties
otherwise assigned to him in this Agreement.



(c) The Shareholders Representative is hereby granted the sole and exclusive
authority to act on behalf of each Shareholder in respect of all matters
arising under Section 2.8, 2.9 or this Section 12, notwithstanding any dispute
or disagreement among the Shareholders, and no Shareholder shall have any
authority to act unilaterally or independently of the Shareholders
Representative in respect to any such matter.



(d) The Shareholders shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the Shareholders
Representative for, and hold the Shareholders Representative harmless
against, any Losses incurred without willful misconduct or bad faith on the
part of the Shareholders Representative, arising out of or in connection with
the Shareholders Representatives carrying out his duties under this
Agreement. The Shareholders Representative may consult with counsel of his
own choice and will have full and complete authorization and protection for
any action taken and suffered by him in good faith and in accordance with
the opinion of such counsel.



(e) The Shareholders Representative shall act solely in a representative
capacity on behalf of each Shareholder. The Shareholders Representative shall
owe no fiduciary obligations to any Shareholder. The Shareholders
Representative is not expected to devote its full business time to the
performance of his duties hereunder. The Shareholders Representative shall
have no obligations to account to any for his time or actions hereunder.



(f) A decision, act, consent, or instruction of the Shareholders
Representative shall constitute a decision of all Shareholders, as the case
may be, and shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon each Shareholder, as
the case may be. Parent, Buyer, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon
any decision, act, consent, or instruction of the Shareholders
Representative as being the decision, act, consent, or instruction of each
Shareholder, as the case may be. Parent, Buyer, and the Escrow Agent are
hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in
accordance with any decision, act, consent, or instruction of the
Shareholders Representative.



 

53 (g) Sellers and Shareholders agree to cause the Phantom Stock Participants
and Montalbano, to appoint, in the Escrow Agreement, the Shareholders
Representative as the representative of the Phantom Stock Participants and
Montalbano for all purposes related to the Escrow Agreement on substantially
the same terms as set forth in this Section 12.10.

Agreement as follows:

same.

close is a breach of the provisions of this Agreement, then the non-breaching

survive any termination of this Agreement.



 

54 14\. _GENERAL_.

accountants) has made or is making in this Agreement any representation to
any other Party (or such Partys counsel or accountants) concerning any of the

hereto, including consents, waivers and modifications that may hereafter be
executed, financial statements, certificates and other information previously
or hereafter furnished to any Party, may be reproduced by any Party by any

Ordinary Course of Business) and that any enlargement, facsimile or further
reproduction of such reproduction shall likewise be admissible in evidence.



14.4. _Time of Essence_. Time is of the essence in the performance of this
Agreement, _provided_ that, if the day on or by which a notice must or may be
given, or the performance of any Partys obligation is due, is a Saturday,

which such notice must or may be given, or that such performance is due, shall
automatically be extended to the first business day thereafter.



 

14.5. _Consents, Approvals and Discretion_. Except as herein expressly

same provision, (b) shall not waive or be construed to waive a breach or
violation of any other provision, and (c) shall be in writing and may not be

to be exclusive of any other remedy, and each and every remedy shall be in
addition to every other remedy granted in this Agreement or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity, by statute or otherwise. The election of any one
or more remedies by a Party shall not constitute a waiver of the right to
pursue other available remedies. In addition to any other rights and remedies
any Party may have at law or in equity for breach of this Agreement, each
Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or other equitable relief to
enforce the provisions of this Agreement without the posting of any bond.

or to such other address or number, and to the attention of such other Person,
as any Party may designate at any time in writing in conformity with
this Section 13.10.



14.11.  _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is held or
determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future
law, and if the rights or obligations of any Party under this Agreement will
not be materially and adversely affected thereby: (a) such provision will be
fully severable; (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never



 

57 comprised a part of this Agreement; (c) the remaining provisions of this
Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected by
the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision or by its severance from this
Agreement; and (d) in lieu of such illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision, there will be added automatically as a part of this Agreement a
legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision as may be possible.



 

14.12. _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement supersedes all previous
contracts, agreements and understandings and constitutes the entire agreement
of whatsoever kind or nature existing between or among the Parties
representing the within subject matter and no Party shall be entitled to
benefits other than those specified herein. As between or among the
Parties, any oral or written representation, agreement or statement not
expressly incorporated herein, whether given prior to or on the Closing Date,
shall be of no force and effect unless and until made in writing and signed by
the Parties on or after the Closing Date. The representations and warranties
set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and remain in full force
and effect as provided in Article 12, and shall survive the execution and
delivery of all other agreements, instruments or other documents described,
referenced or contemplated herein and shall not be merged herewith or
therewith. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each
and all of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall
constitute but the same instrument. This Agreement may not be amended except
in a written instrument executed the Parties.



14.13. _Interest_. Unless otherwise provided herein to the contrary, any
monies required to be paid by any Party to another Party pursuant to this
Agreement shall be due two business days after demand therefor and if not paid
when due shall accrue interest from and after the due date to and including
the date full payment is made at an annual rate equal to the prime rate in
effect for the relevant period as reported by the Wall Street Journal under
"Money Rates."



14.14. _Drafting_. No provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted for or
against any Person on the basis that such Person was the draftsman of such
provision, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Person by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.



14.15. _Confidentiality; Public Announcements_.



(a) Except as required by Legal Requirements, Sellers and the Shareholders,
on the one hand, and Parent and Buyer, on the other hand, shall keep this
Agreement and its contents confidential and not disclose the same to any
Person (except the Parties attorneys, accountants or other
professional advisers and except to the applicable Governmental Authorities
in connection with any Tax Return, required notification or application for
approval or a license or exemption therefrom) without the prior written
consent of the other Party. 



 

58 (b) At all times before the Closing, Sellers and the Shareholders, on the one
hand, and Parent and Buyer, on the other hand, will consult with the other
before issuing or making any reports, statements or releases to the public
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and
will use good faith efforts to obtain the other Partys approval of the text
of any public report, statement or release to be made on behalf of such Party.
If either Party is unable to obtain the approval of its public report,
statement or release from the other Party and such report, statement or
release is, in the opinion of legal counsel to such Party, necessary to
discharge such Partys disclosure obligations under law, then such Party may
make or issue the legally required report, statement or release and promptly
furnish the other Party a copy thereof. Nothing herein shall prohibit any
Party from responding to questions presented by the press or media without
first obtaining prior written consent of the other Party.



14.16 _Parent Guaranty_. Parent irrevocably guarantees each and every
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement and obligation of Buyer and the
full and timely performance of Buyers obligations under this Agreement. This
is a guarantee of payment and performance, and not merely of collection, and
Parent acknowledges and agrees that this guarantee is full and unconditional,
and no release or extinguishments of Buyers obligations or liabilities (other
than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), whether by decree in
any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, shall affect the continuing validity
and enforceability of this guarantee. Buyer hereby waives, for the benefit of
Sellers, Shareholders, and their Affiliates (i) any right to require Sellers
or any of their Affiliates, as a condition of payment or performance by
Parent, to proceed against Buyer or to pursue any other remedies whatsoever,
and (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by law, any defenses or benefits that
may be derived from or afforded by law that limit the liability of or
exonerate guarantors or sureties.
