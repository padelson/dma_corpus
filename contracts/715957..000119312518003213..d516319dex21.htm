the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Company Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled Shares,
which shall be treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)_) shall
cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each such Company Share, whether represented by a certificate (" _Certificate_
") or in non-certificated form and represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry
Share_ "), shall automatically be converted into the right to receive 0.6690
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable Parent Shares (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). Following the Effective Time, the holders of
Company Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except for the rights set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)(v)_.

(b) _Cancellation of Cancelled Shares_. Each Company Share owned by Parent,
Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent and each Company
Share owned by the Company or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company
(collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall cease to be outstanding,
shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall
cease to exist.

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, without par
value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock, without par value, of the Surviving
Corporation, and all such shares together shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

SECTION 2.02. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Performance Shares_. At the Effective Time, each performance
share award granted under a Company Equity Award Plan that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Performance Share Award_
") shall fully vest at the target level of performance and shall be cancelled
and converted automatically into the right to receive the Equity Award
Consideration in respect of each Company Share underlying such Company
Performance Share Award.

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each
restricted stock unit award in respect of Company Shares granted under a
Company Equity Award Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (a " _Company RSU_ ") shall fully vest and shall be cancelled
and converted automatically into the right to receive the Equity Award
Consideration in respect of each Company Share underlying such Company RSU.

 



3 (c) _Treatment of Deferred Units_. At the Effective Time, each deferred unit
in respect of Company Shares credited or deemed credited to the Company stock
ledger under the Director Compensation and Deferral Plan or the Executive
Deferred Compensation Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (a " _Company Deferred Unit_ ") shall be converted
automatically into a number of deferred unit(s) in respect of Parent Shares
equal to the product of (x) the Company Deferred Unit multiplied by (y) the
Merger Consideration, to be payable pursuant to the terms of the applicable
plan.

(d) _Payment_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the Equity Award
Consideration as required under _Section_ __ _ 2.02(a)_ and _Section_ __ _
2.02(b)_ as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in
any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter); _provided_ ,  _however_
, that to the extent any such payment relates to any Company Performance Share
Awards or Company RSUs that are nonqualified deferred compensation subject to
Section 409A of the Code, the Surviving Corporation shall make such payment
at the earliest time permitted under, and in accordance with, the terms of the
applicable award agreement or other relevant documents and in accordance with
Section 409A of the Code.

 

(e) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board or any authorized committee thereof, as applicable, shall adopt
any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.02(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 2.02(b)_ and _Section_
__ _ 2.02(c)_. The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that,
from and after the Effective Time, neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation will be required to deliver Company Shares or other capital stock
of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company
Performance Share Awards, Company RSUs, Company Deferred Units or any other
awards under any Company Equity Award Plan.

 

SECTION 2.03. _Exchange of Company Shares_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a
paying and exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") and enter into an agreement with such Exchange Agent in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company pursuant to which the
Exchange Agent will (i) act as agent for the shareholders of the Company in
connection with the Merger and receive payment and delivery of the Merger
Consideration to which the shareholders of the Company shall become entitled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_ and (ii) act as agent for Parent in
transmitting the Merger Consideration to such shareholders following the
occurrence of the Effective Time in accordance with this Agreement. At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company
Shares, an amount of Parent Shares in book-entry form sufficient for the
Exchange Agent to pay and deliver the Merger Consideration required to be paid
and delivered by Parent in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_. In
addition, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent, from time to time after the Effective Time, (A) any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(g)_ and (B) cash in
lieu of any fractional Parent Shares payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.03(h)_. All cash and Parent Shares, together with any dividends or
other distributions, deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)_ shall be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Transmittal Materials and Instructions_. Promptly after the Effective
Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or otherwise provide to each holder of
record of Company Shares (other than holders of Cancelled Shares) (A)
transmittal materials, including a letter of transmittal in form as agreed by
Parent and the Company, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title shall

 



4  pass, with respect to Book-Entry Shares, only upon delivery of an "agents
message" regarding the book-entry transfer of Book-Entry Shares (or such other
evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
request), and with respect to Certificates, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in
_ Section_ __ _ 2.03(f)_ to the Exchange Agent), such transmittal materials
to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company
may reasonably agree, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Book-Entry Shares or Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of
the Certificates as provided in _ Section_ __ _ 2.03(f)_) to the Exchange
Agent.

 

(ii) _Certificates_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu of the Certificate as provided in _ Section_ __ _ 2.03(f)_) to the
Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of transmittal materials and
instructions referred to in _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)(i)_, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a cash
amount in immediately available funds equal to (1) any dividends and other
distributions such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _ Section_ __
_ 2.03(g)_ plus (2) any cash in lieu of any fractional Parent Shares such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to _ Section_ __ _ 2.03(h)_ and (B)
the number of Parent Shares, in uncertificated book-entry form, equal to the
number of Company Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _ Section_ __ _ 2.03(f)_)
multiplied by the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any cash amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates.

(iii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive as a result of the Merger pursuant to _ Section_ __ _
2.01(a)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry
Shares (other than Cancelled Shares) shall upon receipt by the Exchange Agent
of an "agents message" in customary form (it being understood that the
holders of Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have surrendered such Company
Shares upon receipt by the Exchange Agent of such "agents message" or such
other evidence, if any, as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) be
entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and
deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, (A) a
cash amount in immediately available funds equal to (1) any dividends and
other distributions such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _
Section_ __ _ 2.03(g)_ plus (2) any cash in lieu of any fractional
Parent Shares such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _ Section_ __
_ 2.03(h)_ and (B) the number of Parent Shares, in uncertificated book-entry
form, equal to the number of Company Shares represented by such Book-
Entry Shares multiplied by the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any cash amount payable upon due surrender of the Book-Entry
Shares.

 

(iv) _Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments_. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company or if payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration and the
other payments contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_ and this _Section_ __
_ 2.03_ is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share may be exchanged in accordance with this _Article II_ if the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly representing such Company Shares is
presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer
or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 



5 (v) _Rights of Holders of Company Shares; Expenses_. Until surrendered
or exchanged pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_, each Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender or exchange the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_, any dividends and
other distributions pursuant to _ Section_ __ _ 2.03(g)_ and any cash in
lieu of any fractional Parent Shares pursuant to _ Section_ __ _ 2.03(h)_.
Parent shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Exchange
Agent, in connection with the exchange of Company Shares pursuant to this
_Article II_.

 

(c) _Termination of the Exchange Fund; No Liability_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains
undistributed one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, upon demand by Parent. Any holders of
Company Shares (other than Cancelled Shares) who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article_ __ _ II_ shall thereafter be entitled to look
only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment and delivery of the
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_, any dividends and
other distributions pursuant to _ Section_ __ _ 2.03(g)_ and any cash in
lieu of any fractional Parent Shares pursuant to _ Section_ __ _ 2.03(h)_
upon surrender of their Certificates or exchange of their Book-Entry Shares
in accordance with the provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_, and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for (subject to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law) payment of their
claims for the Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of their
Certificates or exchange of their Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Company,
the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder
of Company Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law.

 

(d) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the
cash portion of the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by
the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1
or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion, or in money market funds which are invested in instruments that
consist of U.S. Treasury obligations and repurchase agreements collateralized
by U.S. Treasury obligations or having a rating in the highest investment
category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of
acquisition or a combination of the foregoing and, in any such case, no such
instrument shall have a maturity that could prevent or delay payments to be
made pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_, to the
extent that there are losses with respect to such investment of the cash
portion of the Exchange Fund, or the cash portion of the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons, such that the amount of cash in the Exchange
Fund is below the level required to make prompt cash payment of any dividends
and other distributions pursuant to _ Section_ __ _ 2.03(g)_ and any cash in
lieu of any fractional Parent Shares pursuant to _ Section_ __ _ 2.03(h)_,
Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost
through such investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange
Fund is at all applicable times maintained at a level sufficient to make such
cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
aggregate amount of the payments described in the immediately preceding
sentence will be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
requested by Parent. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than as contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)_ and this _Section_ __ _
2.03(d)_.

(e) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the Company Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
acceptable evidence of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer, (i) in the
case of Certificates, the holder of such Certificate shall be given a copy of
the transmittal materials and instructions referred to in _Section_ __ _
2.03(b)(i)_ and instructed to comply with the instructions thereto in order to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_ and
(ii) in the case of Book-Entry Shares, such Book-Entry Share shall be
cancelled and exchanged as contemplated by this _Article II_.

 



6 (f) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in a reasonable amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay and
deliver in exchange for such Certificate the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_, any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(g)_ and any cash in lieu of any fractional
Parent Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(h)_.

 

(g) _Dividends_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with
respect to Parent Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any Certificate with respect to the Parent Shares that
such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Certificate,
until such holder shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with _
Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)(ii)_. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of
any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of Parent Shares
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) promptly after the time of

in the SEC Reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,

control over financial reporting required by Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act and such internal control is effective in all material
respects in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of such
Reporting Companys financial reporting and such Reporting Companys
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP. Each Reporting Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to such Reporting Companys

in effect on the date of any such filing. As of the time of filing with the
SEC (or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of
such amendment), none of the Applicable Parent SEC Reports so filed contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except to the extent that the information in such Applicable
Parent SEC Reports has been amended or superseded by a later Applicable
Parent SEC Report.

(ii) As of their respective dates, the audited and unaudited financial
statements (consolidated, as applicable, and including any related notes
thereto) of each of Parent and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, included in
the Applicable Parent SEC Reports have been prepared in all material respects
(except, as applicable, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC or other
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC) in accordance with GAAP applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
as of the respective dates thereof (taking into account the notes thereto) and
the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated (taking into account the notes thereto) and subject, in the case of
unaudited financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments.

 

(iii) Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act and such disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in all material respects to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by Parent in the SEC Reports it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation
of Parents SEC Reports and other public disclosure documents. Parent
maintains internal control over financial reporting required by Rule 13a-15(f)
or Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act and such internal control is
effective in all material respects in providing reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of Parents financial reporting and Parents preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Parent
has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date of this
Agreement, to Parents outside auditors and the audit committee of Parents
board of directors (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely
to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B) to the Knowledge of Parent, any fraud that
involves management or other employees of Parent who have a significant role
in Parents internal control over financial reporting.

Subsidiaries of a nature that would be required under GAAP to be reflected or
reserved on a financial statement (consolidated, as applicable) of Parent,

consistent with past practice since September 30, 2017, (C) liabilities or

pending or threatened material investigation or inquiry by a Governmental

January 1, 2016, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice from any Governmental Entity regarding any violation of, or
failure to comply with, any Law, except as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

required to be paid or discharged, other than Taxes being contested in good

technical advice memoranda or rulings that have been entered into or issued
by any Tax authority with respect to Parent or any of its wholly-owned
Subsidiaries which are still in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

determines in good faith (x) after consultation with the Companys financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is, or

prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, the Company Board may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change (and, solely with respect to a Superior
Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)(i)_) if
(i) the Company has received a Superior Proposal other than as a result of a
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 4.02_ and the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the receipt of such Superior
Proposal would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and (ii) (A) the Company provides Parent
prior written notice of its intent to make any Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)(i)_ at
least

notice shall specify the basis for such Company Adverse Recommendation Change

Superior Proposal that (x) include any terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal and (y) were not produced by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of its or their Representatives solely for internal purposes,
if applicable (a " _Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") (it being understood
that such Notice of Recommendation Change shall not in itself be deemed a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change and that any change in price or material
revision or material amendment to the terms of a Superior Proposal, if
applicable, shall require a new notice to which the provisions of clauses (A),
(B) and (C) of this _Section_ __ _ 4.02(f)_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_
 except that, in the case of such a new notice, all references to four (4)
Business Days in this _Section_ __ _ 4.02(f)_ shall be deemed to be two (2)
Business Days), (B) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by
Parent, the Company shall make its Representatives reasonably available to
negotiate in good faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding any
modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that Parent
proposes to make and (C) at the end of such four (4) Business Day period and
taking into account any modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed
by Parent to the Company in a written, binding and irrevocable offer, the
Company Board determines in good faith (x) after consultation with the
Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Superior
Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) after consultation with
the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, other than in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal (which shall be governed by _Section_
__ _ 4.02(f)_), at any time prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote,
the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if (i) an
Intervening Event occurs and in response thereto the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (ii) (A) the
Company provides Parent prior written notice of its intent to make any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change at least four (4) Business Days prior to taking
such action to the effect that the Company Board has resolved to effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, which notice shall specify the basis
therefor and include a reasonably detailed description of the Intervening
Event, (B) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent,
the Company shall make its Representatives reasonably available to negotiate
in good faith with Parent and its Representatives regarding any modifications
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that Parent proposes to make and
(C) at the end of such four (4) Business Day period and taking into account
any modifications to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the
Company in a written, binding and irrevocable offer, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. Each time there is a material change to the facts or
circumstances relating to the Intervening Event prior to obtaining the Company
Requisite Vote, the Company will be required to deliver to Parent prompt
written notice of such material change (which notice shall include a
reasonably detailed description of such material change) and the Company will
provide Parent with an additional two (2) Business Day period prior to making
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, such period shall begin upon the date
of Parents receipt of the notice of such material change.

 



35 (h) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 4.02_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from (i)
complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law,
(ii) making any "stop, look or listen" communication to the shareholders of
the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or
any similar communications to the shareholders of the Company) or (iii) making
any other disclosure to its shareholders if the Company Board determines in
good faith after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel that
the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

assume, honor and continue during the Continuation Period or, if later, until
all obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the Companys
employment, severance, retention, termination, deferred compensation, and

or the Surviving Corporation may not amend, modify or terminate any such plan,
policy, program, agreement or arrangement unless and solely to the extent

or otherwise as required to comply with applicable Law. In addition, to the
extent required by the express terms of any Company Benefit Plan, Parent

Date (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans) for purposes
of determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits and vesting (but
not benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan), each
Company Employees service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as
well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such
Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized
by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any
Commonly Controlled Entity, in each case, to the extent such service would
have been recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries under analogous
Company Benefit Plans prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service;
and, provided further, that no Company Employee shall be entitled based on
such prior credited service or otherwise to participate in any frozen or
grandfathered plan or benefit formula of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
that would not be offered to employees first hired by Parent or its

(and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and
after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that
in the case of an insured plan, such waivers shall be made only to

 



43  the extent the insurer consents thereto, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent.
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize the
dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by
each Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar
year or plan year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of
satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations under the
relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be eligible to participate
from and after the Effective Time; provided, however, that in the case of an
insured plan, such amounts shall be taken into account only to the extent the
insurer consents thereto, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent.

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.06_ are solely for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement, and no other Person (including any current or
former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.06_, and no provision of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.06_ shall create such rights in any such Persons. Except as
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.06(b)_, no provision of this Agreement shall

Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) to prohibit Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) from having the right to terminate
the employment of any such employee, (iii) to require Parent or its
Subsidiaries to continue to pay or provide any such employee any compensation
or benefits after such termination of employment, other than any severance

to permit the amendment, modification or termination of any Company Benefit
Plan or employee benefit plan of Parent or its Subsidiaries (in each case

amendment or modification of the terms of any Company Benefit Plan or employee
benefit plan or Parent or its Subsidiaries.

expenses.

 

SECTION 5.08. _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, each present
and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each
case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_

reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages and
liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any
Proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall advance
expenses to each Indemnified Party claiming indemnification pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.08_ as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Indemnified Party provides
an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that
such Indemnified Party is not entitled to such indemnification.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor the provisions regarding (i) exculpation of directors,
(ii) limitation of liability of directors and officers, (iii) advancement of
expenses and (iv) indemnification, in each case, contained in the Company
Organizational Documents (as in effect as of the date hereof), the comparable
organizational documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries (as in effect as
of the date hereof) or any indemnification Contract set forth in Section
5.08(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter between the

 



44  applicable Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
existing immediately prior to the Effective Time (it being understood and
agreed that, for the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the foregoing obligation of Parent shall apply with respect
to, and remain in full force and effect as to any pending or future claim,
hearing, investigation or Proceeding relating to or arising out of the
construction, or cessation of the construction, of nuclear power Units 2 and 3
at the Summer Station or the bankruptcy of Westinghouse Electric Company, LLC
(including the settlement agreement entered into with Toshiba Corporation and

years following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries not to amend, replace or otherwise modify the
provisions regarding (A) exculpation of directors, (B) limitation of
liability of directors and officers, (C) advancement of expenses and (D)
indemnification, in each case, contained in their respective organizational
documents; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such three (3) year period shall be
extended for so long as any Proceeding is pending or asserted against an
Indemnified Party that implicates the rights set forth in the foregoing
clauses (A) through (D);  _provided_ , _further_ , that such prohibition on
amendments, replacements and other modifications shall not apply to
amendments, replacements and other modifications that are prospective in their
application and exclude any effect on the Indemnified Parties.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain for a period of at least six (6) years following the
Effective Time directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance policies (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with benefits, levels of coverage and terms and
conditions at least as favorable as the Companys DandO Insurance existing
immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including for acts or omissions
in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such DandO
Insurance coverage an annual premium amount greater than three hundred percent
(300%) of the aggregate amount of the annual premiums currently paid by
the Company for DandO Insurance immediately prior to the Effective Time (such
aggregate amount of premiums currently paid, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_
"). If the annual premiums of such DandO Insurance coverage exceed the
Maximum Annual Premium, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a
policy with as much coverage as reasonably available for an annual cost not
exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium.

 

(d) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 5.08(c)_, the Company may in its sole
discretion obtain, prior to the Effective Time, six (6) year pre-paid "tail"
insurance coverage, at an aggregate cost no greater than six times the Maximum
Annual Premium, providing for DandO Insurance not materially less favorable than
that described in _Section_ __ _ 5.08(c)_. If the Company has obtained such
policy pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.08(d)_, Parent will cause such
policy to be maintained in full force and effect for its full term and cause
all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation, and
Parent will have no further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.08(c)_.

 

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates or merges with or into any other Person and is
not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, shall assume and comply with all of the obligations applicable to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, respectively, set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.08_.

 



45 (f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.08_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.
The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation in this _Section_ __ _
5.08_ may not be terminated or modified in any manner that adversely
affects any Indemnified Party without the consent of such Indemnified Party.
Parent will honor, guaranty and stand as surety for, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and successors to honor and comply
with, the covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.08_.

(g) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.08_
shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any rights such Indemnified
Parties may have under the Company Organizational Documents or any of the
comparable organizational documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries, or
under any applicable Contracts or Law.

SECTION 5.09. _Financing_.

activities of Parent, including any registration statement filed with the SEC
where Parent determines that the inclusion of such information is required or
desirable, and (ii) request that its independent accountants provide
customary and reasonable assistance to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, in connection with providing customary comfort letters in
connection with the financing activities of Parent;  _provided_ , _further_ ,

of (A) legal opinions or reliance letters or any certificate as to solvency or
any other certificate necessary for such financing activities, other than as
allowed by the preceding clause (ii), (B) any audited financial information or
any financial information prepared in accordance with Regulation S-K or
Regulation S-X under the Securities Act or any financial information in a form
not customarily prepared by the Company with respect to any period or (C) any
financial information with respect to a month or fiscal period that has not
yet ended or has ended less than forty-five (45) days prior to the date of
such request.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_): (i) nothing in this Agreement
(including this _Section_ __ _ 5.09_) shall require any such cooperation set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 5.09(a)_ to the extent that it would require the

the Effective Time, (B) provide any cooperation that would unreasonably

extent otherwise relating to the Company and required by the financing
activities of Parent), (E) require the Company or the Subsidiaries of the
Company to provide _pro forma_ financial statements or _pro forma_ adjustments

of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective boards of directors (or
equivalent bodies) to approve or authorize the financing activities of Parent,
and (ii) no action, liability or obligation (including any obligation to pay

under any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or instrument
relating to the financing activities of Parent shall be effective until the
Effective Time.

(c) Parent shall (i) promptly reimburse the Company for all reasonable and

in the case of fraud.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, promptly following
Parents request, the Company shall deliver to each of the lenders with
respect to the Indebtedness set forth in Section 5.09(d) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter (the " _Existing Loan Lenders_ ") a notice (an " _Existing
Loan Notice_ ") prepared by Parent, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company, notifying each of the Existing Loan Lenders of this
Agreement and the contemplated Merger. At Parents election, the Existing

written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder may be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation
of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto. Any purported assignment in contravention
of this Agreement is and shall be null and void. Subject to the immediately
preceding two sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 

SECTION 8.12. _Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that any of the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that each party
hereto shall be entitled to seek an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to seek to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties
hereto further agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (A) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (B) an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Any party hereto seeking an Order to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security
in connection with any such Order.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably (i) submits itself to the
personal jurisdiction of the federal courts located in the State of Delaware
and any appellate court therefrom, in connection with any claim or matter
directly or indirectly based upon, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement, (ii) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that it
will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
federal courts located in the State of Delaware and (iv) agrees that the
service of any process, summons, notice or document through the notice
procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.05_ or by U.S. registered mail to
the respective addresses set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.05_ shall be
effective service of process for any Proceeding in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party
hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion,
as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding with respect to
this Agreement, any claim that (A) it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve process in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 8.12(b)_, (B) it or
its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from
any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), (C) the Proceeding in any such
court is brought in an inconvenient 

 



60  forum, (D) the venue of such Proceeding is improper, or (E) this Agreement,
or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.
Furthermore, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub irrevocably waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the benefit of any defense
that would hinder, fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any
amount to which any party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any
court having jurisdiction. Each party hereto expressly acknowledges that the
foregoing waiver is intended to be irrevocable under the Law of the State of
Delaware and of the United States of America; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
each such partys consent to jurisdiction and service contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 8.12_ is solely for the purpose referred to in this _Section_
__ _ 8.12_ and shall not be deemed to be a general submission to said courts
or to courts in the State of Delaware other than for such purpose.

SECTION 8.13. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
ANY AND ALL RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BASED
UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE
COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF
THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.13_.

 

SECTION 8.14. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force
and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to
the end that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to
the fullest extent possible.

SECTION 8.15. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent and Merger Sub
when due.

 

SECTION 8.16. _Disclosure Letter_ _s_. Certain items and matters are listed in
the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter for
informational purposes only and may not be required to be listed therein by
the terms of this Agreement. In no event shall the listing of items or matters
in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter be deemed or
interpreted to broaden, or otherwise expand the scope of, the representations
and warranties or covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement. No
reference to, or disclosure of, any item or matter in any Section of this
Agreement or any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter or
the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an admission or indication
that such item or matter is material or that such item or matter is required
to be referred to or disclosed in this Agreement or in the Company

 



61  Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable. Without
limiting the foregoing, no reference to, or disclosure of, a possible breach
or violation of any Contract or Law in the Company Disclosure Letter or the
Parent Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an admission or indication that
a breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. Each section or
subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter,
as the case may be, shall be deemed to qualify the corresponding section or
subsection of this Agreement, irrespective of whether or not any particular
section or subsection of this Agreement specifically refers to the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, as the case may
be.

SCPSC PETITION



   1. | To meet commitments made by South Carolina Electric and Gas Company
to the SCPSC, South Carolina Electric and Gas Company and Parent will jointly
file the Petition on or before January 12, 2018.  
---|--- 



   2. | The Petition will seek a ruling from the SCPSC (i) approving the
Merger with no material changes to the terms of the Merger; (ii) making a
finding that the Merger is in the public interest; or (iii) making a finding
that there is an absence of harm to South Carolina rate payers as a result of
the Merger. 
---|--- 



   3. | The Petition will acknowledge that the Merger can only close if
the SCPSC approves the jointly proposed NND Project cost recovery plan, with
(x) no material change to the terms, conditions or undertakings set forth in
the plan and (y) no significant change to the economic value of the plan, in
each case as reasonably determined by Parent in good faith (except in each
case unless otherwise consented to by Parent in its sole discretion), which
shall include the following terms: 
---|--- 



     | a. | There will be an aggregate up-front, one-time rate credit
totaling $1.3 billion1 to all current South Carolina Electric and Gas Company
electric customers as of the date of Merger close. The rate credit will be
apportioned to all retail electric customer classes based on their 2016
contribution to summer adjusted peak demand as prepared by South Carolina
Electric and Gas Company. After the dollar apportionment per customer class and
rate schedule is determined on this basis, a rate per kilowatt hour ($/kWh)
will be derived by customer class and rate schedule by dividing the total kWh
sales of electricity by customer class and rate schedule over a preceding
12-month period (the "Base Period") into the apportioned funding amount. The
$/kWh rate will then be applied to each customers kWh usage over the Base
Period to determine the customers up-front rate credit amount. The rate
credit will be issued to eligible customers in the form of a check issued
within 90 days of Merger close. Eligible customers shall be South Carolina
Electric and Gas Company retail electric customers as of record on the date of
the close of the Merger. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | b. | South Carolina Electric and Gas Company will immediately upon
Merger closing write down its investment in construction work in progress
associated with the new nuclear development project by approximately $1.4
billion, which amount includes approximately $1.2 billion in assets that have
not previously been subject to consideration in setting revised rates and
approximately $200 million that have been so considered. The amounts
written down would be permanently excluded from consideration in establishing
retail electric rates going forward. 
---|---|--- 



     | c. | South Carolina Electric and Gas Company will not seek recovery
of the approximately $320 million in regulatory assets associated with the
following items: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | i. | The approximately $173 million regulatory asset associated
with interest rate swap losses related to the debt that was not issued for the
NND Project; 
---|---|--- 
 



   1  | The net proceeds of the Toshiba settlement were utilized by South
Carolina Gas and Electric Company to repay indebtedness in 2017, and therefore
those funds are unavailable for refund. A portion of the one time rate credit
will be funded through issuance of debt and defeasement of the regulatory
liability associated with the Toshiba settlement. 
---|--- 
 



A-1 associated with the NND Project Equity AFUDC; 
---|---|--- 



     | iii. | The approximately $52 million regulatory asset associated
with the carrying costs on deferred tax assets related to nuclear
construction; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | iv. | The regulatory asset associated with foregone domestic
production activities deductions will be written off and not be recovered from
customers. The net regulatory asset associated with research and
experimentation credit claims, interest, and legal costs expected to be
incurred in defending these claims, will be borne by the shareholders and not
returned to or collected from customers. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | d. | Parent will underwrite an approximately $575 million refund
for amounts previously collected under the NND Project (regulatory liability)
which is estimated to provide the 3.5% retail electric rate decrease from the
2017 rate level until accumulated amortization of the cost of abandoned plant
lowers South Carolina Electric and Gas Companys revenue requirements. The
refund amount is calculated to be sufficient to support the 3.5% retail
electric rate reduction for approximately eight (8) years following the
closing of the Merger. This amount of time is estimated to be sufficient to
avoid a future retail electric rate increase resulting from new nuclear
project costs when the refund amount is exhausted. 
---|---|--- 



     | e. | Parent will reduce retail electric rates further to reflect
the impact of federal tax reform passed in December of 2017 which is estimated
to lower rates an additional amount resulting in a total estimated
rate reduction of approximately 5%. 
---|---|--- 



     | f. | An SCPSC finding, as necessary, that South Carolina Electric
and Gas Companys investment in construction work in progress for new nuclear
project in the amount of approximately $3.3 billion, which reflects the
amount of that investment net of write-downs and offsets, was prudent; and
that the capital costs and amortization of that $3.3 billion may be recovered
through retail electric rates. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | g. | An SCPSC order directing that: 
---|---|--- 



     | i. | The approximately $3.3 billion of invested capital for the
new nuclear development project shall be included in a regulatory asset and
recovered through rates over a 20-year amortization and recovery period that
is reflected in retail electric revenue requirements without offset or
disallowance until the regulatory asset is fully recovered; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | ii. | Until the balance in the regulatory asset is fully
recovered, the capital costs associated with the unrecovered balance in that
account shall be reflected in South Carolina Electric and Gas Companys cost
of capital devoted to retail electric operations at a rate that reflects a
return on common equity of 10.25%,2 a weighted average cost of debt of 5.85%,
and a capital structure consisting of 52.81% equity and 47.19% debt, with
these percentages fixed over the 20-year amortization period. 
---|---|--- 
 



   2  | The current allowed blended ROE for NND is approximately 10.9% but
the proposal is to adjust the rate down to South Carolina Gas and Electric
Companys base ROE of 10.25%. 
---|--- 
 



A-2 abandonment of the NND Project shall reduce the NND Project cost to be
recovered from South Carolina Electric and Gas Company customers. The deferred
tax asset for the net operating loss carryforward resulting from the tax
abandonment of the NND Project shall be reflected as a rate base offset,
dollar for dollar, to the deferred tax liability. Reductions in the deferred
tax asset shall be subject to Parents ability to use the net operating loss
in filing its consolidated income tax returns and shall not be computed on a
separate company basis. 
---|---|--- 



     | i. | Adjustments to the deferred tax liability and the deferred
tax asset described in item (h) of this subsection resulting from a change in
tax laws or tax treatment of the abandonment and/or Parents ability to use
the net operating loss will be returned to or recovered from South Carolina
Electric and Gas Company customers in the following manner: 
---|---|--- 



     | i. | The regulatory liability resulting from excess deferred tax
liabilities on the tax abandonment will be returned to customers over the book
recovery period of the property ( _i.e_., 20 years); 
---|---|--- 
 



     | ii. | The regulatory asset resulting from excess deferred tax
assets on the net operating loss will be recovered from customers in a manner
that coincides with Parents ability to use the net operating loss in filing
its consolidated income tax returns and not on a separate company basis; and 
---|---|--- 



     | iii. | As adjusted for any impacts related to the tax treatment of
the abandonment loss 
---|---|--- 



     | j. | The approximately $180 million initial capital investment in
the Columbia Energy Center, a 540-megawatt combined-cycle, natural gas-fired
power plant located in Gaston, S.C., will be excluded from rate base and rate
recovery, with only the ongoing costs such as fuel costs, operations and
maintenance expense, and maintenance or improvement capital investments
associated with the plant to be recovered in future base and fuel rates. 
---|---|--- 



     | k. | Transmission projects associated with the new nuclear project
will be closed to rate base and removed from BLRA project costs. The revenue
of approximately $32 million per year currently being recovered in base rates
will continue to be recovered through base rates notwithstanding the Merger.
The associated depreciation and operating and maintenance costs will be
captured in a regulatory asset for future rate recovery. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | l. | Except for rate adjustments for fuel and environmental costs,
demand side management costs and other rates routinely adjusted on an annual
or biannual basis, retail electric base rates will remain frozen at
current levels until January 1, 2021. 
---|---|--- 



   4. | The parties shall request approval of the SCPSC Petition,
including the NND Project cost recovery plan, within 6 months from the date of
filing. 
---|--- 
 



   5. |

South Carolina Electric and Gas Company and Parent commit to support and
advocate for SCPSC approval or adoption of the terms, both individually and
collectively, and without modification, identified and described in Paragraphs
(2) and (3) above (the "Merger Terms") and will take no action inconsistent
with this commitment. In the Petition to be jointly filed on January 12,
2018, South Carolina Electric and Gas Company may also present alternative terms
for NND Project cost recovery, consistent with and based on the terms
publically disclosed by Mr. Kissam on November 

---|--- 
 



A-3 comprehensive form in a proposed draft of the Petition (the "Alternative
Terms"). South Carolina Electric and Gas Company may provide any necessary
testimony, exhibits or supporting materials in order to meet prior commitments
to the SCPSC concerning the substance of South Carolina Electric and Gas
Companys January 12, 2018 filing or to show that the Alternative Terms, as a
disfavored alternative to the Merger Terms, are nonetheless just, reasonable,
lawful, fair and non-confiscatory and should be adopted by the SCPSC if the
Merger is not approved. However, South Carolina Electric and Gas Company will
not support or advocate for the Alternative Terms except as an expressly
disfavored alternative to the Merger Terms and in each case where it discusses
the Alternative Terms in testimony, exhibits or otherwise, will expressly
state South Carolina Electric and Gas Companys overriding commitment to the
Merger Terms as being in the best interest of customers and the State of South
Carolina, and that the Alternative Terms are a disfavored alternative to be
considered only if the Merger is disapproved. South Carolina Electric and Gas
Company will not otherwise advocate for any other terms for NND cost recovery
differing from those identified in Paragraphs (2) and (3) above (without
prior consent of Parent), unless and until the Merger Agreement is terminated.
