This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the "Agreement") is made and entered into

Riverside Fund IV, L.P., and Sidney R. Knafel (together, the "Shareholders'
Agent").

  

  

RECITALS

  

  

A. The Boards of Directors of Company, Parent and Merger Sub believe it is in
the best interests of their respective companies and the shareholders of their
respective companies that Company and Merger Sub combine into a single company
through the statutory merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (the

B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Company shall be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein.

  

  

C. Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations and
warranties and other agreements in connection with the Merger.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants and representations set

conditions of this Agreement and the Articles of Merger attached hereto as
Exhibit B (the "Articles of Merger") and in accordance with the applicable
provisions of Pennsylvania Law, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into

2.5 Directors and Officers. At the Effective Time, the directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be those persons who were the directors of Merger
Sub, in each case until their successors are elected or appointed and

Capital Stock owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent or of Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.

  

  

(e) Company Stock Options.

  

  

(i) Each In-the-Money Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted
automatically into the right to receive, upon the delivery to Company of an
Option Acknowledgment Form by the holder of such In-the-Money Company Option,
(A) the Company Option-Based Upfront Merger Consideration and (B) following
the Release Date and subject to and in accordance with Article 9 and the
Escrow Agreement, the Company Option-Based Escrow Consideration, if any. At
the Effective Time, all In-the-Money Company Options shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of an In-
the-Money Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the cash payment (if any) described in this
Subsection 2.6(e).

  

  

(ii) Each Out-of-the-Money Company Option, if any, outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and extinguished and no
consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

(f) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value,
of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged for one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall be a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing
ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(g) Company Shareholders Meeting; Dissenters' Rights.

  

  

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, Company shall
take all action necessary under all applicable Laws to call, give notice of
and hold a meeting of the holders of Company Capital Stock to vote on a
proposal to adopt this Agreement and to approve the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Company Shareholders
Meeting"), including the resolutions in substantially the form attached hereto
as Exhibit C (the "Company Shareholder Resolutions"), and shall submit such
proposal and the Company Shareholder Resolutions to such holders at the
Company Shareholders Meeting. The Company Shareholders Meeting shall be held
as promptly as practicable after the date hereof.

  

  

(ii) If, in connection with the Merger, any holders of Company Capital Stock
shall have demanded and perfected their dissenters' rights with respect to
such shares (the "Dissenting Shares") in accordance with Pennsylvania Law,
none of such Dissenting Shares shall be converted into a right to receive that
portion of the Merger Consideration and Escrow Consideration payable to the
holder of such Dissenting Shares as provided in Subsections 2.6(a) through
2.6(c), but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to Pennsylvania Law. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who,
pursuant to the provisions of Pennsylvania Law, becomes entitled to payment of
the fair value of such shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance
with Pennsylvania Law (but only after the value therefor shall have been
agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to Pennsylvania Law). In the event
that any holder of Company Capital Stock fails to make an effective demand for
payment or fails to perfect its appraisal rights or dissenters' rights as to
its shares of Company Capital Stock or any Dissenting Shares shall otherwise
lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then any such shares shall immediately
be converted into the right to receive the consideration issuable pursuant to
Subsections 2.6(a) through 2.6(c) in respect of such shares as if such shares
had never been Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall issue and deliver to the
Exchange Agent, at (or as promptly as reasonably practicable after) the
applicable time or times specified in Section 2.8, following the satisfaction
of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 2.8, the portion of the
Merger Consideration and Escrow Consideration to which such holder would have
been entitled under Subsections 2.6(a) through 2.6(c) with respect to such
shares (subject to the provisions of Sections 2.6 and 2.8). Company shall give
Parent prompt notice (and in no event more than five Business Days) of any
demand received by Company for appraisal of Company Capital Stock or notice of
exercise of a holder's of Company Capital Stock dissenters' rights in
accordance with Pennsylvania Law.

  

  

(iii) The Shareholders' Agent may elect to assume the defense of any
proceeding with respect to any appraisal of Company Capital Stock with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Parent (it being agreed by Parent that each of the
Designated Firms is per se reasonable) by giving notice to Parent of its
election to assume such defense no later than ten days after Company gives
Parent notice of any demand for appraisal of such Company Capital Stock. If
the Shareholders' Agent elects to assume the defense of any such proceeding,
it shall diligently conduct such defense. Except with Parent's prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed, Company shall not voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for
appraisal or exercise of dissenters' rights unless (A) such payment or offer
or settlement does not exceed that portion of the Merger Consideration and
Escrow Consideration otherwise payable to the holder of such Dissenting Shares
as provided in Subsections 2.6(a) through 2.6(c) and (B) Company and Parent
receive a full release of and from any other claims that may be made against
Company or Parent by the holder of such Dissenting Shares. Parent, Company and
the Shareholders' Agent shall cooperate in good faith with any proceeding with
respect to any appraisal of Company Capital Stock and each shall make
available all information reasonably requested by each other party for such
purposes.

Financial Statements. The Estimated Closing Certificate shall be used to

(ii) At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Company shall
deliver to Parent a definitive closing payment schedule (the "Closing Payment
Schedule") certified by the Chief Executive Officer of Company and the

VHS Payment and the aggregate amount of any VHS Payment payable to each such
Person; and (D) the name of each Person entitled to receive any Sale Bonus and
the aggregate amount of any Sale Bonus payable to each such Person. Company
and the Securityholders agree that the Merger qualifies as an "Acquisition"
within the meaning specified in the Company Articles of Incorporation and the
Closing Payment Schedule shall be prepared consistent with the liquidation
provisions set forth in the Company Articles of Incorporation. Parent, the
Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation and the Shareholders' Agent shall be
entitled to rely conclusively on the Closing Payment Schedule and shall have
no liability to any Securityholders if the Merger Consideration is distributed
in accordance with the Closing Payment Schedule.

  

  

(b) Payments at Closing. At the Closing, Parent and Merger Sub shall make or
cause to be made the following payments (which amount shall, in the aggregate,
equal the Estimated Merger Consideration), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds:

  

  

(i) first, to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Fund;

  

  

(ii) second, to the respective payees of Transaction Expenses, the amounts
specified in the Closing Payment Schedule;

  

  

(iii) third, to the Shareholders' Agent, an amount equal to the Agent Fund;
and

  

  

(iv) fourth, to the Exchange Agent, the Exchange Fund, for distribution to the
Securityholders in accordance with Section 2.7.

  

  

(c) Payment of Sale Bonuses and VHS Payments. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date, Parent shall pay or cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay to the respective payees of Sale Bonuses and VHS Payments
the amounts specified in the Closing Payment Schedule.

  

  

2.8 Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Exchange Agent. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a
reputable bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Shareholders'
Agent (it being agreed by the Shareholders' Agent that Parent's transfer agent
is per se reasonable) to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in
connection with the Merger to receive the funds from Parent to which the
Securityholders shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.6. Parent shall be
solely responsible for the fees and expenses of the Exchange Agent.

  

  

(b) Exchange Procedures.

  

 

  

(i) At least ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Company shall mail
or deliver to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the
"Certificates") representing outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock: (A)
a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon receipt of the Certificates by the Exchange
Agent, shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and
Company may reasonably specify, and shall contain the agreement and
acknowledgment of the holder of such Certificates that such holder approves
the appointment of the Shareholders' Agent and agrees to be bound by the
indemnification obligations contained in this Agreement and the provisions set
forth in Article 9 and the Escrow Agreement) (the "Letter of Transmittal");
(B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the applicable Per Share Upfront Merger Consideration and the
right to receive the applicable Per Share Escrow Consideration, and (C) a lost
certificate affidavit with respect to the Certificates in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit E (the "Lost Certificate Affidavit"). Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation (or the delivery of a duly executed Lost
Certificate Affidavit) to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents
as may be appointed by Parent, together with such Letter of Transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor as of the Effective Time the applicable Per Share Upfront Merger
Consideration and, following the Release Date, the applicable Per Share Escrow
Consideration and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that, prior to the
Effective Time, represented shares of Company Capital Stock will be deemed
from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the
right to receive the applicable Per Share Upfront Merger Consideration and,
following the Release Date, the applicable Per Share Escrow Consideration.

  

  

(ii) At least ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Company shall mail
or deliver to each holder of In-the-Money Company Options an Option
Acknowledgement Form. Upon surrender of an In-the-Money Company Option to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with an Option Acknowledgement Form, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such In-
the-Money Company Option shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
applicable portion of the Company Option-Based Upfront Merger Consideration
and, following the Release Date, the applicable portion of the Company Option-
Based Escrow Consideration. Until so surrendered, each outstanding In-the-
Money Company Option that, prior to the Effective Time, represented the right
to purchase shares of Company Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the right to receive
the applicable portion of the Company Option-Based Upfront Merger
Consideration and, following the Release Date, the applicable portion of the
Company Optioned-Based Escrow Consideration. The Exchange Agent shall be
required to make or cause to be made any payments of the applicable Upfront
Merger Consideration to holders of In-the-Money Company Options by depositing
such funds with the Surviving Corporation for distribution through its normal
payroll systems. For greater certainty, all payments to holders of In-The-
Money Company Options shall be made net of the applicable exercise price.

  

  

(c) Rights of Former Company Shareholders. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of Company shall be closed as to holders of Company Capital
Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and no transfer of Company
Capital Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until
surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.8,
each Certificate theretofore representing shares of Company Capital Stock
(other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to Subsection 2.6(d) or as to
Dissenting Shares) shall from and after the Effective Time represent for all
purposes only the right to receive the consideration provided in Subsections
2.6(a) through 2.6(c) in exchange therefor.

  

  

(d) Transfer of Ownership. If the cash payment of the Per Share Upfront Merger
Consideration and/or the Per Share Escrow Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that
the Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for transfer as described in the Letter of Transmittal.

  

  

(e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the Securityholders six months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any Securityholders who
have not previously complied with this Section 2.8 shall thereafter look only
to Parent for payment of their claim for the Upfront Merger Consideration.

  

  

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
2.8, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, any party
hereto or any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any person for
any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  

  

(g) Dissenting Shares. The provisions of this Section 2.8 shall also apply to
Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that the obligations
of Parent under this Section 2.8 shall commence on the date of loss of such
status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
for such shares the Per Share Upfront Merger Consideration and the right to
receive the Per Share Escrow Consideration in accordance with Article 9 and
the Escrow Agreement, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Subsections
2.6(a) through 2.6(c).

  

  

2.9 Escrow. In connection with the Closing, Parent, Company, the Shareholders'
Agent and the Escrow Agent shall have executed and delivered to the other the
Escrow Agreement in substantially the form set forth on Exhibit F (the "Escrow
Agreement"). At the Closing, Parent shall deliver or cause to be delivered the
Escrow Fund to pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this
Agreement.

  

  

2.10 Adjustment Procedure.

  

  

(a) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to
the Shareholders' Agent (i) a certificate (the "Closing Certificate") setting
forth Parent's calculation of the Merger Consideration as of the Closing Date,
including an itemized statement of the Closing Cash, Closing Debt, Sale
Bonuses, VHS Payments and Closing Working Capital and (ii) a balance sheet of
Company as of the Closing Date reflecting Parent's calculation of each of the
components of the Merger Consideration (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), which
shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with
Company's past practices used in preparing the Company Financial Statements.

  

  

(b) The Shareholders' Agent shall have 45 days from the date on which the
Closing Certificate and the Closing Balance Sheet have been delivered to it to
raise any objection(s) to the Closing Certificate or the Closing Balance
Sheet, by delivery of written notice to Parent setting forth such objection(s)
in reasonable detail (the "Disputed Items"). In the event that the
Shareholders' Agent shall not deliver any such objection(s) with respect to
the Closing Certificate or the Closing Balance Sheet within such 45-day
period, then the Closing Certificate shall be deemed final for purposes of
this Section 2.10. In the event that any such objection(s) are so delivered,
the Closing Certificate shall be deemed not final and Parent and the
Shareholders' Agent shall attempt, in good faith, to resolve the Disputed
Items and, if they are unable to resolve all of the Disputed Items within 30
days of delivery of such notice, shall, within five Business Days thereafter
(or such earlier date as mutually agreed), submit the Disputed Items to the
Independent Accounting Firm. Parent and the Shareholders' Agent shall provide
to the Independent Accounting Firm all work papers and back-up materials
relating to the Disputed Items requested by the Independent Accounting Firm to
the extent available to Parent or its Representatives or the Shareholders'
Agent or its Representatives. Parent and the Shareholders' Agent shall be
afforded the same opportunity to present to the Independent Accounting Firm
any material related to the Disputed Items and to discuss the issues with the
Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm will (i) resolve
only the outstanding Disputed Items and may not assign a value greater than
the greatest value claimed for any item by either party or smaller than the
smallest value claimed for any item by either party, and (ii) re-calculate the
Merger Consideration as of the Closing Date using the calculations set forth
in the Closing Certificate, as modified only by (A) the Independent Accounting
Firm's resolution of the outstanding Disputed Items and/or (B) the written
agreement of Parent and the Shareholders' Agent. The determination by the
Independent Accounting Firm, as set forth in a notice to be delivered to
Parent and the Shareholders' Agent within 30 days after the submission of the
Disputed Items to the Independent Accounting Firm, shall be final, binding and
conclusive on Parent, the Shareholders' Agent and all shareholders of Company.
The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm will be borne
by the party whose positions generally did not prevail in such determination,
as determined by such Independent Accounting Firm, or if the Independent
Accounting Firm determines that neither party could be fairly found to be the
prevailing party, then such fees, costs and expenses will be borne 50% by the
Shareholders' Agent (payable solely out of the Agent Fund) and 50% by Parent.

  

  

(c) At such time as the Closing Certificate shall become final in accordance
with Subsection 2.10(b), the Merger Consideration determined in accordance
with the final Closing Certificate (the "Final Merger Consideration") shall be
compared to the Estimated Merger Consideration. If the Estimated Merger
Consideration is greater than the Final Merger Consideration, the
Securityholders shall pay to Parent an amount equal to such excess. Any
payment to be made by the Securityholders pursuant to this Subsection 2.10(c)
shall be made, within five Business Days from the date that the Closing
Certificate is finally determined pursuant to Subsection 2.10(b), first by
release of such amount from the Agent Fund and, if necessary, from the Escrow
Fund. If the Final Merger Consideration is greater than the Estimated Merger
Consideration, Parent shall pay to the Securityholders an amount equal to such
excess within five Business Days from the date that the Closing Certificate is
finally determined pursuant to Subsection 2.10(b).

  

  

(d) No adjustment to the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.10
shall be considered a breach of any representation, warranty or other
provision of this Agreement. Parent shall not make any claim in respect of the
determination of the Merger Consideration or any item included within the
determination of the Merger Consideration other than in accordance with this
Section 2.10.

  

  

(e) The Shareholders' Agent and its accountants, lawyers and representatives
will be given full access at all reasonable times to (and shall be allowed to
make copies of) the books and records of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries and to any personnel of the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiaries reasonably requested by such persons, in each case solely in
connection with the determination of the Merger Consideration or any dispute
relating thereto. The rights of the Shareholders' Agent and the
Securityholders under this Agreement shall not be prejudiced by the failure of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to comply with
this Subsection 2.10(e).

  

  

(f) If, for any reason, Parent fails to deliver the Closing Certificate within
the time period required by Subsection 2.10(a), the Estimated Closing
Certificate delivered by Company to Parent prior to the Closing shall be
considered for all purposes of this Agreement as being Parent's "Closing
Certificate" and the Shareholders' Agent shall have all of its rights under
this Section 2.10 with respect to such certificate.

  

  

2.11 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. The Upfront Merger
Consideration and Escrow Consideration delivered upon the surrender for
exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of shares of Company Capital Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article 2.

  

  

2.12 Voting Agreements. Each director and each holder of more than 5% of the
outstanding Company Capital Stock, and their Affiliates, holding in the
aggregate at least (i) a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, (ii) 60% of the outstanding shares of the Series F Preferred Stock and
(iii) a majority of the outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock, shall
have executed and delivered to Parent a Voting Agreement concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement.

  

  

2.13 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon delivery of a
duly executed Lost Certificate Affidavit by the holder thereof, such
consideration into which the shares represented by such shares represented by
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall have been converted.

  

  

2.14 Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Shareholders' Agent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
(including, but not limited to, payments in respect of Sale Bonuses, VHS
Payments or In-the-Money Company Options) to any Securityholder such amounts,
if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such delivery
and payment under the Code or any provision of state, local, provincial or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that any amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Securityholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Shareholders' Agent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be. The Surviving Corporation may make such
payments and required withholdings through its normal payroll process. The
Shareholders' Agent shall be permitted to deposit any funds held in the Agent
Fund in respect of Sale Bonuses, VHS Payments or In-the-Money Company Options
with the Surviving Corporation, such amounts to be disbursed by the Surviving
Corporation through its normal payroll process.

  

  

2.15 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action. Each of Parent, Merger Sub
and Company will take all such reasonable and lawful action as may be
necessary or desirable to effectuate the Merger in accordance with this
Agreement as promptly as possible. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Company and Merger
Sub are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or
otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so
long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

  

  

ARTICLE 3

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

  

  

For purposes of this Article 3, any reference to "Company" means Company and
any predecessor(s) of Company, and, unless otherwise specified or reasonably
apparent from the nature of the context in which such term is used, also means
any of Company's Subsidiaries. In this Agreement, any reference to any event,
change, condition or effect being "material" with respect to any Person means
any material event, change, condition or effect related to the condition
(financial or otherwise), properties, assets (including intangible assets),
liabilities, business, operations or results of operations of such Person and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  

  

Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that the
statements contained in this Article 3 are true and correct, except as
disclosed in that section of the document of even date herewith delivered by
Company to Parent prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Schedule") corresponding to the Section or Subsection of
this Agreement to which any of the following representations and warranties
specifically relate.

  

  

3.1 Organization, Standing and Power, Subsidiaries and Investments.

  

  

(a) Organization, Standing and Power. Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. Company has the corporate power to own its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted and is duly authorized and
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. Company has made
available to Parent a true and correct copy of the Articles of Incorporation
(the "Company Articles of Incorporation"), and the Bylaws (the "Company
Bylaws"), or other charter documents, as applicable, of Company, each as
amended to date. Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of the
Company Articles of Incorporation or the Company Bylaws, except for any de
minimis violations related to the failure to give timely notices or other
similar immaterial violations.

  

  

(b) Company Subsidiaries. Part 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists
all Subsidiaries of Company (each, a "Company Subsidiary") and indicates as to
each the type of entity and its jurisdiction of organization. Company owns,
directly or indirectly through one or more Company Subsidiaries, all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of each Company Subsidiary and there are
no options, warrants, calls, rights, securities or agreements of any character
by which Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound, obligating Company or any
Company Subsidiary to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or redeem or cause to
be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any shares of capital
stock of any Company Subsidiary. Each Company Subsidiary is a corporation or
other Entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, with full corporate power or other
Entity authority to own its properties and to carry on its business as now
being conducted and is duly authorized and qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so qualified and
in good standing would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on such Company Subsidiary. Company has made available to Parent a true
and correct copy of the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws or other
organizational documents, as applicable, of each Company Subsidiary, each as
amended to date (collectively, the "Subsidiary Organizational Documents"). No
Company Subsidiary is in violation of any of the provisions of its Subsidiary
Organizational Documents. At the Effective Time, Company will own all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of VHS and there will be no options,
warrants, calls, rights, securities or agreements of any character by which
Company or VHS is bound, obligating Company or VHS to issue, deliver, sell,
repurchase or redeem or cause to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or
redeemed, any shares of capital stock of VHS.

  

  

(c) Company Investments. Other than the Company Subsidiaries, Company does not
directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest
in, any Entity.

  

  

3.2 Capital Structure.

  

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of Company consists of 70,000,000 shares of
Company Common Stock, of which there were issued and outstanding as of the
close of business on the date hereof, 25,930,866 shares, and 24,100,000 shares
of Company Preferred Stock, of which there were designated 19,700,000 shares
of Series F Preferred Stock and 4,400,000 shares of Series G Preferred Stock
on the date hereof. As of the date hereof, there were issued and outstanding
19,654,233 shares of Series F Preferred Stock, convertible into 19,654,233
shares of Company Common Stock, and 4,400,000 shares of Series G Preferred
Stock, convertible into 4,400,000 shares of Company Common Stock. All
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are free of any Liens other than
Permitted Liens, and are not subject to preemptive rights or rights of first
refusal created by statute, the Company Articles of Incorporation or the
Company Bylaws or any agreement to which Company is a party or by which it is
bound. As of the date hereof, there were 16,363,000 shares of Company Common
Stock reserved for issuance under Company's 2009 Stock Option Plan and
Company's 1999 Stock Option Plan (together, the "Company Option Plans"), of
which 13,338,937 shares were subject to outstanding options and 3,024,063
shares were reserved for future option grants. As of the date hereof, there
were no outstanding Company Warrants. Company has made available to Parent
true and complete copies of each form of agreement or stock option plan
evidencing outstanding Company Options. Except for the rights created pursuant
to this Agreement and the rights disclosed in the preceding three sentences,
there are no other options, warrants, calls, rights, securities or agreements
of any character to which Company is a party or by which it is bound,
obligating Company to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or redeem or cause to
be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any shares of Company
Capital Stock or obligating Company to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting
of, change the price of, or otherwise amend or enter into any such option,
warrant, call, right, security or agreement. All shares of Company Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Company Preferred Stock or upon exercise
of Company Options, will be, when issued pursuant to the respective terms of
such Preferred Stock or Company Options, duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable. All shares of outstanding Company Capital Stock
and rights to acquire Company Capital Stock were issued in compliance with all
applicable federal and state securities Laws.

  

  

(b) There are no contracts or agreements relating to voting, purchase or sale
of Company Capital Stock (i) between or among Company and any of its
shareholders, and (ii) to Company's knowledge, between or among any of

aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Company. There is no injunction, judgment, decree, order or regulatory
restriction imposed upon Company or any of Subsidiaries or any of their assets
or business, or, to the knowledge of Company, any of their directors or

each material federal, state, county, local or foreign governmental consent,
license, permit, grant, or other authorization of a Governmental Entity that
is required for the operation of Company's business (the "Company
Authorizations"), and all of such Company Authorizations are in full force and
effect, except where the failure to obtain or have any of such Company
Authorizations or where the failure of such Company Authorizations to be in
full force and effect would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Company. Company is not and has not been in material
violation of or default under, and no condition exists that with notice or the
lapse of time or both would constitute a material violation of or default
under such Company Authorizations. No proceeding is pending or, to the
knowledge of Company, threatened to revoke or limit any such Company
Authorizations. Company has complied with, is not in violation of, and has not
received any written notices of violation with respect to, any federal, state,
local or foreign Law with respect to the conduct of its business, or the
ownership or operation of its business, except for such violations or failures

Effect on Company.

Company's knowledge, the plants, property and equipment of Company that are
used in the operations of its business are in good operating condition and
repair, except where the failure to be in good operating condition or repair
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. All leases to which Company is a
party are in full force and effect and are valid, binding and enforceable with
respect to Company and, to Company's knowledge, are valid, binding and
enforceable and in full force and effect with respect to each other party
thereto, in either case except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or relating
to creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity (regardless of
whether asserted in a proceeding in equity or at law). Company has made
available to Parent true and correct copies of all leases with respect to any
Leased Real Property.

arising in the Ordinary Course of Business. There are no royalties, fees or
other payments payable by Company to any third party in excess of $100,000 in

fees or the filing of any responses to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
actions, documents, applications or certificates for the purposes of

retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits to any person, except as
required by applicable law; (ii) there has been no "prohibited transaction,"

with respect to any Company Employee Plan that would result in liability to
Company; (iii) each Company Employee Plan has been administered in accordance
with its terms and in compliance with the requirements prescribed by any and
all applicable statutes, rules and regulations (including, but not limited to,

all requisite governmental reports (which were true and correct in all
material respects as of the date filed) and has properly and timely filed and
distributed or posted all notices and reports to employees required to be
filed, distributed or posted with respect to each such Company Employee Plan,
except where the failure to do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

of the nature of the business conducted or presently proposed to be conducted

neither Company nor, to Company's knowledge, any other party is in breach or
default, and no event has occurred that with notice or lapse of time would
constitute a breach or default by Company or, to Company's knowledge, by any
such other party, or permit termination, modification or acceleration, under
such Material Contract, subject to such exceptions as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Company. Company is not a party to any oral contract or agreement that
would otherwise constitute a "Material Contract." Company has made available
to Parent true and correct copies of all Material Contracts.

or proposal made or submitted in connection with any Legal Proceeding relating
to the Merger under any Antitrust Law. In addition, except as may be
prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law and except as may be
reasonably required by a party to protect such party's confidential
information, in connection with any Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger
under any Antitrust Law, each of Company and Parent will permit authorized
representatives of the other party to be present at each meeting or conference
with a Governmental Entity relating to any such Legal Proceeding and to have
access to and be consulted in advance in connection with any document, opinion
or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with

take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary to effectuate the Merger and
make effective the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Parent shall not have any obligation under this Agreement to (i)
dispose or transfer or cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or transfer

operations or the future operations of Company. The Company shall not do,
agree to do, or commit to doing, any of the foregoing without Parent's prior
written consent, other than in the Ordinary Course of Business.

6.6 Employee Benefit Plans.

  

  

(a) Disqualified Individuals. Company shall set forth on Part 6.6(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule a list of all persons who Company reasonably
believes are, with respect to Company and as of the date of this Agreement,
"disqualified individuals" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder). Not later than five Business Days
prior to the expected Closing Date, Company shall revise Part 6.6(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule to reflect any additional information that Company
reasonably believes would impact the determination of persons who are, with
respect to Company and as of the each such date, "disqualified individuals"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder).

  

  

(b) Section 280G Agreement. Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain, prior to the Closing Date, a properly executed Section 280G Agreement
in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit G (the "280G Agreement")
from each person reasonably identified by Company or Parent as potentially
receiving excess parachute payments, as defined in Section 280G of the Code,
in connection with the Merger.

  

  

6.7 Notification of Certain Matters. Each of Company and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the other if any of the following occurs after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time: (a) receipt of any written
notice of, or other written communication relating to, a default or event
that, with notice or lapse of time or both, constitutes a material default
under any Material Contract; (b) receipt of any written notice or other
written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (c) receipt of any written notice or other written communication
from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; and (d) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact or
event that would reasonably be expected to cause any covenant, condition or
agreement hereunder not to be complied with or satisfied in any material
respect.

  

  

6.8 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (each, a
"Proceeding"), in which any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior
to the Closing, a manager, director, officer or Affiliate of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Persons") is, or is threatened to be, made
a party or witness thereto based in whole or in part on the fact that such
Person is or was a manager, director, officer or Affiliate of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, whether in any case asserted or arising before, on or
after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless such
Indemnified Person from and against any and all Damages (including advancement
of expenses) incurred in connection with or arising out of such Proceeding.

  

  

(b) An Indemnified Person shall notify the Surviving Corporation of the
existence of a Proceeding for which such Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification hereunder as promptly as reasonably practicable after such
Indemnified Person learns of such Proceeding; provided that the failure to so
notify shall not affect the obligations of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries under this Section 6.8 except to the extent such failure to
notify actually prejudices the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries. The
Indemnified Person and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall
cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense of any
Proceeding. No settlement of a Proceeding may be made by the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries without the Indemnified Person's
consent, except for a settlement that requires no more than a monetary payment
for which the Indemnified Person is fully indemnified and that does not
require the admission of liability. No settlement of a Proceeding may be made
by an Indemnified Person without the consent of the Surviving Corporation,
unless such consent is unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  

  

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain
Company's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance or purchase a
so-called "tail" for such directors' and officers' liability insurance, in
each case covering Persons who are currently covered by such insurance on
terms no less favorable than those in effect on the date hereof for a period
of at least three years after the Closing.

  

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and enforceable by, each Indemnified Person and such Indemnified Person's
estate, heirs and representatives, and nothing herein shall affect any
indemnification rights that any Indemnified Person or such Indemnified
Person's estate, heirs and representatives may have under the Company Articles
of Incorporation, Company Bylaws, Subsidiary Organizational Documents, any
Law, any contract or otherwise.

  

  

(e) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries under
this Section 6.8 shall continue in full force and effect for a period
commencing as of the Effective Time and ending as of the later of (i) the six-
year anniversary of the Closing and (ii) the date that all applicable statute
of limitation periods have expired for any claim or claims for which an
Indemnified Person may be entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.8;
provided that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim for
indemnification under this Section 6.8 asserted or made within such period
shall continue until the final disposition of such claim.

  

  

6.9 Books and Records. From and after the Closing, Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain a reasonable records retention policy. After
the Closing, the Shareholders' Agent and its accountants, lawyers and
representatives shall be entitled at all reasonable times to have access to
and to make copies of the books and records and other information of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries for any purpose relating to the
Securityholders' ownership of Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing including, without limitation, the preparation of Tax Returns. In the
event of any litigation or threatened litigation between the parties relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, the covenants
contained in this Section 6.9 shall not be considered a waiver by any party of
any right to assert the attorney-client privilege.

  

  

6.10 WARN Matters. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will, at any
time prior to 90 days after the Closing Date, effectuate a "plant closing" or
"mass layoff" as those terms are defined in WARN or any similar termination or
reduction in force under any Law.

  

  

6.11 Employment Benefits.

  

  

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Parent (in its sole
discretion) will either allow those individuals who continue their employment
with Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, following the Closing Date
(the "Continuing Employees") to join Parent's employee benefits plans, which
plans shall provide such Continuing Employees with levels and types of
benefits that are on substantially similar terms as those offered from time to
time to Parent's similarly situated employees, or will continue the Company
Benefit Plans in effect as of the Effective Time; provided, however, that no
provision in this Agreement shall limit in any way the right of Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of a Continuing Employee. In
addition, Parent has no present intention of decreasing materially the rates
of base salary of the Continuing Employees from the rates in effect as of the
Closing Date.

  

  

(b) To the maximum extent permitted by law, for the purposes of any of the
employee benefit and compensation plans, programs, policies and arrangements
of Parent (collectively, the "Parent Plans") for which eligibility or vesting
of benefits depends on length of service, and for any benefit for which the
amount or level of benefits depends on length of service, Parent shall give
(or cause to be given) to each Continuing Employee full credit for past
service with Company and/or its Subsidiaries as of and through the Closing
Date ("Prior Service") under the plans, programs, policies and arrangements of
Company and its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this Agreement
(collectively, the "Company Plans"). In addition, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, each Continuing Employee (i) shall be given credit for Prior
Service for purposes of eligibility to participate, satisfaction of any
waiting periods, evidence of insurability requirements, or the application of
any pre-existing condition limitations and (ii) shall be eligible to receive
under the Parent Plans such periods of vacation leave, sick leave, personal
days, holidays and other similar periods of leave as were accrued based upon
time in service and available to the employee under the Company Plans
immediately prior to the Closing.

  

  

6.12 Tax Covenants.

  

  

(a) Parent shall file a consolidated federal income Tax Return that includes
Company for the taxable period of Company starting with the day next following
the Closing Date. Accordingly, the taxable year of Company will close for
federal income Tax purposes at the end of the day on the Closing Date. No
election under Section 338 of the Code (relating to stock purchases treated as
asset acquisitions) or under Reg. §1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) (relating to ratable
allocation elections) shall be made. Company shall not engage in any
transactions on the Closing Date outside the Ordinary Course of Business other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties agree that
any deductions accrued by Company as of the Closing Date, including, without
limitation, with respect to the Sale Bonuses and payments in respect of In-
the-Money Company Options, are properly allocable to the portion of the
Closing Date prior to the Closing, and accordingly the "next day rule" of Reg.
§1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) is inapplicable. After the Closing, Company shall not
be merged or liquidated, or otherwise engage in a transaction to which Section
381 of the Code applies, prior to payment by Company of the amounts described
in Subsections 2.7(c) and 2.8(b)(ii) of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) The Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns of the Company and all of its Subsidiaries for Taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date that have not been filed prior to
the Closing Date and for all taxable periods that include but do not end on
the Closing Date. To the extent Company or any of its Subsidiaries incurs a
net operating loss or other Tax attribute for the taxable year ended on the
Closing Date, Company shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, carry back such net operating loss or
other Tax attribute and shall timely claim any refunds for Taxes as a result
of such carryback, including through amending Tax Returns. The Company shall
permit the Shareholders' Agent at least ten days to review and comment on each
such Tax Return described in this Subsection 6.12(b) and shall make such
revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the Shareholders'
Agent. All Tax Returns to be prepared by or for the Company pursuant to this
Subsection 6.12(b) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past
practice of the Company, which shall include tax accounting methods, except as
otherwise required by Law.

  

  

(c) After the Closing, all refunds or other amounts received or receivable by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates in respect of Taxes paid by Company or its Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing or in respect of any period or partial period ending on
or prior to the Closing shall be paid by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any Affiliate of Parent to the Shareholders' Agent for the benefit of the
Securityholders to the extent not reflected in the calculation of Closing
Working Capital; provided, however, that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any Affiliate of Parent shall be entitled to deduct from such refund or other
amount payable to the Shareholders' Agent the reasonable out of pocket costs
and expenses incurred by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and any Affiliate
of Parent to prepare any amendments to previously filed Tax Returns necessary
to obtain such refund or other amount payable to the Shareholders' Agent. No
such amounts shall be used or applied to pay Taxes that may be due in respect
of any subsequent period.

  

  

(d) Neither Parent, nor the Surviving Corporation nor any Affiliate of Parent
shall amend the Tax Returns of Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect
of Taxes paid prior to the Closing or in respect of any period or partial
period ending on or prior to the Closing without the prior written consent of
the Shareholders' Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  

  

(e) After the Closing Date, Company shall control the conduct, through counsel
of its own choosing, of any audit, claim for refund, litigation or other
proceeding involving any asserted Tax liability or refund with respect to
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each a "Proceeding"); provided, however,
that (i) the Shareholders' Agent shall have the right to participate in such
Proceeding at its own expense to the extent it relates to Taxable periods or
any portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) Parent
shall not allow Company to settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of
such Proceeding that could affect the Tax liability of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or prior to
the Closing date without the prior written consent of the Shareholders' Agent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In
the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Subsection 6.12(e)
and the provisions of Article 9, the provisions of this Subsection 6.12(e)
shall control.

  

  

(f) Each of the parties to this Agreement shall cooperate, to the extent
reasonably requested by another, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
and any audit, claim for refund, litigation, or other proceeding with respect
to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon another
party's request), the provision of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such Tax Return filing, audit, claim for refund, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. In the event of any dispute under this Section 6.12, the dispute
mechanism procedure set forth in Subsection 2.10(b) shall govern such dispute
mutatis mutandis.

  

  

(g) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, real property gains, stamp,
registration, and other such Taxes and fees incurred in connection with this
Agreement shall be paid when due 50% by the Securityholders (out of the Agent
Fund) and 50% by Parent, and Parent will, at its expense, file all necessary
Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such transfer,
documentary, sales, use, real property gains, stamp, registration, and other
Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable law, the Shareholders' Agent
(to the extent it is so authorized by this Agreement) will join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

  

  

6.13 Termination of Agreements. Prior to or contemporaneously with the
Effective Time, Company shall take all action that may be necessary to
terminate the agreements listed on Part 6.13 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and cause to be removed any Liens or other encumbrances securing
payments under such agreements.

Effective Time (with respect to Subsection 8.1(b) through Subsection 8.1(e),
by written notice by the terminating party to the other parties):

  

  

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and Company;

  

  

(b) by either Parent or Company if, without fault of the terminating party,
the Closing shall not have occurred on or before April 30, 2011, or such later
date as may be agreed upon in writing by the parties hereto (the "Final
Date"); provided, however, that the Final Date shall be extended to June 30,
2011, if the only reason the Closing shall not have occurred by April 30,
2011, is the failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.1(b) (although
such extension shall not occur if the failure of such conditions has been
caused or resulted from one party's action or failure to act constituting a
breach of this Agreement and the other party does not consent to such
extension); and provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Subsection 8.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose willful
and knowing action or failure to act has been the cause of or resulted in the
failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date and such action or
failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

  

  

(c) by Parent, (i) if any of Company's representations and warranties shall
not be true and correct, such that the condition set forth in Subsection
7.2(a) would not be satisfied, or any of Company's covenants contained in this
Agreement shall have been breached, such that the condition set forth in
Subsection 7.2(b) would not be satisfied and (ii) such inaccuracy, breach,
failure or misrepresentation has not been cured by Company within ten Business
Days after its receipt of written notice thereof (specifying in reasonable
detail such inaccuracy, breach, failure or misrepresentation) and remains
uncured at the time notice of termination is given;

  

  

(d) by Company, (i) if any of Parent's or Merger Sub's representations and
warranties shall not be true and correct, such that the condition set forth in
Subsection 7.3(a) would not be satisfied, or any of Parent's or Merger Sub's
covenants contained in this Agreement shall have been breached, such that the
condition set forth in Subsection 7.3(b) would not be satisfied and (ii) such
inaccuracy, breach, failure or misrepresentation has not been cured by Parent
or Merger Sub within ten Business Days after its receipt of written notice
thereof (specifying in reasonable detail such inaccuracy, breach, failure or
misrepresentation) and remains uncured at the time notice of termination is
given; or

  

  

(e) by either Parent or Company if a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Entity shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree or
ruling or taken any other action, in each case having the effect of
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, unless
the party relying on such order, decree or ruling or other action has not
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Agreement.

  

  

8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 8.1, there shall be no liability or obligation on the part
of Parent, Merger Sub or Company or their respective officers, directors or
shareholders, except to the extent that such termination results from the
intentional and knowing breach by a party hereto of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement, in which
event the terminating party will be entitled to exercise any and all remedies
available under law or equity in accordance with this Agreement; provided,
however, that the provisions of Section 6.2 (Confidentiality), this Section
8.2 and Article 10 (General Provisions) shall remain in full force and effect
and survive any termination of this Agreement.

(a) Survival. All representations and warranties of the parties contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by a party pursuant to this
Agreement shall (i) survive the Closing, notwithstanding any investigation
made by or on behalf of any party hereto and (ii) be deemed to be made as of
the date hereof and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent that a
representation or warranty expressly states that such representation or
warranty is as of a certain date) in each case, subject to the limitations set
forth in this Section 9.1. The representations, warranties and covenants
contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement and all indemnity obligations
in Subsection 9.1(b) shall terminate on, and no claim or action with respect
thereto or with respect to any indemnity obligations in Section 9.1(b) may be
brought after, the date that is the earlier of (A) 18 months after the Closing
Date and (B) December 15, 2012 (the earlier of such dates, the "Initial
Termination Date"); provided that the representations and warranties under
Subsections 3.2(a) (Capital Structure) and 3.3(a) (Authority) (the
"Fundamental Representations") and related indemnity obligations shall survive
until the expiration of the respective applicable statute of limitations for
each such item. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any
claim for Damages is asserted by any Parent Indemnified Person or any Seller
Indemnified Person in writing with reasonable specificity prior to the
termination of the representation, warranty, covenant or indemnification
obligation pursuant to this Section 9.1, the indemnification obligations set
forth in this Article 9 shall continue with respect to such claim until the
resolution thereof.

  

  

(b) Indemnification by Securityholders.

  

  

(i) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 9, the
Securityholders will severally (but not jointly) indemnify and hold harmless
Parent and the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers, directors,
employees and Affiliates (individually a "Parent Indemnified Person" and
collectively the "Parent Indemnified Persons") from and against any Damages
based upon, arising out of, or otherwise in respect of or that may be incurred
by virtue of or result from (as determined by an order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or by written agreement of Parent and the Shareholders' Agent):
(A) the inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by
Company in Article 3 or in any certificate delivered by Company hereunder,
provided, that, for purposes of this subsection (A) only, those
representations and warranties that are qualified by references to "material"
or "Material Adverse Effect" or words of similar effect of any Person (except
for the reference to "Material Adverse Effect" in Subsection 3.5(a) and the
reference to "in all material respects" in Section 3.4) shall be deemed not to
include such qualifications; (B) any non-fulfillment or breach of any pre-
Closing covenant made by Company in this Agreement; (C) any valid claim of any
nature by any of Company's shareholders or option holders regarding the Merger
or the termination of the Company Option Plan (other than claims for payments
this Agreement); (D) any amount payable in respect of any Dissenting Shares in
excess of the Merger Consideration attributable to such shares and any cost
and expenses defending any claim involving Dissenting Shares; or (E) any
liability of Company for (1) any Tax imposed on Company with respect to any
Tax period prior to the Effective Time or (2) any Tax of any other Person for
periods ending on or before the Effective Time imposed upon Company as a
result of Company being included prior to the Effective Time in a combined,
consolidated or unitary Tax group under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6
(or any similar provision of any other applicable Law) or, as a transferee or
successor, by agreement or otherwise. For purposes of this Subsection
9.1(b)(i), in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and
are payable for a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date, the portion of such Tax that relates to the pre-Closing period
shall (a) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to
income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period; and (b) in the
case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal
to the amount that would be payable if the relevant Taxable period ended on
the Closing Date. Any credits relating to a taxable period that begins before
and ends after the Closing Date shall be allocated on a basis consistent with
the allocations made pursuant to the preceding sentence. In connection with
any exercise by any Parent Indemnified Person of its rights hereunder, it
shall be entitled to make all claims for indemnification through, and deal
exclusively with, the Shareholders' Agent.

  

  

(ii) The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall
not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Effective Time,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

  

  

(c) Indemnification by Parent and the Surviving Corporation. Subject to the
other terms of this Article 9, from and after the Closing, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold each of the Securityholders and
the Shareholders' Agent and their respective officers, directors, employees
and Affiliates (each, a "Seller Indemnified Person" and collectively the
"Seller Indemnified Persons") harmless from all Damages incurred by them based
upon, arising out of, or otherwise in respect of or that may be incurred by
virtue of or result from (as determined by an order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or by written agreement of Parent and the Shareholders' Agent):
(i) the inaccuracy in or breach of any representation and warranty made by
Parent or Merger Sub in Article 4, or in any certificate delivered by Parent
or Merger Sub hereunder; (ii) any non-fulfillment or breach of any pre-Closing
covenant made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement; or (iii) any non-
fulfillment or breach of any post-Closing covenant made by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation in this Agreement. The Securityholders are intended
third party beneficiaries of this Subsection 9.1(c), and the Shareholders'
Agent shall have the right to enforce the provisions of this Subsection 9.1(c)
on behalf of the Securityholders.

  

  

(d) Limitations.

  

  

(i) No claim for any Damages asserted under Subsection 9.1(b) (other than the
Fundamental Representations) shall be made by a Parent Indemnified Person (A)
unless the amount of all Damages with respect to an individual claim exceeds
$25,000 (the "Individual Claim Threshold") and (B) until the aggregate amount
of all Damages (excluding claims for which indemnification is not available
because such claims do not exceed the Individual Claim Threshold) exceeds
$500,000 (the "Deductible"), in which event such Parent Indemnified Person
shall be permitted to make claims under this Article 9 for all such Damages
exceeding the Deductible. The Securityholders shall not be liable for Damages
under Subsection 9.1(b) (other than the Fundamental Representations) in excess
of the Escrow Fund (the "Escrow Limitation").

  

  

(ii) No Securityholder shall be liable for Damages pursuant to Subsection
9.1(b) in excess of the aggregate portion of the Merger Consideration actually
received by such Securityholder.

  

  

(iii) No Securityholder shall be liable for any Damage in excess of such
Securityholder's Pro Rata Share of such Damage.

  

  

(iv) No Parent Indemnified Person shall bring a claim in respect to Damages
arising out of any breach of the representations and warranties of Company in
this Agreement or any certificate delivered hereunder to the extent that a
corresponding reserve for such Damages has been made in the determination of
Merger Consideration.

  

  

(v) No Parent Indemnified Person shall initiate any claim unless such claim is
made against all Securityholders and no Parent Indemnified Person shall offer
to compromise any claim unless the same offer is made to all of the
Securityholders

  

  

(e) Exclusive Source. The sole and exclusive source of payment for any Damages
asserted under Subsection 9.1(b) (other than with respect to the Fundamental
Representations) shall be limited to the Escrow Fund (as reduced from time to
time in accordance with the Agreement).

  

  

(f) Third Party Claims.

  

  

(i) Any party entitled to make a claim for indemnification hereunder shall
promptly notify the indemnifying party of any third party claim in writing
upon learning of such claim or the facts constituting such claim, describing
the claim in reasonable detail, the amount thereof, and the basis therefor.
The indemnifying party will be relieved of its indemnification obligations
hereunder only to the extent that the defense of the third party claim is
materially prejudiced by the indemnified party's failure to give such prompt
notice. The party from whom indemnification is sought shall respond to each
such claim within 30 days of receipt of such notice. No action shall be taken
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement or otherwise by the party seeking
indemnification (unless reasonably necessary to protect the rights of the
party seeking indemnification) until the later of (A) the expiration of the
30-day response period or (B) 30 days following the expiration of the 30-day
response period if a response, received within such 30-day period by the party
seeking indemnification, requests an opportunity to cure the matter giving
rise to indemnification (and, in such event, the amount of such claim for
indemnification shall be reduced to the extent so cured).

  

  

(ii) Except as provided in Subsection 9.1(f)(iii), the indemnifying party may
elect to assume the defense of any third party claim with, at its own expense,
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, by giving written
notice to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of the
third party claim no later than ten Business Days after the indemnified party
gives notice of the assertion of a third party claim under Subsection
9.1(f)(i). If the indemnifying party elects to assume the defense of a third
party claim (A) it shall diligently conduct the defense and, so long as it
diligently conducts the defense, shall not be liable to the indemnified party
for any indemnified party's fees or expenses subsequently incurred in
connection with the defense of the third party claim other than reasonable
costs of investigation, and (B) the party claiming indemnification shall
cooperate fully with the indemnifying party and make available to the
indemnifying party all pertinent information under its control; provided that
the indemnified party may participate in any proceeding with counsel of its
choice at its expense. No compromise or settlement of such third party claim
may be effected by the indemnifying party without the indemnified party's
written consent unless (1) there is no finding or admission of any violation
by the indemnified party of any Law or any rights of any Person, (2) the
indemnified party receives a full release of and from any other claims that
may be made against the indemnified party by the third party bringing the
third party claim, and (3) the sole relief is monetary damages that are paid
in full from the Escrow Fund with respect to indemnification by the
Securityholders or are paid in full by Parent with respect to indemnification
by Parent.

  

  

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party determines in
good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a third party claim may
materially and adversely affect it or any Affiliate other than as a result of
monetary damages for which it would be entitled to relief under this
Agreement, the indemnified party may, by notice to the indemnifying party,
assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such third party
claim.

  

  

(iv) Each of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall cooperate
in good faith with the other party and shall make available to the other party
all pertinent information under its control and reasonably requested by the
other party. Such cooperation shall include, without limitation, (A) assisting
in the collection and preparation of discovery materials, (B) meeting with
(and making employees available to meet with) the indemnifying party and/or
its counsel to prepare for and/or appear as witnesses at depositions, court
proceedings and/or trial, and (C) providing to the indemnifying party and/or
its counsel all information under its control that is reasonably deemed
necessary by the indemnifying party and/or its counsel for the defense or
prosecution of such matter.

  

  

(g) Damages. In determining the amount of any Damages for which any Parent
Indemnified Person is entitled to assert a claim for indemnification
hereunder, the amount of any such Damages shall be determined after deducting
therefrom the amount of any insurance proceeds (after giving effect to any
applicable deductible or retention) and other third party recoveries actually
received by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in
respect of such Damages (which proceeds and recoveries Parent agrees to use
diligent efforts to obtain) and the amount of any Tax benefit related thereto.
If an indemnification payment is received by Parent, and Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries later receives insurance proceeds,
other third party recoveries or Tax benefits in respect of the related
Damages, Parent shall immediately pay to the Shareholders' Agent, for the
benefit of the Securityholders, a sum equal to the lesser of (i) the actual
amount of such insurance proceeds, other third party recoveries and Tax
benefits or (ii) the actual amount of the indemnification payment previously
paid by or on behalf of the Securityholders with respect to such Damages. For
purposes of this Subsection 9.1(g), the Tax benefit for a taxable year shall
equal the amount that the Parent Indemnified Person's liability for Taxes for
such taxable year, calculated by excluding any Tax items attributed to the
Damages, exceeds the Parent Indemnified Person's actual liability for Taxes
for such taxable year, calculated by taking into account any Tax items
attributed to the Damages, treating such Tax items attributable to the Damages
as the last items claimed for such taxable year. All parties shall use
commercially reasonably efforts to mitigate the amount of Damages for which
they may be entitled to indemnification hereunder.

  

  

(h) Subrogation. If (i) the Shareholders' Agent, on behalf of the
Securityholders, authorizes an indemnification payment hereunder, and (ii)
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries has or may have a
claim against a third party (including, without limitation, any insurer) in
respect of the related Damages, the Shareholders' Agent, on behalf of the
Securityholders, shall be subrogated to the rights and claims of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and such Subsidiaries, as the case may be, against such
third party. The Shareholders' Agent (on behalf of the Securityholders) shall
not, however, have the right to collect aggregate payments from such third
party or third parties in excess of the actual amount of the indemnification
payment previously paid with respect to such Damages. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation's Subsidiaries to,
execute and deliver to the Shareholders' Agent such documents and take such
other actions as may reasonably be requested in order to give effect to this
Section.

  

  

(i) Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. To the maximum extent permitted by
Law, it is the intention of the parties to treat any indemnity payment made
under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all
purposes, and the parties agree to file their Tax Returns accordingly.

  

  

9.2 Remedies Exclusive. The remedies provided in Article 9 shall be the sole
and exclusive remedies of the parties hereto and their Affiliates, heirs,
successors and assigns after the Closing with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby including, without limitation, any breach
or non-performance of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein, except in the case of actual fraud, in which case the
defrauded party shall have all rights and remedies available under this
Agreement and available under applicable Laws against the party that committed
such actual fraud. No party may bring or commence any claim, suit, action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, except to bring a claim for
(a) actual fraud against the party that committed such actual fraud, or (b)
indemnification in accordance with Section 9.1. The provisions of Article 9
constitute an integral part of the consideration given pursuant to this
Agreement and were specifically bargained for and reflected in the total
amount of the Merger Consideration payable to the Securityholders.

  

  

9.3 Escrow Period; Release From Escrow.

  

  

(a) Termination of Escrow. The Escrow Period shall terminate upon the Initial
Termination Date; provided, that a portion of the Escrow Fund that, in the
reasonable judgment of Parent subject to the objection of the Shareholders'
Agent is necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any
Officer's Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to termination of
the Escrow Period shall remain in the Escrow Fund until such claims have been
resolved.

  

  

(b) Release. Within three Business Days after the Initial Termination Date
(the "Release Date"), the Escrow Agent shall release from escrow to each
Securityholder who has complied with Section 2.8 the applicable Per Share
Escrow Consideration. The Escrow Consideration shall be determined by
deducting from the Escrow Consideration determined pursuant to Subsections
2.6(a) through 2.6(c), all amounts paid to Parent for indemnification pursuant
to this Article 9 and all amounts to be held in the Escrow Fund beyond the end
of the Escrow Period pursuant to Subsection 9.3(a). After the initial release
of the applicable Per Share Escrow Consideration, the applicable Per Share
Escrow Consideration shall be recalculated each time a portion of the Escrow
Fund is released to the Securityholders taking into consideration all amounts
paid to Parent for indemnification pursuant to this Article 9, all amounts to
be continued to be held in the Escrow Fund and all amounts previously paid to
the Securityholders. Any portion of the Escrow Fund held as a result of
Subsection 9.3(a) shall be released to the Securityholders or released to
Parent (as appropriate) promptly upon resolution of each specific
indemnification claim involved.

  

  

9.4 Claims Upon Escrow Fund. Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent on or before the
Release Date of a certificate of an officer of Parent (an "Officer's
Certificate") stating that Damages exist with respect to the indemnification
obligations of the Securityholders set forth in Section 9.1, and specifying in
reasonable detail the individual items of such Damages included in the amount
so stated, the date each such item was paid, or properly accrued or arose, and
the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or claim to
which such item is related, subject to Section 9.5 and the other provisions of
this Article 9, the Escrow Agent shall release proceeds from the Escrow Fund
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 9.5.

  

  

9.5 Objections to Claims.

  

  

(a) Written Notice. At the time of delivery of any Officer's Certificate to
the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such Officer's Certificate shall be
delivered to the Shareholders' Agent at the same time. For a period of 30 days
after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery of funds or other
property pursuant to Section 9.4 hereof unless the Escrow Agent shall have
received written authorization from the Shareholders' Agent to make such
delivery. After the expiration of such 30-day period, the Escrow Agent shall
make delivery of the funds or other property in the Escrow Fund in accordance
with Section 9.4 hereof, provided that no such payment or delivery may be made
if the Shareholders' Agent shall object in a written statement (the "Agent
Certificate") to the claim made in the Officer's Certificate, and such
statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent and to Parent prior to
the expiration of such 30 day period.

  

  

(b) Negotiation and Resolution. In case the Shareholders' Agent shall so
object in writing to any claim or claims by Parent made in any Officer's
Certificate, Parent shall have 30 days to respond in a written statement to
the objection of the Shareholders' Agent. If after such 30-day period there
remains a dispute as to any claims, the Shareholders' Agent and Parent shall
attempt in good faith for 60 days to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Shareholders' Agent and
Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both parties and shall be furnished to the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and
shall distribute the funds or other property from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms thereof.

  

  

9.6 Shareholders' Agent.

  

  

(a) Riverside Fund IV, L.P. and Sidney R. Knafel, acting together, shall be
irrevocably and exclusively authorized as the Securityholders' attorney, with
full power of substitution, to take all actions and make all decisions and
determinations on behalf of the Securityholders in respect of this Agreement,
any certificate, agreement or documents entered into by the Securityholders
pursuant to this Agreement, and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. Without limiting the generality of the prior sentence, the
Shareholders' Agent shall be exclusively authorized to (i) negotiate, execute
and deliver all amendments, modifications and waivers to this Agreement or
such certificates, agreements and documents; (ii) take all actions on behalf
of the Securityholders in connection with any claims or disputes with respect
to this Agreement, such certificates, agreements and documents, and/or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; (iii) to initiate, prosecute,
defend and/or settle such claims and disputes; (iv) to authorize payments from
the Agent Fund; and (v) to take all actions and sign all documents necessary,
convenient or advisable to accomplish any of the foregoing. No Securityholders
shall be permitted to take any such actions without the prior written approval
of the Shareholders' Agent. This power of attorney is deemed coupled with an
interest and shall survive the death, incapacity, disability, termination,
liquidation, dissolution or any other event affecting any Securityholder.

  

  

(b) The Shareholders' Agent will not receive a fee for serving as the
representative of the Securityholders hereunder. The Shareholders' Agent shall
be entitled to engage counsel, accountants and other advisors, and the fees
and expenses of such counsel and advisors and any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Shareholders' Agent may be paid from the Agent Fund or from
any other payment received hereunder by the Shareholders' Agent, in its
capacity as such.

  

  

(c) The Shareholders' Agent shall not be liable to any Securityholder for any
action taken by the Shareholders' Agent pursuant to this Agreement, and the
Securityholders shall severally, and not jointly, in proportion to their
respective Pro Rata Shares, indemnify and hold the Shareholders' Agent
harmless from and against any and all Damages arising out of or relating to
the Shareholders' Agent serving in this capacity, except in each case if and
to the extent a court of competent jurisdiction has finally determined (from
which no appeal may be taken) that the Shareholders' Agent has engaged in
willful misconduct.

  

  

(d) The Shareholders' Agent is serving in this capacity solely for purposes of
administrative convenience. The Shareholders' Agent, as such, is not
personally liable for any of the obligations of the Securityholders hereunder,
and the Parent Indemnified Persons agree that they will not look to the
underlying assets of the Shareholders' Agent for the satisfaction of any
obligations of the Securityholders.

  

  

(e) Any Person serving as the Shareholders' Agent hereunder may resign from
such role upon at least ten days prior written notice to the other Persons
then serving as the Shareholders' Agent and Parent. The Securityholders
holding a majority of the Pro Rata Shares may appoint a replacement. All
rights of any Person serving at any time as the Shareholders' Agent to
indemnification and exculpation hereunder shall survive such resignation.

  

  

(f) Parent acknowledges that the Shareholders' Agent may have a conflict of
interest with respect to its duties as Shareholders' Agent, and in such regard
the Shareholders' Agent has informed Parent that the Shareholders' Agent will
act in the best interests of the Securityholders.

  

  

(g) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders' Agent shall
constitute a decision of all the Securityholders and shall be final, binding
and conclusive upon each such Securityholder, and the Escrow Agent and Parent
may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders'
Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every
such Securityholder. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any
liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders' Agent.

  

  

(h) The Agent Fund will be held or disbursed, in whole or in part, as
determined in good faith by the Agent. The retention by the Shareholders'
Agent of any amounts in the Agent Fund shall not be used as evidence that the
Securityholders have any obligation hereunder. Any payment received by the
Shareholders' Agent, in its capacity as such, pursuant to this Agreement may
be used at the Shareholders' Agent's discretion to increase the Agent Fund.
The Shareholders' Agent shall be permitted to make any disbursements of
amounts in the Agent Fund in the amounts and at the times that it determines
in good faith. The Shareholders' Agent shall be permitted to deposit any funds
to be disbursed out of the Agent Fund with the Exchange Agent, if then still
engaged to handle disbursements of Merger Consideration, or the Surviving
Corporation for distribution through its normal payroll systems.

10.3 Amendment. The provisions of this Agreement may be modified, amended or

hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made

and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the

to exercise and no delay in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder

10.5 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Exhibits or
Schedules, such reference shall be to an Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. The words "include," "includes" and "including"
when used herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The phrase "made available" in this Agreement means that
the information referred to has been made available if requested by the party
to whom such information is to be made available. The phrases "the date of
this Agreement," "the date hereof," and terms of similar import, unless the
context otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to January 15, 2011.
Unless otherwise specified, any references to any Law shall be construed as a
reference thereto as amended, restated or supplemented from time to time and
any reference to this Agreement or any other document is a reference to this
Agreement or such other document as amended, restated or supplemented from
time to time and includes all schedules and exhibits thereto. Unless otherwise
specified herein, any reference to "dollars" or "$" or other dollar amounts in
this Agreement shall mean the lawful currency of the United States. When
calculating the period of time within which or following which any act is to
be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the
reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded. If the last day
of such period is a non-Business Day, the period in question shall end on the
next Business Day. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

10.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all

application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of law. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the

for the District of Delaware) in connection with any matter based upon or
arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, agrees that
process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the
State of Delaware for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or
plead any objection that they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction,
venue, convenience of forum and service of process. EACH PARTY HERETO
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE, IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY
HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR

this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

intended third party beneficiaries of and shall be permitted to rely on

provision hereof. No Continuing Employee shall be a third party beneficiary or
entitled to rely on any provision of this Agreement.

  

  

10.12 Schedules. Information set forth in any part of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed to qualify each Section of this Agreement to which
such information is applicable (regardless of whether or not such Section is
qualified by reference to a part of the Company Disclosure Schedule), so long
as application to such Section is reasonably discernible from the reading of
such disclosure. No information set forth on any part of the Company
Disclosure Schedule hereto shall be deemed to broaden in any way the scope of
Company's representations and warranties. The inclusion of an item on any part
of the Company Disclosure Schedule hereto is not evidence of the materiality
of such item for purposes of this Agreement or otherwise, or that such item is
a disclosure required under the Agreement. Any description of any agreement,
document, instrument, plan, arrangement or other item set forth on any part of
the Company Disclosure Schedule hereto is a summary only and is qualified in
its entirety by the terms of such agreement, document, instrument, plan,
arrangement or item, true and correct copies of which have been made available
to Parent. No disclosure in any part of the Company Disclosure Schedule hereto
relating to any possible breach or violation of any agreement, Company
Authorization or Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any
such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred, or shall constitute
an admission of liability to any third party.

hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that: (a) each of the Shareholders'
Agent and the Securityholders shall have the right to retain Choate, Hall and

represent their respective interests in any dispute arising under or in
connection with this Agreement, any agreement entered into pursuant to this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (a "Dispute");

consents to and covenants not to assert any objection, based on conflict of
interest or otherwise, to any representation of the Shareholders' Agent or any
Securityholder by a Designated Firm in any Dispute; (c) all communications
between any of the Securityholders, Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives, on the
one hand, and a Designated Firm, on the other hand, made in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and closing under, or any
dispute arising in connection with, this Agreement or otherwise relating to
any potential sale of Company (the "Protected Seller Communications"), shall
be deemed to be privileged and confidential communications; (d) all rights to
such Protected Seller Communications, and the control of the confidentiality
and privilege applicable thereto, shall be retained by the Shareholders'
Agent; and (e) to the extent Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) should discover in its possession after the Closing any
Protected Seller Communications, such party shall take reasonable steps to
preserve the confidentiality thereof and promptly deliver the same to the
Shareholders' Agent, keeping no copies, and shall not by reason thereof assert
any loss of confidentiality or privilege protection.
