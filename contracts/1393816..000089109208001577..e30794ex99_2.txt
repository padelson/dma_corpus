--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                           the employment agreement term sheets with HPV
                           partners), to maintain an aggregate investment in

                           proceeds received at the Closing (not including any
                           proceeds resulting from third party financing) minus
                           any tax liability owed as a result of receipt of the
                           Seller Note, multiplied by (B) 75%, (the "Required
                           Amount"), until the third anniversary of the Closing
                           (the "Cash Lock-up Period").

                       o   HPV's organizational documents will specify that,
                           during the Cash Lock-up Period, funds that constitute
                           the Required Amount will be subject to full
                           management fees and to the payment of 30% of
                           incentive fees (the latter of which will be allocable
                           exclusively to AAMAC). Pre-transaction capital
                           (including family investments) invested in Halcyon
                           Funds will count toward the Required Amount as long
                           as it is subject to the foregoing fee arrangements.
                           Amounts invested by Halcyon employees outside of
                           Required Amounts will continue to be invested on a
                           no-fee basis.

                       o   HPV's organizational documents will specify that,
                           during the Cash Lock-up Period, HPV partners will be
                           permitted to withdraw net appreciation as well as
                           amounts needed to satisfy quarterly income tax
                           payments. HPV partners will be permitted to withdraw
                           the full amount upon death/disability or

                           involuntary termination without cause or resignation
                           for good reason. Each HPV partner will determine the
                           allocation of the Required Amount among Halcyon Funds
                           but, with the exception of those partners who are

                           actively managed hedge funds, absent compelling
                           reason, each partner will allocate at least 65% of
                           such HPV partner's Required Amount to the strategy
                           for which such HPV partner has primary
                           responsibility.

                       o   HPV shall not amend such sections of its organization
                           documents without the consent of AAMAC, as approved
                           by the independent directors of AAMAC

                           incorporate the

                           above consent and supermajority provisions effective
                           as of the closing.

Registration Rights
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Founders and HPV       o   The Founders and HPV are entitled to certain
Registration Rights        registration rights for their Founders' Common Stock,
                           Sponsors' Warrants, AAMAC common stock underlying
                           Sponsors' Warrants and Founders Performance Warrants,
                           AAMAC common stock or the AAMAC common stock
                           underlying Exchangeable Shares, respectively (the
                           "Registrable Securities"). This agreement shall
                           replace the Founders' existing Registration Rights
                           Agreement with AAMAC.

                       o   Registration rights will accommodate the exchange
                           mechanism so that the HPV or the HPV partners will
                           not be required to effect the exchange before
                           registration becomes available for sales.

                       o   All registration rights are subject to the provisions
                           regarding transfer restrictions, above.

                       o   All expenses of the registered offerings pursuant to
                           exercise by the Founders or HPV of their registration
                           rights shall be paid by AAMAC (other than
                           underwriting discounts and commissions with respect
                           to underwritten offerings). In connection with each
                           Demand Registration and Piggyback Registration, AAMAC
                           shall reimburse the Founders and HPV for the
                           reasonable fees and disbursements of their counsel.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Demand Rights   o   Availability: The Founders (as a group) and HPV,
                           acting either individually or together, may issue to
                           AAMAC a written request (a "Demand Notice") that
                           AAMAC effect the registration of all or any portion
                           of such party's Registrable Securities (a "Demand
                           Registration"). Demand Registration of the
                           Registrable Securities shall be available beginning
                           twelve months after the closing date (or on the
                           closing date in the case of the Sponsors' Warrants
                           and the AAMAC common stock underlying the Sponsors'
                           Warrants; and provided that the request for such
                           registration may be submitted at any time following
                           the ninth month following the closing date, without
                           accelerating AAMAC's obligation to effect a
                           registration statement before the 12 month period
                           above), and only if there is no shelf registration
                           statement in effect. During every twelve month
                           period, the Founders (as a group) shall be entitled
                           to one demand and HPV shall be entitled to two

                           demands, provided that the Demand Notice relates to
                           Registrable Securities equal to or greater than
                           $5,000,000 in the aggregate (or $1,000,000 in the
                           case of a Demand Notice with respect to the Sponsors'
                           Warrants and the AAMAC Common Stock underlying the
                           Sponsors' Warrants) (the "Minimum Amount"). The right
                           to make demands shall be suspended at any time when a
                           shelf registration statement is available.

                       o   Withdrawal: The demanding party may withdraw the
                           Demand Notice at any time prior to the effective date
                           of the registration statement filed in response to
                           such Demand Notice. AAMAC shall be responsible for
                           all expenses relating to Demand Registration.

                       o   Postponement: Upon notice to the demanding party,
                           AAMAC may postpone effecting a Demand Registration on
                           one occasion during any period of six consecutive
                           months if AAMAC has determined in good faith that
                           effecting the registration would materially and
                           adversely affect AAMAC, provided that such
                           postponement shall be for the shortest possible
                           period of time determined in good faith by AAMAC but
                           not exceeding 30 days (which period may not be
                           extended or renewed).

                       o   Registration Statement: AAMAC must file a
                           registration statement within 60 days of the Demand
                           Notice (except as noted in the first bullet above),
                           and must maintain the effectiveness of such statement
                           until all Registrable Securities to which the Demand
                           Notice relates are disposed, to a maximum of 180 days
                           (extended for any period during which a stop order,
                           injunction, etc. was in effect). The registration
                           statement shall be on such appropriate registration
                           form of the SEC as shall be selected by AAMAC,
                           subject to the consent of the HPV or the Founder.

                       o   Underwriter: The demanding party may elect to have an
                           underwritten offering, and are entitled to select the
                           underwriter.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Piggyback Rights   o   Availability: The Founders and HPV shall have
                           unlimited piggyback rights, provided that they shall
                           have no piggyback rights for Form S-8 or S-4
                           registrations (and successor forms).

                       o   Notice: AAMAC shall give notice of an intended
                           registered offering to the Founders and HPV as soon
                           as practicable, but
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           no less than 15 days prior to anticipated filing
                           date.

                       o   Cutbacks: Cutbacks will be permitted in an
                           underwritten offering if the underwriter determines
                           in good faith that selling the number of shares
                           requested to be included in the offering would
                           materially and adversely affect AAMAC's ability to
                           sell the shares at the desired offering price. If the
                           offering is for AAMAC's account, then priority will
                           be given to the shares being sold by AAMAC, then to
                           the Founders and HPV (pro rata based on the number of
                           shares that each elects to include in the
                           registration), then to other holders of AAMAC shares.
                           If the offering is initiated for the account of AAMAC
                           shareholders other than Founders and HPV, priority
                           shall be to those shareholders, then to the Founders
                           and HPV (pro rata based on the number of shares that
                           each elects to include in the registration), then to
                           the shares being sold by AAMAC. If the offering is
                           initiated by HPV or the Founders pursuant to a Demand
                           Notice, then priority shall be to the demanding
                           party, then to the non-demanding party (i.e. HPV or
                           the Founders), then to shares being sold by AAMAC,
                           and then to other shareholders; provided that in the
                           case of a demand by either party with respect to
                           which the other party has exercised piggyback rights,
                           if the underwriter has determined there should be a
                           cutback, the party exercising piggyback rights may
                           convert its piggyback election to a demand, such that
                           the converting party and the demanding party will be
                           treated pro rata in such cutback (based on the number
                           of shares that each elects to include in the
                           registration); provided further that the conversion
                           of election shall be counted as a demand.

                       o   Underwriting Terms: AAMAC to require underwriter to
                           include Registrable Securities in offering on same
                           terms and conditions as AAMAC shares.

                       o   Withdrawal: The Founders and HPV may withdraw from a
                           piggyback registration at any time. AAMAC shall be
                           responsible for all expenses (other than underwriting
                           discounts and commission in the case of an
                           underwritten offering).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Shelf Rights   o   Availability: Shelf registration rights shall be
                           available to the Founders (as a group) and HPV for
                           their Registrable Securities after such time as AAMAC
                           becomes S-3 eligible and no earlier than twelve
                           months after the closing date. The number and
                           frequency of takedown demands (a "Shelf Notice") to
                           which the Founders (as a group) and HPV are

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           entitled shall be the same as the entitlement for
                           demand registrations. The Founders and HPV must
                           demand shelf registration for a number of Registrable
                           Securities equal to or greater than $5,000,000 (or
                           $1,000,000 in the case of a Shelf Notice with respect
                           to the Sponsors' Warrants and the AAMAC Common Stock
                           underlying the Sponsors' Warrants). Notwithstanding
                           the foregoing 12 month limitation, the Sponsors'
                           Warrants and the AAMAC common stock underlying the
                           Sponsors' Warrants shall be registrable on any
                           earlier shelf registration statement that AAMAC makes
                           available to holders of public warrants following
                           closing.

                       o   Suspension: AAMAC may suspend the shelf registration
                           statement for a maximum of 60 days in succession or
                           120 days in aggregate in any 12 month period if it
                           would become necessary to disclose a financing,
                           acquisition, corporate reorganization or other
                           similar transaction or event, the disclosure of which
                           at such time would be materially detrimental to
                           AAMAC. The required term of the effective period of
                           the shelf shall be extended to account for the period
                           of time during which the shelf was suspended.

                       o   Effectiveness: AAMAC must file a shelf registration
                           statement within 60 days of receipt of a Shelf
                           Notice, and must use reasonable best efforts to have
                           such statement declared effective within 90 days of
                           filing. The registration statement shall be kept
                           continuously effective.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charter and Bylaws     o   The parties shall take or cause to be taken all
                           lawful action necessary to ensure at all times as of
                           and following the Closing Date that the certificate
                           of incorporation and by-laws of AAMAC and Halcyon are
                           not inconsistent with the provisions of this
                           agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Termination            o   Agreement shall terminate on the date that (a) HPV
                           and the HPV partners no longer hold any Exchangeable
                           Shares or AAMAC Common Stock and (b) Founders no
                           longer hold any AAMAC Common Stock or AAMAC warrants.

                                   Schedule A


Exchangeable Shares held indirectly by the partners of HPV (the "HPV Units")
will vest, with respect to such partner, as follows:

1.    20% of each HPV partner's HPV Units (100% in the case of any HPV Units
      resulting from a cash shortfall adjustment or the adjustment related to
      price targets) will vest immediately, with the remainder to vest in equal
      annual installments over the first five anniversaries of the Closing.
      Unvested HPV Units shall vest in full upon death, disability, termination
      without "cause," resignation for "good reason," a cessation of employment
      at the end of the term of the employment agreement following a notice of
      non-renewal by the employer (a "Non-Renewal"), or a change of control of
      Opco (each, a "Qualifying Event"), provided that HPV will have the power
      to decide that termination without "cause," resignation for "good reason,"
      cessation of employment due to a Non-Renewal or change of control is not a
      Qualifying Event in the case of a HPV partner other than the initial chief
      executive officer. If HPV exercises such power, each HPV partner's
      unvested HPV Units shall continue to vest in accordance with the vesting
      schedule set forth above. Unvested HPV Units will be forfeited upon a
      termination with "cause" or a resignation without "good reason" (as such
      terms are defined in the HPV partners' employment agreements).

2.    HPV Units, whether or not vested, are not transferable, subject to the
      limited exceptions for certain permitted transferees described below.

3.   Vested HPV Units can be exchanged for shares of AAMAC common stock, which
     can be sold or otherwise transferred in accordance with applicable
     securities laws, subject to the following two contractual restrictions
     (which are not applicable to AAMAC shares representing any vested HPV Units
     resulting from a cash shortfall adjustment, provided that such shares are
     subject to certain transfer restrictions set forth in the Purchase
     Agreement):

            o     Until the first anniversary of the Closing, each HPV partner
                  is not permitted to transfer AAMAC shares representing more
                  than 5% of his or her vested HPV Units. This prohibition
                  expires upon a Qualifying Event.

            o     Until the fifth anniversary of the Closing, each HPV partner
                  is not permitted to transfer AAMAC shares representing more
                  than 75% of his or her vested HPV Units. This prohibition
                  expires upon a Qualifying Event.

4.    Vested and unvested HPV Units or AAMAC shares that are subject to the
      foregoing restrictions may be transferred (without consideration) with the
      consent of the management of HPV, not to be unreasonably withheld, to:
      members of the family or charitable donees of each HPV partner, other
      partners of HPV who are then actively engaged in Halcyon's business or
      accounts beneficially owned by or for the benefit of the foregoing, as
      long as such transferees are subject to the same vesting and transfer
      restrictions that would have applied to the transferring HPV partner in
      the absence of such transfer and will not have any governance rights.
