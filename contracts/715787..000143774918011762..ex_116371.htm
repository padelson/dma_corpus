Moreover, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Parties understand and agree that, as used in this Agreement, "reasonable best
efforts" shall not require the Purchasers to participate in any contentious
litigation proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, involving any
Merger Control Authority in any country to (i) oppose or defend against any
action by any such Merger Control Authority to prevent or enjoin the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii)
overturn any action by any such Merger Control Authority to prevent
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including by defending any suit, action, or other legal proceeding brought by
any such Merger Control Authority in order to avoid the entry of, or to have
vacated, overturned or terminated or appealing any order to prevent the
Parties from consummating any transaction contemplated by this Agreement ("
**Contentious Litigation Proceeding** "). The Parties agree that judicial or
administrative proceedings that merely seek approval or entry of a consent
order or settlement agreement, or similar device, negotiated by the Purchasers
with a Merger Control Authority, would not be considered a "Contentious
Litigation Proceeding."

In connection with the efforts referenced in Section 7.1.1 and Section 7.1.2,
each Party shall (i) consult and cooperate in all respects with each other
Party in connection with any filings or submissions or in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry by any Merger Control Authority, including by
allowing each Party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and
comment on any of the other Party's drafts of any notifications, filings, or
submissions (if necessary or desirable on an outside counsel only basis); (ii)
each Party shall promptly inform the other Party of any communication received
by such Party from, or given by such Party to, the United States Department of
Justice's Antitrust Division (the " **DOJ** "), the Federal Trade Commission
(the " **FTC** "), the German Federal Cartel Office ( _Bundeskartellamt_ ) ("
**FCO** "), or any other Merger Control Authority, by promptly providing
copies to the other Party of any such written communications, in each case
regarding any transaction contemplated in this Agreement provided, however,
that materials may be redacted (A) to remove references concerning any
valuation of the Purchasers, the Target Group Companies, or any of their
Affiliates, (B) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (C)
as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns or
safeguard competitively sensitive information during the period prior to
Closing; and (iii) permit the other Party to review in advance any
communication that it gives to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting, substantive telephone call or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC, the
FCO, or any other Merger Control Authority, and to the extent permitted by the
DOJ, the FTC, the FCO, or any other Merger Control Authority, give the other
Party the opportunity to attend and participate in any in-person meetings with
the DOJ, the FTC, the FCO, or any other Merger Control Authority.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the Purchasers shall lead all
communications and strategy, on behalf of the Parties, relating to the pre-
merger notification inquiries, investigations, or proceedings involving Merger
Control Authorities, provided that Target Group Companies are not constrained
from complying with applicable Law.

In no event shall the Sellers agree or cause or permit any Target Group
Company to agree, unless the Purchasers so direct it, to (i) divest, license,
hold separate or otherwise dispose of, any portion of its respective
businesses, assets, or contracts or (ii) take any other action that may be
required, requested, or proposed by any Merger Control Authority in connection
with obtaining the consents, authorizations, orders or approvals required for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that, the Purchasers shall agree, to the extent necessary, to make
the divestitures specifically described below in Section 7.2.

7.1.5

 \t\t\t \t\t\t|  \t\t\t

The Purchasers shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain clearance
under any applicable foreign trade proceedings by the competent authorities in
Germany (the " **Foreign Trade Authority** "). The Purchasers, however, shall
duly apply (if required also on behalf of the Sellers) for a clearance
certificate ( _Unbedenklichkeitsbescheinigung_ ) or any other approval of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement by the Foreign Trade Authority no
later than five Business Days after the date of this Agreement. Sections 7.1.1
to 7.1.3 shall apply _mutatis mutandis_.

accept any such restriction, condition (including any divestiture condition)

any thereof on the Purchasers, any of their Affiliates and/or any Target Group
Company shall not be deemed to satisfy the Closing Condition in Section 11.1.

7.2.3

 \t\t\t \t\t\t|  \t\t\t

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if despite the Parties' use of their respective
reasonable best efforts to obtain all required consents, clearances and
approvals without any restriction, condition (including any divestiture
condition) or liability, a Merger Control Authority remains unwilling to grant
a required consent, clearance or approval unless the Parties agree to
divestiture obligations, then as the only exception to the general rule set
forth in Section 7.2.1, if required as the only condition to obtain such
consent, clearance or approval, the Purchasers undertake to agree to accept
divestiture obligations that in the aggregate involve divestitures after
Closing, within a period and on other terms required by the relevant Merger
Control Authorities, of specific assets or business operations of the
Purchasers, their Affiliates and/or the Target Group Companies,

Companies on a combined consolidated basis, nor have a fair market value, in
each case of EUR 35,000,000 (or local equivalent) or more in the aggregate
outside the United States, and (ii) have not generated any revenues of the

Affiliates, or any of the Target Group Companies, nor (ii) have collectively
generated during the most recent fiscal year an annualized revenue of the
Purchasers, their Affiliates, and Target Group Companies on a combined

For purposes of this Section 7.2.2, revenue will be deemed to be generated in
a particular country or jurisdiction if, under the accounting methods used by
the Purchasers or the relevant Target Group Company in the ordinary course of
business, revenues would be booked as sales within that particular country or
jurisdiction. Similarly, an asset will deemed to be located within the country
in which the asset is physically located or, if an intangible asset, the
country in which the corporate entity that claims that asset on its balance
sheet resides.

discovering all material underlying information relating to a Breach of
Warranty, describing in reasonable detail the facts or circumstances that give
rise to the Breach of Warranty and (to the extent known by the Purchasers) a
good faith estimate of the monetary value of the claim.

  



  

The Purchasers shall allow, and shall cause the Target Group Companies to
allow, the Sellers and their respective accountants and their respective

reasonable time period, provide such information and assistance as the Sellers
or their accountants or professional advisors may reasonably request in order
to evaluate the Warranty Claim.

  



  

No delay in or failure to provide such written notice or co-operation as set
forth above will limit or adversely affect the Purchasers' rights or remedies
in connection with a Warranty, except and to the extent such delay or failure
has materially prejudiced the Sellers' rights with respect to such Warranty
Claim or materially limited the ability of the Sellers to reduce the Loss.

This Agreement (including all Exhibits and Schedules hereto) contains the

and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings with respect thereto
except as expressly provided otherwise herein. This Agreement or any of its
provisions (including this Section 26.1) may be amended, waived or terminated
only by written instrument (or any stricter form required by mandatory Law)
executed by both Parties and explicitly referring to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Section 25.1,
Section 25.2.1(b) or this Section 26.1 (and any provision of this Agreement to
the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such provision would
modify the substance of Section 25.1, Section 25.2.1(b) or this Section 26.1)

may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer in whole or in part any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other Party, except for the assignment of rights or claims pursuant to
this Agreement by the Purchasers as security to a bank, financial institution
or other entities providing financing to the Purchasers or any of their
Affiliates, or a person acting as agent or trustee on behalf of such bank,
financial institution or other entity providing financing. The Purchasers
shall notify the Sellers of any such assignment and the assignee. Unless
provided for in this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any provision
contained in this Agreement is intended to confer any rights or remedies upon
any Person other than the Parties; provided, however, that the Financing
Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of and have the right to
enforce Sections 25.1, 25.2.1(b), this Section 26.2 and Section 26.1. In case
of any transfer or assignment, the limitations of liability of the applicable
Party shall also apply vis-a-vis the assignee or transferee.

interpreted in accordance with comparative Law ( _rechtsvergleichend_ ) to
come as close as possible to the legal meaning of the German term in such
other applicable jurisdiction.

Should any provision of this Agreement, or any provision incorporated into
this Agreement in the future, be or become, either in whole or in part, void (
_nichtig_ ), ineffective ( _unwirksam_ ) or unenforceable ( _undurchsetzbar_

other provisions of this Agreement. In such event the Parties shall recognize
and give effect to such valid, effective and enforceable provision or
provisions that come as close as legally possible to the commercial intention
of the Parties pursued with the void, invalid or unenforceable provision. The
same shall apply if this Agreement contains any gaps ( _Vertragsl ucken_).
