Company:

  

(a) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, par

(c) _Conversion of Common Stock_.

  

(i) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the

(ii) Subject to _Section 2.4(c)_ with respect to Restricted Shares, all shares
of Common Stock that have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)(i)_ shall

Section 2.2 _Redemption of Preferred Stock_. Unless the Company has redeemed
each share of Series A Preferred Stock as required by Section 6(a) of the COD,
the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to redeem, in whole and not
in part, each share of Series A Preferred Stock that is issued and outstanding
as of the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the COD. The Company
shall deliver a conditional notice of redemption (the " _Redemption Notice_ ")
in accordance with Section 6(c) of the COD not less than 15 days and not more
than 60 days before the Company's best estimation what is expected to be the
Closing Date to the holders of record (as of 5:00 pm New York City time on the
Business Day (as defined in the COD) preceding the day on which the notice is
given) of any Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed. The Redemption Notice
shall include: (a) the date of the redemption (the " _Redemption Date_ ") set
as the first Business Day after the anticipated Closing Date, (b) that all of
the Series A Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, (c) the redemption price,
calculated in accordance with Section 6(b) of the COD, (d) the place where the
Series A Preferred Stock are to be redeemed and shall be presented and
surrendered for payment therefor, and (e) that dividends on the shares to be
redeemed shall cease to accumulate from and after the date of such redemption.
If it is later determined that the Closing Date is not scheduled to occur on
the first Business Day immediately preceding the initial Redemption Date, then
the Company shall revoke such notice and promptly issue a new Redemption
Notice in accordance with the last sentence of Section 6(c) of the COD which
shall be consistent in all material respects with the original Redemption
Notice, except to state that the Redemption Date is set as the first Business
Day after the then-scheduled Closing Date. The Company will provide a copy of
the initial Redemption Notice to Parent at least three Business Days prior to
delivering such notice for Parent's review and comment, which comments will be
considered in good faith by the Company. At the Closing, the Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit with the Paying Agent (as defined
in the COD), funds sufficient to redeem the shares of Series A Preferred Stock
as to which the Redemption Notice shall have been given and shall give such
Paying Agent instructions and authority to pay the redemption price to the
holders of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed upon
surrender or deemed surrender in accordance with the COD. For the avoidance of
doubt, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, such
redemption of Series A Preferred Stock shall comply in all respects with the
COD.

  

Section 2.3 _Surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. Not less than ten Business Days before the Effective Time,
Parent shall (i) select a bank or trust company, satisfactory to the Company
in its reasonable discretion, to act as the paying agent in the Merger (the "

Agent in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company. Parent
shall be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.

  

(b) _Payment Fund_. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent

Stock, cash or immediately available funds in an amount equal to the aggregate

  

  

 

4  

  

Per Share Merger Consideration payable in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)(i)_.
Such funds provided to the Paying Agent are referred to as the " _Payment
Fund_."

  

(c) _Payment Procedures_.

  

(i) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as practicable but in no event later
than three Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a share of Common Stock
converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ , (A) a letter of transmittal in
customary form, specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to such holder's shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal and (B)
instructions for surrendering such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  

(ii) _Surrender of Shares_. Upon surrender of a Certificate or of a Book-Entry
Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent in accordance with the instructions

reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the holder of that Certificate or

Share. Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall be canceled
immediately. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Per Share Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

  

(iii) _Unregistered Transferees_. If any Merger Consideration is to be paid to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, then the Merger Consideration may be paid to such a transferee so
long as (A) the surrendered Certificate is accompanied by all documents
required by Parent to evidence and effect that transfer and (B) the Person
requesting such payment (1) pays any applicable transfer Taxes or (2)
establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that
any such transfer Taxes have already been paid or are not applicable.

  

(iv) _No Other Rights_. Subject to _Section 2.4(c)_ with respect to Restricted
Shares, until surrendered in accordance with this _Section 2.3(c)_ , each
Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the
Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, subject to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any
dividends or other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective
Time that may have been authorized by the Company and that remain unpaid at
the Effective Time. Subject to _Section 2.4(c)_ with respect to Restricted
Shares, any Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of any Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and the shares of
Common Stock formerly represented by it.

  

  

 

5  

  

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate is lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such affidavit
claiming such Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, the Merger
Consideration to such Person in respect of the shares of Common Stock
represented by such Certificate.

  

(e) _No Further Transfers_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the shares of Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock (to the
extent not earlier redeemed as required by Section 6(a) of the COD) that were
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time.

  

(f) _Required Withholding_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or foreign Law.
To the extent that any amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid to the
appropriate Governmental Authorities, those amounts shall be treated as having
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was
made for all purposes under this Agreement.

  

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent (or any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or
Affiliates) shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for any amount properly paid to a public official under any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

(h) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment
Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , that such investment shall be in (i)
obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, (ii) in
commercial paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of a state of
the United States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Ratings Service, respectively, or (iii) in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers' acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion, or in mutual funds
investing in such assets. Any such investment shall be for the benefit, and at
the risk, of Parent, and any interest or other income resulting from such
investment shall be for the benefit of Parent; _provided_ , that no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the Per Share Merger Consideration
payable to former stockholders of the Company, and Parent shall promptly
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly provide,
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the former
stockholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses to the extent
necessary to satisfy the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
under this _Article II_.

  

  

 

6  

  

(i) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent upon
demand. Thereafter, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has
not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall look only to Parent for,
and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration pursuant to the terms of this _Article II_ , subject to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 2.4(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, each option, including performance options, to acquire
shares of Common Stock (each, a " _Company Option_ ") that is outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or
vested, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holder of that Company Option, shall be cancelled and
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive from Parent or the
Surviving Corporation promptly following the Effective Time an amount in cash,
without interest, that is equal to the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger
Consideration over the per share exercise or purchase price of the applicable
Company Option (the " _Exercise Price_ "), _multiplied by_ the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock in respect of such Company Option immediately
before the Effective Time, which amount will vest and be payable, (i) with
respect to Company Options that are not vested in accordance with their terms
at the Effective Time, in each case, subject to the applicable holder's
continued employment through the applicable vesting date, on the earlier of
(A) the twelve-month anniversary of the date that the Effective Time occurs
(or the next payroll date following such anniversary) and (B) the next payroll
date following the date on which such Company Option would have otherwise
vested in accordance with its terms and (ii) with respect to Company Options
vested as of the Effective Time in accordance with their terms, at the
Effective Time, and in all cases, without any interest for the period from the
Effective Time until such date (with respect to each Company Option, such
applicable date, the " _Option Payment Date_ ") (for the sake of clarity, the
payment in respect of each Company Option that is already vested as of the
Effective Time shall be paid at the Effective Time); _provided_ , that if the
employment with Parent and its Affiliates of a holder of Company Options is,
prior to the applicable Option Payment Date, terminated (x) by Parent or any
of its Affiliates (including the Company) for any reason other than "Cause" or
(y) by such holder for "Good Reason," as such terms are defined on _Section
5.7(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, then the payment described in this
_Section 2.4(a)_ shall be accelerated to the next practicable payroll date
after the date of such termination. If the Exercise Price of a Company Option
is equal to or exceeds the Per Share Merger Consideration, such Company Option
shall be cancelled and terminated at the Effective Time without payment or
consideration therefor and the holder of such Company Option shall have no
rights whatsoever with respect thereto.

  

(b) Except as otherwise set forth in _Section 2.4(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, each share of restricted Common Stock, including

  

  

 

7  

  

performance shares (each, a " _Restricted Share_ "), that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration in cash, without interest, which amount will vest and be
payable, (i) with respect to Restricted Shares that are not vested in
accordance with their terms at the Effective Time, in each case, subject to
the applicable holder's continued employment through the applicable vesting
date, on the earlier of (A) the twelve-month anniversary of the date that the
Effective Time occurs (or the next payroll date following such anniversary)
and (B) the next payroll date following the date on which such Restricted
Share would have otherwise vested in accordance with its terms and (ii) with
respect to any Restricted Share vested as of the Effective Time in accordance
with its terms, at the Effective Time, and in all cases, without any interest
for the period from the Effective Time until such date (with respect to each
Restricted Share, such applicable date, the " _RS Payment Date_ ") (for the
sake of clarity, the payment in respect of each Restricted Share that is
already vested as of the Effective Time shall be paid at the Effective Time);
_provided_ , that if the employment with Parent and its Affiliates of a holder
of Restricted Shares is, prior to the applicable RS Payment Date, terminated
(x) by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Company) for any reason
other than "Cause" or (y) by such holder for "Good Reason," as such terms are
defined on _Section 5.7(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, then the payment
described in this _Section 2.4(b)_ shall be accelerated to the next
practicable payroll date after the date of such termination (the " _Converted
Restricted Share Award_ ").

  

(c) In addition to the payments made pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ , Parent
shall pay all accrued dividends and other distributions (including dividend
equivalents) as of the date of this Agreement without interest in respect of
each Restricted Share with a record date prior to the Effective Time that have
been authorized by the Company and that remain unpaid at the Effective Time as
set forth in, and not in excess of the amounts set forth in, _Section 2.4(c)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter. Such payments shall be made to the holders
thereof simultaneously with the payments made in respect of the Converted
Restricted Share Awards pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_.

  

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 2.3(d)_ , any payments made
pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation
and/or Parent by check or direct deposit. Such amounts shall be reduced by any
withholding required under (i) the Code, (ii) any applicable state, local or
foreign Tax Law, and (iii) any other applicable Law. To the extent that any
amounts are so withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental Authorities,
those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the holder of the
applicable award, as applicable, for all purposes under this Agreement.

  

(e) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
compensation committee of the Company Board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 2.4_.

  

  

 

8  

  

Section 2.5 _Dissenting Shares_.

  

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for
which the holder thereof (i) has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
to it in writing and (ii) is entitled to demand and has demanded the appraisal
of such shares in accordance with, and has complied in all respects with, the
DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
2.1_. At the Effective Time, (A) all Dissenting Shares shall be canceled and
cease to exist and (B) the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only
to such rights as may be granted to them under the DGCL.

  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.5(a)_ , if any holder of
Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal rights
(through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), then such
holder's shares (i) shall be deemed no longer to be Dissenting Shares and (ii)
shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically at the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly representing such shares in
accordance with _Section 2.3_.

  

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any shares of Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands
and any other related instrument or notice served on the Company under the
DGCL and (ii) the right to participate in and, at Parent's election and
expense, direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands
for appraisal. The Company shall not (or cause or permit any Person on its
behalf to) offer to make or make any payment or settle, compromise, or offer
to settle or compromise, or otherwise negotiate with respect to any such
demands for appraisal without the prior written consent of Parent.

entity and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification
is necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing

correct, the Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to enter
into this Agreement and, subject to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote,
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company
Board at a meeting duly called and held has unanimously (a) approved and
declared advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions

Section 3.9 _SEC Reports_. The Company has timely filed with the SEC
(including following any extensions of time for filing provided by Rule 12b-25
promulgated under the Exchange Act) all Company SEC Reports. The Company SEC
Reports (a) were prepared in all material respects in accordance with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the " _Securities Act_
"), the Exchange Act and other applicable Law and (b) did not, at the time
they were filed, or if amended or restated, at the time of such later
amendment or restatement, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which such statements were made, not misleading in any material respect. No
Subsidiary of the Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of
the Exchange Act or is otherwise required to file any periodic forms, reports,
schedules, statements or other documents with the SEC. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no material outstanding or unresolved comments from the

included in the Company SEC Reports:

  

(i) complied in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements
and the rules and regulations of the SEC;

accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis (except as
may be indicated in the notes to those financial statements); and

  

(iii) fairly presented in all material respects the consolidated financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates

(b) The Company maintains, and has maintained since January 1, 2014,
disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15

14  

  

designed and effective to ensure that all information relating to the Company
and its Subsidiaries required to be disclosed in the Company's periodic
reports under the Exchange Act is made known to the Company's principal
executive officer and its principal financial officers by others within the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably effective in timely alerting the Company's principal
executive officer and its principal financial officers to such information
required to be included in the Company's periodic reports required under the
Exchange Act. The Company maintains a system of "internal control over
financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) reasonably designed to provide reasonable assurance (i) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP consistently applied and (ii) that
transactions are executed only in accordance with management's general or
specific authorization. From January 1, 2014 until the date of this Agreement,
the Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its
principal executive officer and its principal financial officers prior to the
date of this Agreement, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of
the Company Board (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's or any of its
Subsidiaries' ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information in any material respect and (B) any fraud or bona fide allegation
of fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Company internal controls, in each case, if
any (any such disclosures, the " _Internal Controls Disclosures_ "). The
Company has made available to Parent copies of any Internal Controls
Disclosures. Since January 1, 2014, to the Knowledge of the Company, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any material written
complaint, allegation, assertion or claim regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, or their respective internal accounting controls.

  

(c) There are no off-balance sheet arrangements to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party of any type required to be disclosed in the
Company SEC Reports pursuant to Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated
under the Securities Act that have not been so described in the Company SEC
Reports.

  

Section 3.11 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.11_
of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no liabilities or obligations of
any kind, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, inchoate or otherwise

that are required to be recorded or reflected on a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with GAAP, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than:

sheet of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of September 30,

would constitute a breach of _clauses (b)_ , _(d)_ , _(e)_ , _(f)_ , _(h)_ ,
_(i)_ , _(j)_ or _(k)_ of _Section 5.1_.

  _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

  

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections of the disclosure letter
delivered by Parent to the Company before the execution of this Agreement (the
" _Parent Disclosure Letter_ "), it being agreed that disclosure of any item
in any section of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be
disclosure with respect to any other section to which the relevance of such
item is reasonably apparent on its face, Parent and Merger Sub represent and
warrant to the Company that:

  

Section 4.1 _Organization and Power_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Law of its
jurisdiction of organization. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and
properties and to carry on its business as now conducted.

  

Section 4.2 _Governmental Authorizations_. Assuming that the representations
and warranties of the Company contained in _Section 3.3_ are true and correct,
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger

contemplated by this Agreement do not and will not require any Governmental
Authorization, other than:

  

(a) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the

Parent Disclosure Letter; and

  

(h) such other Governmental Authorizations, where the failure to obtain such

Section 4.3 _Authorization_. Assuming that the representations and warranties
of the Company contained in _Section 3.4_ are true and correct, each of Parent
and Merger Sub has all necessary power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The board of directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub has (a) unanimously
approved and declared advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) declared that it is in the
best interests of the stockholders of Parent or Merger Sub that Parent or
Merger Sub, as applicable, enter into this Agreement and consummate the Merger
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
Parent, as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has approved and adopted this
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by each of Parent and
Merger Sub and the consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub. This
Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of Parent and
Merger Sub enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditor's rights, and to
general equitable principles). No vote or consent of the stockholders of
Parent is required by any applicable Law, or the certificate of incorporation
or bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents of Parent in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

provision of the organizational documents of Parent or Merger Sub;

  

  

 

33  

  

(b) contravene or conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, any
Law applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or by which any assets of

that all Governmental Authorizations described in _Section 3.3_ and _Section
4.2_ have been obtained or made;

  

(c) result in any violation, termination, acceleration of any material
obligation, cancellation or breach of, or constitute a default (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both) under, any Contracts to which Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any Parent Assets are bound
(collectively, " _Parent Contracts_ "), other than as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect; or

  

(d) require any consent, approval or other authorization of, or filing with or
notification to, any Person under any Parent Contracts, other than as, if not
obtained, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected

of common stock, par value $0.01 per share. All of the issued and outstanding

with any other Person, was at any time, or became, an "interested stockholder"
of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL, or has taken any action
that would cause the restrictions on business combinations with interested
stockholders set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL to be applicable to this
Agreement, the Merger or any transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

 

34  

  

(d) None of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates has any
agreement, arrangement or understanding concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with any director or officer of the Company.

Merger Sub will have as of the Effective Time and the Closing sufficient cash
available to pay all amounts to be paid by Parent and Merger Sub in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including Parent's and Merger Sub's costs and expenses and the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration on the terms and conditions contained in this
Agreement, and as of the Effective Time, there will not be any restriction on
the use of such cash for such purpose.

  

Section 4.7 _Litigation_. There is no Legal Action pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened, against Parent or any of its Affiliates
before any Governmental Authority (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Texas Department of Insurance and the New York Department of Financial
Services) that would be reasonably likely to or seeks to materially delay or
prevent the consummation of the Merger or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of
its Affiliates is subject to any Order of, or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
continuing investigation by, any Governmental Authority (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Texas Department of Insurance and the New York
Department of Financial Services), or any Order of any Governmental Authority
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Texas Department of Insurance and
the New York Department of Financial Services) that would be reasonably likely
or seeks to materially delay or prevent the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

Section 4.8 _Reserved_.

  

Section 4.9 _Absence of Arrangements with Management_. Except as set forth on
_Section 4.9_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter and this Agreement, there are no
agreements, arrangements or understandings between Parent or Merger Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the
Company's management or the Company Board, on the other hand, relating to the
transactions expressly contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the
Company after the Effective Time (including relating to the compensation
arrangements of any such member of the Company's management or the Company
Board).

  

Section 4.10 _Brokers_. The Company and its Subsidiaries will not be
responsible for any brokerage, finder's, success or other similar fee or
commission to any broker, finder, adviser or investment banker in connection
with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based on arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

  

  

 

35  

  

Section 4.11 _Independent Investigation_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge
and agree (a) that, except for the specific representations and warranties of
the Company contained in _Article III_ (which to the extent provided for in
this Agreement include and are subject to the Company Disclosure Letter and
the Company SEC Reports), none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
and their respective stockholders, controlling persons and Representatives
makes or has made (and Parent and Merger Sub have not relied on) any
representation or warranty, either express or implied, written or oral, with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates and their business,
operations, technology, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial
condition, prospects, projections, budgets, estimates or operational metrics,
or as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the information (including any
statement, document or agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement and any
financial statements and any projections, estimates or other forward-looking
information) provided (including in any management presentations, information
or descriptive memorandum, certain "data rooms" maintained by the Company,
supplemental information or other materials or information with respect to any
of the above) or otherwise made available to Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates, stockholders or Representatives, and (b) that, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the Company, its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries, stockholders or Representatives shall have any
liability or responsibility whatsoever to Parent or Merger Sub, their
Affiliates or their Subsidiaries, stockholders or Representatives on any basis
(including in contract or tort, under federal or state securities laws or
otherwise) based upon any information provided or made available, or
statements made (or any omissions therefrom), to Parent, Merger Sub, their
respective Affiliates or any of their respective Subsidiaries, stockholders or
Representatives, except (i) as and only to the extent expressly set forth in
this Agreement or (ii) in the case of Fraud. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has
relied on any fairness opinion issued by the Company Financial Advisor in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to

(B) constitute a violation of any applicable Law or (C) cause a material risk
of disclosure of any information that as determined by the Company in good
faith would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third-parties.
Nothing herein shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
disclose information to the extent such information would result in a waiver
of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or similar privilege or
violate any confidentiality obligation of such party existing as of the date
of this Agreement ( _provided_ , that such party shall use reasonable best
efforts to permit such disclosure to be made in a manner consistent with the
protection of such privilege or to obtain any consent required to permit such
disclosure to be made without violation of such confidentiality obligations,
as applicable).

  

(b) Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated November 16, 2015 (as amended, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Parent and the Company with respect to
the information disclosed under this _Section 5.3_.

  

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, rights to conduct or cause to be conducted any environmental
investigation of the current or former operations or facilities of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries without the written consent of the Company in its
reasonable discretion.

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, rights to control or direct the Company's or its Subsidiaries'
operations before the Effective Time. Before the Effective Time, the Company

over the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

Section 5.4 _Solicitation_.

  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, except as
expressly permitted by _Section 5.4(b)_ , the Company shall not, nor shall the
Company permit any of its Subsidiaries to, and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives not
to (i) solicit, initiate and knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by
way of furnishing non-public information or providing access to its
properties, books, records or personnel) any inquiries regarding, or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or
otherwise have any discussions (other than to state that the Company is not
permitted to have discussions under this Agreement, or to clarify the terms
thereof), or otherwise participate in any negotiations regarding a Takeover
Proposal, (iii) execute or enter into any Contract with

  

  

 

41  

  

respect to a Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement if permitted by _Section 5.4(b)_ ), (iv) take any action to make the
provisions of any anti-takeover Law or any restrictive provision of any
applicable anti-takeover provision in the Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws inapplicable to any transactions contemplated by any Takeover Proposal,
or (v) authorize any of or commit to agree to do any of the foregoing, other
than in connection with the actions permitted under _Sections 5.4(c)_ , _(d)_
and _(e)_. Immediately following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to (1) cease any
existing solicitations, discussions, communications or negotiations with any
Person (other than the parties and their respective Representatives) in
connection with an Takeover Proposal or any potential Takeover Proposal and
(2) terminate existing access to any physical or electronic data rooms
relating to any Takeover Proposal or potential Takeover Proposal (other than
for Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives).

  

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.4(a)_ , following the receipt by the Company of
a Takeover Proposal after entry into this Agreement that was not the result of
a breach of _Section 5.4(a)_ , if the Company Board determines, in
consultation with its legal and financial advisors, that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal and the failure to take any such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company may, in response to
such Takeover Proposal, subject to compliance with this _Section 5.4_ , (i)
furnish access and information with respect to the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries to the Person who has made such Takeover Proposal (including
through a physical or electronic data room) pursuant to (x) one or more
confidentiality agreements on terms that are not less favorable in the
aggregate to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall include customary standstill
provisions for an agreement of such type, except that such provisions may
include an exception to the extent necessary to allow such Person to make a
confidential proposal to the Company Board or (y) an existing confidentiality
agreement with such Person (each, an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_
") ( _provided_ , that all such written material non-public information has
previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person (and in any event
within 24 hours), and (ii) participate in discussions, communications and
negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal. From and after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall advise Parent in writing of the receipt of (x)
any Takeover Proposal, or (y) any inquiry, proposal, offer or request for

thereof) and disclose to Parent the material terms, conditions, and status of
any such Takeover Proposal and provide copies of any such written inquiry,
proposal, offer or request for information, including the identity of the
Person or group of Persons making such inquiry, proposal, offer or request for
information ( _provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to disclose
the identity of the Person making such Takeover Proposal if such disclosure is
prohibited by the terms of a confidentiality agreement with such Person that
is in effect as of the date of this Agreement). The Company shall notify
Parent within one Business Day orally and in

  

  

 

42  

  

writing of any material modifications to the financial or other material terms
of such Takeover Proposal or inquiry, proposal, offer or request for
information.

  

(c) Except as set forth in, or otherwise in connection with the actions
permitted under _Section 5.4(d)_ or (e), the Company Board shall not, directly
or indirectly, (i) withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board Recommendation
in any manner adverse to Parent (a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_
"), (ii) approve, endorse or recommend a Takeover Proposal, (iii) approve,
recommend or allow the Company to enter into a Contract relating to a Takeover
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement if permitted by
_Section 5.4(b)_ ), (iv) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Company Proxy Statement or (v) formally resolve to effect or publicly
announce a determination or resolution to effect any of the foregoing.

  

(d) Notwithstanding _Section 5.4(c)_ , the Company Board may, before obtaining
the Requisite Company Vote, in response to a Superior Proposal received by the
Company Board after entry into this Agreement, terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ to enter into a Contract with respect to such
Superior Proposal, but only if:

  

(i) such Superior Proposal did not result, directly or indirectly, from a
material breach by the Company of this _Section 5.4_ ;

  

(ii) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that
it is prepared to terminate this Agreement to enter into an agreement with
respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall include a summary of the
material terms and conditions of and copies of all material transaction
agreements and other material documents relating to such Superior Proposal and
the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal;

  

(iii) during the five Business Day period following Parent's receipt of such
notice, the Company shall have negotiated in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and any ancillary agreements intended to cause such Takeover
Proposal that constituted a Superior Proposal to cease to constitute a
Superior Proposal; and

  

(iv) Parent does not make, within five Business Days after the receipt of such
notice, a binding, written and complete (including any schedules or exhibits)
proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its legal and financial advisor, causes the Takeover Proposal that
constituted a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal
(it being understood that any amendment, revision, change or supplement to the
financial terms or other material terms or conditions of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notification pursuant to the foregoing
_clause (iii)_ and a new negotiation period under this _clause (iv)_, which
negotiation period shall be three Business Days instead of five Business
Days).

  

  

 

43  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
before obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, if, following the occurrence of
an Intervening Event, (i) the Company Board has concluded in good faith,
following consultation with its outside legal counsel that, in light of such
Intervening Event, its failure to withdraw, modify or amend the Company Board
Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (ii) the Company Board shall have
(x) first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, which notice shall include a
reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances relating to
such Intervening Event and (y) complied, as applicable, with the requirements
set forth in _Section 5.4(d)(iii)_ and _Section 5.4(d)(iv)_ as if such
provisions related to an Intervening Event instead of a Superior Proposal,
then the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit the Company from
complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a customary "stop, look
and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder, or making
any required disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law or such disclosure is otherwise required under applicable
Law; provided that nothing set forth in this _Section 5.4(f)_ shall be deemed
to modify or supplement the definition of "Company Adverse Recommendation
Change" or the obligations set forth in _Section 5.4(c)._

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this _Section 5.4_ ,
the Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) any violation of the restrictions
or obligations set forth in this _Section 5.4_ by any Subsidiary of the
Company or their or the Company's Representatives shall constitute a breach of
this _Section 5.4_ by the Company and (ii) the Company shall not nor shall it
permit any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any agreement that prohibits or
restricts the Company from either providing to Parent the information
contemplated by this _Section 5.4_ or otherwise complying with this _Section
5.4_.

is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting or at the time of any amendment or supplement

made by either Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein to the extent based on information supplied
by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company in connection with the
preparation of the Company Proxy Statement for inclusion or incorporation by
reference therein.

  

(c) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) respond to any
comments on the Company Proxy Statement or requests for additional information
from the SEC as soon as practicable after receipt of any such comments or
requests and (ii) cause the Company Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable after the Company is
informed that the SEC has no further comments on the Company Proxy Statement.
The Company shall promptly (A) notify Parent upon the receipt of any such
comments or requests and (B) provide Parent with copies of all correspondence
relating to the Company Proxy Statement between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other
hand. Before responding to any such comments or requests or the filing or

45

_however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, the Company may postpone or adjourn
the Company Stockholders Meeting: (a) with the consent of Parent; (b) for the
absence of a quorum; (c) to allow reasonable additional time (not to exceed 30
days) for the filing and distribution of any supplemental or amended
disclosure with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
which the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) is necessary under applicable Laws and for such

Company's stockholders prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting; (d) to
solicit additional proxies if the Company reasonably believes it may be
necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote; or (e) in connection with the

Section 5.7 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

  

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date (or, if earlier, until
the date of termination of the relevant employee) (the " _Continuation Period_
"), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to, provide to each individual who, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, is an employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
who continues in such capacity immediately following the Effective Time (each,
a " _Continuing Employee_ ") (i) salary, hourly wage rate, and short-term cash
bonus or commission opportunity that are no less favorable and (ii) other
material benefits (excluding equity based compensation (except as specifically
set forth herein or as required under any employment agreement) defined
benefit pension benefits, retiree medical benefits or long-term incentive plan
benefits) that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those provided to the
Continuing Employees, under the Company Benefit Plans as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall consider Continuing Employees for
grants, during the portion of the Continuation Period commencing in 2018, of
equity-based awards under Parent's equity compensation plans as part of its
ordinary course determinations with respect to grants of equity-based awards
to its employees generally.

  

  

 

46  

  

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, honor all Company Benefit Plans
(including all severance, paid time-off, change of control and similar plans
and agreements, including the Company's severance program in effect as of the
date of this Agreement and set forth on _Section 5.7(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter) to Continuing Employees in accordance with their terms as
in effect on the date hereof, subject to any amendment or termination thereof
that may be permitted by such Company Benefit Plans and except as provided
herein. Subject to the other obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation set forth in this Agreement (including the other provisions of
this _Section 5.7_ ), following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation are not required to maintain any benefit plan or agreement.

  

(c) _2016 Bonus Plan_. Notwithstanding any permitted amendment, termination or
discretion applicable to any Company Benefit Plan that provides for the
payment of annual cash bonuses, Parent agrees to, and agrees to cause the
Surviving Corporation and each of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates
to, to the extent not already paid prior to Closing, pay bonuses to Continuing
Employees in respect of calendar year 2016 (" _2016 Bonuses_ ") in an amount
determined by the compensation committee of the Company Board, but not to
exceed 100% of the target 2016 Bonus applicable to each Continuing Employee.
The 2016 Bonuses shall be paid by the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, at the time or times that the 2016 Bonuses would normally be paid
by the Company in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice but in no event later than February 2017.

  

(d) _2017 Bonus Plan_. Parent agrees to, and agrees to cause the Surviving
Corporation and each of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, pay
bonuses to Continuing Employees in respect of calendar year 2017 (" _2017
Annual Bonuses_ ") based on the achievement of performance targets determined
by the Company, in good faith, and in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, within 60 days of the date of this Agreement ("
_2017 Annual Bonus Targets_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) Parent shall
determine actual achievement of the 2017 Annual Bonus Targets with respect to
each Continuing Employee, both with respect to (x) the period between January
1, 2017 through the Closing (the " _Pre-Closing Period_ ") and (y) the period
following the Closing through the remainder of calendar year 2017 (the "
_Post-Closing Period_ "), it being understood that such determinations by
Parent shall be made reasonably and in good faith based on actual results,
after giving appropriate effect to the Merger and actions taken by Parent in
connection therewith that affect the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, (ii) each Continuing Employee who remains employed with Parent
and its Affiliates through December 31, 2017, shall be paid a 2017 Annual
Bonus of no less than half of such Continuing Employee's target 2017 Bonus
(the " _Minimum Guaranteed 2017 Annual Bonus_ ") at the same time or times
that the Parent pays annual bonuses in respect of calendar year 2017 to its
similarly situated employees, (iii) any Continuing Employee whose employment
is terminated without "Cause" or who voluntarily resigns with "Good Reason"
(each, as defined in _Section 5.7(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) ("
_Qualifying Termination_ ") during the 60-day period following the Closing
Date, will be entitled to receive a prorated portion of 100% of the target
2017 Annual Bonus applicable to such Continuing Employee based on the relative

  

  

 

47  

  

portion of the 2017 calendar year during which such Continuing Employee was
employed by the Company and the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Subsidiaries, ( _provided_ , that the provisions of this _clause (iii)_ shall
not result in the duplication of bonus payments to such Continuing Employee),
such prorated 2017 Annual Bonus to be payable promptly following the date of
such termination, but subject to such Continuing Employee's timely execution
and non-revocation of a release of claims, substantially in the form set forth
on _Section 5.7(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, and (iv) any Continuing
Employee who experiences a Qualifying Termination after the 60-day period
following the Closing Date, but prior to January 1, 2018, will be entitled to
receive a 2017 Annual Bonus equal to the greater of (x) such Continuing
Employee's Minimum Guaranteed 2017 Annual Bonus and (y) a prorated portion of
the actual 2017 Annual Bonus applicable to such Continuing Employee based on
the achievement of performance targets determined by the Company and based on
the relative portion of the 2017 calendar year during which such Continuing
Employee was employed by the Company and the Surviving Corporation and their
respective Subsidiaries, ( _provided_ , that the provisions of this _clause
(iv)_ shall not result in the duplication of bonus payments to such Continuing
Employee), such 2017 Annual Bonus to be payable promptly following the date of
such termination, but subject to such Continuing Employee's timely execution
and non-revocation of a release of claims, substantially in the form set forth
on _Section 5.7(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

(e) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor the
Company's retention program providing for the payment of retention bonuses to
certain Continuing Employees in connection with the Merger for the purpose of
retaining the services of such Continuing Employees, on the terms set forth on
_Section 5.7(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Retention Program_
"). Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and/or Parent
shall pay or cause to be paid the retention bonuses pursuant to the Retention
Program, to certain Continuing Employees in connection with the Merger for the
purpose of retaining the services of such Continuing Employees.

  

(f) For purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and, with respect to
vacation, paid time off or severance compensation only, determination of the
level of benefits, under each employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates providing
benefits to any Continuing Employee after the Effective Time other than any
equity based compensation plan or long-term incentive plan (collectively, the
" _New Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee shall receive full credit for such
Continuing Employee's years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries
before the Effective Time (including predecessor or acquired entities or any
other entities for which the Company and its Subsidiaries have given credit
for prior service), to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
entitled, prior to the Effective Time, to credit for such service under the
corresponding Company Benefit Plan (except to the extent such credit would
result in a duplication of accrual of benefits or with respect to any retiree
welfare plan or defined benefit pension plan). In addition, where applicable,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent agrees to use or
cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiaries or Affiliates to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to provide that: (i) at the Effective Time,
each

  

  

 

48  

  

Continuing Employee immediately shall be eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in each New Plan to the extent such waiting time was satisfied
under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "); (ii) Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions or limitations and actively-at-work requirements of each New Plan
that is a health plan to be waived or satisfied for such Continuing Employee
and his or her covered dependents to the extent waived or satisfied under the
analogous Old Plan as of the Effective Time; and (iii) for the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs Parent shall cause all eligible expenses
incurred by each Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
Continuing Employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

  

(g) With respect to any accrued but unused paid time off to which any
Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the Company Benefit Plan that is a
paid time off policy applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to allow such Continuing
Employee to use such accrued paid time off in accordance with the terms of
such Company Benefit Plan. If any Continuing Employee's employment is
terminated during the Continuation Period, Parent agrees to cause the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiaries or Affiliates to pay the Continuing
Employee any accrued but unused paid time off as of the Effective Time
(determined in accordance with this Section 5.7(g)) reduced by any paid time
off used between the Effective Time and the date of termination in accordance
with any Company Benefit Plan that is a paid time off policy applicable to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

(h) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable
best efforts to provide to Parent and its Representatives access at all
reasonable times to the Continuing Employees and the employment and personnel
records and data relating to the Continuing Employees to the maximum extent
permitted under applicable Law.

  

(i) Provided that Parent provides the Company written notice at least five
days prior to the Closing Date (but in no event later than the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date), the Company shall or shall cause any applicable
Subsidiary to take all actions necessary to terminate all Company Benefit
Plans intended to include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (each, a " _401(k)
Plan_ "), and the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k)
Plan(s) have been properly terminated (effective as of the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date), the form of such termination documents shall be
subject to review of Parent.

  

  

 

49  

  

(j) As soon as administratively practicable following the Closing Date, Parent
shall take all actions necessary to permit Continuing Employees who have an
account balance under a 401(k) Plan to rollover (whether by direct or indirect
rollover, as selected by such Continuing Employees) his or her "eligible
rollover distribution" (as defined under Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) in the
form of cash, a promissory note (in the case of loans) or any combination
thereof from the Seller 401(k) Plan to a tax-qualified defined contribution
retirement plan maintained by Parent or its Affiliate for the benefit of the
Continuing Employees.

  

(k) Nothing in this _Section 5.7_ or otherwise in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall: (i) confer upon any current or former employee of
the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including any Continuing Employee), any rights or
remedies including any right to employment or continued employment or any term
or condition of employment for any specified period, of any nature or kind
whatsoever, or restrict the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to terminate the employment
or service of any Person; (ii) be construed to establish, amend, fund or
modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, Contract, policy
or arrangement; (iii) limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan or other benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement, Contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by any of them; or (iv) create any third-
party beneficiary rights or obligations in any Person (including any employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) other than the parties to this
Agreement.

  

Section 5.8 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance_.

  

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation now
existing in favor of any present or former director, officer or employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the fiduciaries of any Company
Benefit Plans (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in the Company
Organizational Documents, in the comparable organizational document of any of
the Company's Subsidiaries, in any Contract between an Indemnified Party and
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries or otherwise in effect on the date of
this Agreement to survive the Merger and to continue in full force and effect
for a period of six years after the Effective Time or, if required, for such
longer period as is set forth in any applicable agreement with an Indemnified
Party in effect on the date of this Agreement as set forth on _Section 5.8_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify all
Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law with
respect to all acts and omissions arising out of or relating to their service
as directors or officers of the Company, its Subsidiaries or another Person,
if such Indemnified Party is or was serving as a director or officer of such
other Person at the request of the Company or Parent, or fiduciaries of the
Company Benefit Plans, whether asserted or claimed at or

  

  

 

50  

  

after or occurring before the Effective Time (including in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement). If any Indemnified Party is or
becomes involved in any Legal Action in connection with any matter subject to
indemnification hereunder, the Company shall or Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, advance as incurred any Damages out of or incurred
in connection with such Legal Action, subject to Parent's or the Surviving
Corporation's, as applicable, receipt of a customary undertaking by or on
behalf of such Indemnified Party, to repay such Damages if it is ultimately
determined under applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
be indemnified. In the event of any such Legal Action, (i) each of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the
defense of any such Legal Action and (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any Legal Action pending or threatened in writing to which an Indemnified
Party is a party (and in respect of which indemnification could be sought by
such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Legal Action or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents in writing.

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a "tail"
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy with coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous with respect to
claims arising out of or relating to events that occurred before or at the
Effective Time (including in connection with the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) than the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by the Company if the cost thereof does not exceed 300%
of the last annual premium paid by the Company for the current policies of
directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company before
the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company is
unable to so acquire such a "tail" policy then Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect for at least six years after the
Effective Time the current policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by the Company or policies with coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are no less advantageous with respect to
claims arising out of or relating to events that occurred before or at the
Effective Time (including in connection with the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) so long as Parent or the Surviving Corporation are not required to
pay an aggregate premium in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by
the Company for such insurance before the date of this Agreement (such 300%
amount being the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If the Company is unable to obtain
the "tail" policy and Parent or the Surviving Corporation are unable to obtain
the insurance described in the prior sentence for an amount less than or equal
to the Maximum Premium, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
instead obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium
equal to the Maximum Premium.

  

(d) Parent hereby acknowledges that the Indemnified Parties may have certain
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided
by other Persons. Parent hereby agrees (i) that Parent and the Surviving

  

  

 

51  

  

Corporation are the indemnitors of first resort (i.e., their obligations to
the Indemnified Parties are primary and any obligation of such other Persons
to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or
liabilities incurred by any such Indemnified Party are secondary) (and as
between Parent and the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Corporation is the
indemnitor of first resort), (ii) that Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be required to advance the full amount of expenses incurred by any such
Indemnified Party and shall be liable for the full indemnifiable amounts,
without regard to any rights any such Indemnified Party may have against any
such other Person and (iii) that Parent irrevocably waives, relinquishes and
releases (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to irrevocably waive,
relinquish and release) such other Persons from any and all claims against any
such other Persons for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any
kind in respect thereof. Each of Parent and Surviving Corporation further
agrees that no advancement or payment by any of such other Persons on behalf
of any such Indemnified Party with respect to any claim for which such
Indemnified Party has sought indemnification from the Surviving Corporation
shall affect the foregoing and such other Persons shall have a right of
contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such advancement or payment
to all of the rights of recovery of such Indemnified Party against the
Companies.

  

(e) The covenants contained in this _Section 5.8_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. For the avoidance of the
doubt, the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal
representatives shall be third-party beneficiaries with respect to the
covenants contained in this _Section 5.8_. The Surviving Corporation shall pay
all expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by
any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided in this _Section 5.8_ ; _provided_ , that, if requested by the
Surviving Corporation, the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such expenses, in the event that it is ultimately
determined in a final and non-appealable judgment by a Governmental Authority
with valid jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to this Agreement.

  

(f) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such

Section 5.9 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with applicable Law
(but subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to _Section 5.10_ ), each of the
parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or

  

  

 

52  

  

advisable to ensure that the conditions applicable to such party set forth in

Parent's obligations to pay (i) filing fees to Governmental Authorities or
(ii) other amounts to the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, in each
case, as required by _Section 5.10_ ), Parent shall not be obligated to pay
any amounts (other than de minimis amounts), or provide other consideration
(other than de minimis consideration), to any Third Party in connection with
obtaining or seeking to obtain any consents or approvals from such Third
Party. The terms of this _Section 5.9_ shall not limit the rights of the
Company set forth in _Section 5.4_.

  

Section 5.10 _Consents; Filings; Further Action_.

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with applicable Law, each of Parent and the Company shall, and
shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly (i) obtain any consents, approvals or other
authorizations, and make any filings and notifications required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) make any other
submissions either required or deemed appropriate by either Parent or the
Company, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the HSR Act, the DGCL, the NYSE

applicable, under such Laws, rules and regulations as soon as practicable and
(iv) defend any Legal Actions, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining Order
or any other Order entered by any court or other Governmental Authority
vacated or reversed. Parent and the Company shall cooperate and consult with
each other in connection with the making of all such filings and
notifications, including by providing copies of all submissions and written
communications with the government to the non-filing party's outside antitrust
or applicable regulatory counsel (and to the non-filing party upon consent of
the filing party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
before filing. Neither Parent nor the Company shall consent to any voluntary
extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary
delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
at the behest of any Governmental Authority without the consent of the other
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement and in any
event no later than (i) ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
each of Parent and the Company shall file (and not subsequently withdraw
without the prior written consent of the other party (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, or conditioned or delayed)) any Notification and Report
Forms and related material required to be filed by it with the Federal Trade
Commission and the United States Department of

  

  

 

53  

  

Justice, as applicable, to request early termination of the applicable waiting

Agreement, and shall promptly make any further filings pursuant thereto that
may be necessary, proper or advisable and (ii) 30 Business Days after the date
of this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company shall file (and not

with respect to all Required Company Consents.

  

(c) The Company shall cause its appropriate Subsidiary to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain receipt of a Certificate of Authority issued by
the New York State Department of Health authorizing such Subsidiary, in its
capacity as a Health Maintenance Organization, to write and administer

promptly as practicable.

  

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, promptly inform the other party upon receipt of
any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If Parent or the Company (or any
of their respective Subsidiaries) receives a request for additional
information from any Governmental Authority that is related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall endeavor in
good faith to make, or cause to be made, to the extent practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response to such request.
Prior to delivery of such response, to the extent practicable, such party
shall provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such response. No party shall participate in any substantive
meeting, or engage in any material substantive conversation, with any
Governmental Authority without giving the other party prior notice of the
meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Authority,
the opportunity to attend or participate. Parent shall advise the Company
promptly of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written)
that Parent proposes to make or enter into with any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
antitrust, competition or trade regulatory Law as promptly as practicable.

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall
promptly take (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to promptly take) any and all
action necessary to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or
vacate or lift, any Order that would have the effect of preventing or delaying
the Closing and to resolve the objections, if any, as any Governmental
Authority may assert under any applicable Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and, consistent with the foregoing, to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that would reasonably be
expected to be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible,
including (i) restructuring, selling, divesting or disposing of assets or
businesses of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries), or
committing to take such actions or (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take
actions that would limit Parent's or its

  

  

 

54  

  

Subsidiaries' (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation's and its Subsidiaries') freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, one or more of their respective assets or businesses;
_provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.10(e)_ shall require Parent to
take any action that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate have a material adverse effect on the business of Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent shall not require the Company to, and the Company shall not be
required to, take any action with respect to any Order or any applicable Law
that would bind the Company or its Subsidiaries irrespective of whether the
Merger occurs.

  

Section 5.11 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements about this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Neither Parent nor the Company shall issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to obtaining the other party's
written consent, except to the extent required by applicable Law, the NYSE
rules or this Agreement, in which case the party required to make the public
statement shall (a) give reasonable notice with the other party before issuing
any such release or making any such public statement, and (b) use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the other party with the opportunity to review
and comment thereon to the extent practicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent's consent shall not be required, and the Company shall not be required
to consult with Parent in connection with, or provide Parent an opportunity to
review or comment upon, any press release or other public statement or comment
to be issued or made with respect to any Takeover Proposal or with respect to
any actions contemplated by and taken in accordance with _Section 5.4(d)_ ,
_Section 5.4(e)_ , and _Section 5.4(f)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
without the prior consent of the other parties, Parent and the Company may (x)
communicate with its respective customers, vendors, suppliers, financial
analysts, investors and media representatives in a manner consistent with its
past practice in compliance with applicable Law to the extent such
communications consist of information included in a press release or other
document previously approved for external distribution by such other party,
(y) issue public statements or disseminate information to the extent solely
related to the operation of the business of Parent or its Subsidiaries and the
Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable and (z) make internal announcements
to their respective employees, contractors and services providers, in each
case that are not inconsistent in any material respect with the prior public
disclosure regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Parent's or the Company's consent, as
applicable, shall not be required, and Parent or the Company, as applicable,
shall not be required to consult with such other party in connection with, or
provide such other party an opportunity to review or comment upon, any press
release or other public statement or comment to be issued or made with respect
to any Takeover Proposal or with respect to any actions contemplated by and
actions taken in accordance with _Section 5.4(d)_ , _Section 5.4(e)_ or

Agreement or on its behalf in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Expenses_ ") shall be paid by
the party incurring those Expenses. Filing fees incurred in connection with
the HSR Act filings shall be borne by Parent.

  

Section 5.14 _Takeover Statutes_. Unless the Company Board has made a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with this Agreement, if any
takeover statute is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent, the Company
and their respective boards of directors shall use reasonable best efforts (a)
to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
(b) to otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such takeover
statute.

  

Section 5.15 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

  

Section 5.16 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may take
such further actions, if any, as may be necessary or appropriate to ensure
that the dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section
16 of the Exchange Act are exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence of any event known to it

the case of the Company, have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or, in the
case of Parent, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (B) cause any condition
set forth in _Article VI_ to be unsatisfied in any material respect at any
time prior to the Effective Time or (C) cause any authorization, consent,

Agreement to not be obtained by the Termination Date or (ii) any action, suit,

  

  

 

56  

  

proceeding, inquiry or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company or Parent, threatened that questions or challenges the validity of
this Agreement or the ability of any party to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.18_ shall not limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice nor shall
the party giving such notice be prejudiced with respect to any such matters
solely by virtue of having given such notice.

  

(b) Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall provide to Parent copies of
(i) all material written notices received from any Governmental Authority by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent such notice is primarily
related to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) all
material written notices received from CMS or the Department of Health and

Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company
regarding and the opportunity to participate in but not control the defense

expense).

  

(b) The Company shall obtain the prior written consent of Parent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before entering into any settlement,
understanding or other agreement relating to such Shareholder Litigation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company, with or without the consent of
Parent, shall be permitted to offer to make or make any payment with respect
to such Shareholder Litigation and to enter into any settlement, understanding
or other agreement relating to such Shareholder Litigation if the terms
thereof, in the aggregate, are no less favorable to the Company than those
described on _Section 5.19_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

the Company and U.S. Bank National Bank Association, as trustee (the "

in connection with the Merger), and (ii) cause to be executed and delivered to
the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as such terms

commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective representatives to,
cooperate with Parent in connection with the fulfillment of the Company's
obligations under the terms of the Convertible Notes and the Indenture at any
time after the date of this Agreement as reasonably requested by Parent.

case as of such date), except, in the case of _clause (ii)_ only, where the
failure of any such representations and warranties to be so true and correct

6.1_ , _Section 6.2_ or _Section 6.3_ , as the case may be, to be satisfied if
such failure was principally caused by such party's breach of any provision of
this Agreement or failure to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the

62  

  

would result in the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_ or

Section 7.4 \\\ _Termination by the Company_. This Agreement may be terminated
by the Company at any time before the Effective Time:

Section 8.8 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties to this
Agreement at any time before the Effective Time, whether before or after
obtaining the Requisite Company Vote, so long as (a) no amendment that
requires further stockholder approval under applicable Law after stockholder
approval hereof shall be made without such required further approval and (b)
such amendment has been duly approved by the board of directors of each of
Merger Sub, Parent and the Company. This Agreement may not be amended except
by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties to this Agreement.

  

Section 8.9 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time before the Effective Time, Parent
and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered under
this Agreement or

(c) subject to applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the covenants or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party
to any extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed by such party. The failure of any party to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

  

Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (and the exhibits hereto), the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter, and certificates
delivered hereunder, and the Confidentiality Agreement contain all of the
terms, conditions and representations and warranties agreed to by the parties
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior or
contemporaneous agreements, negotiations, correspondence, undertakings,
understandings, representations and warranties, both written and oral, among
the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of _Section 4.11_ , no
representation, warranty, inducement, promise, understanding or condition not
set forth in this Agreement has been made or relied upon by any of the parties
to this Agreement.

  

Section 8.11 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except (a) as provided in
_Section 5.8_ (Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance), (b)
for the provisions of _Section 2.1_ , _Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.4_ (which,
from and after the Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of holders of
Common Stock, Company Options and Restricted Shares as of the Effective Time),
(c) for the provisions of _Section 2.2_ (which shall be for the benefit of
holders of Series A Preferred Stock), (d) the rights of Covered Persons under
_Section 5.19_ _,_ (e) for the right of the Company on behalf of the holders
of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Company Options and Restricted
Shares to pursue and collect Damages (including claims for Damages based on
loss of the economic benefits of the transaction to the Company's
stockholders, including the loss of market value or stock price of the
Company) with respect to any breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub
(whether or not this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to _Article VII_
), which right is hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by Parent and
Merger Sub, Parent and the Company hereby agree that their respective
representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein are solely for the
benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and subject to the terms
of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer
upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties
set forth herein. The third-party beneficiary rights referenced in _clause
(e)_ of the preceding sentence may be exercised only by the Company (on behalf
of holders of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Company Options and
Restricted Shares) through actions expressly approved by the Company Board,
and no holder of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Company Options or
Restricted Shares whether purporting to act in its capacity as such or
purporting to assert any right (derivatively or otherwise) on behalf of the
Company, shall have any right or ability to exercise or cause the exercise of
any such right.

  

Section 8.12 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this
Agreement. If any provision

  

  

 

77  

  

of this Agreement, or the application of that provision to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted for that provision in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of the invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of that provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of that provision, or
the application of that provision, in any other jurisdiction. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a reasonably acceptable manner so that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as originally contemplated
to the fullest extent possible.

  

Section 8.13 _Rules of Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting this Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. Subject to and without limiting the introductory
language to _Article III_ and _IV_ , each party to this Agreement has or may
have set forth information in its respective disclosure letter in a section of
such disclosure letter that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to
which it relates. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a
disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not constitute an admission by such
party that such item is material, that such item has had or would have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case
may be, or that the disclosure of such be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

  

Section 8.14 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and
assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign or delegate, by operation of
law or otherwise, all or any portion of its rights or liabilities under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties to this
Agreement, which any such party may withhold in its absolute discretion. Any
purported assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be void.

  

Section 8.15 _Remedies_. Any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party
to this Agreement shall be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other
remedy contained in this Agreement, at law or in equity. The exercise by a
party to this Agreement of any one remedy shall not preclude the exercise by
it of any other remedy.

  

Section 8.16 _Specific Performance_. The parties to this Agreement agree that
irreparable injury would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement are
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise
breached, and further agree that, (a) damages to the Company caused by the
non-occurrence of the Closing, including damages related to reputational harm,
customer or employee losses, increased costs, harm to the Company's business,
and/or a reduction in the actual or perceived value of the Company or any of
its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, would be difficult or

  

  

 

78  

  

impossible to calculate, and (b) the right of specific performance is an
integral part of this Agreement and without that right neither the Company nor
Parent would have entered into this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or other court of the United States as specified in _Section
8.5_ , this being in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, and the
parties to this Agreement hereby waive any requirement for the posting of any
bond or similar collateral in connection therewith. Each party hereto agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that (x) the other party has an
adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

  

Section 8.17 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, as if the signatures to each counterpart were upon
a single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be deemed an
original of this Agreement. Facsimile signatures or signatures received as a
pdf attachment to electronic mail shall be treated as original signatures for
all purposes of this Agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when,
and only when, each party hereto shall have received a counterpart signed by
all of the other parties hereto.
