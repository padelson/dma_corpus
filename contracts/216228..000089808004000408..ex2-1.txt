AGREEMENT   This Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement ("Agreement") is dated
February 8, 2004, by and between Eastman Kodak Company, a New Jersey
corporation ("Seller") and ITT Industries, Inc., an Indiana corporation
("Buyer") (Seller and Buyer are referred to herein each individually as a
"Party" and collectively as the "Parties").    RECITALS   WHEREAS,
Seller is engaged in the Business (as defined below); and   WHEREAS, Seller
desires to sell and convey, and Buyer desires to purchase and acquire,
certain of the assets, properties and rights of Seller used in the Business,
and all of the stock of Research Systems, Inc., a Colorado corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller, for the consideration and on the terms set
forth in this Agreement, including the assumption by Buyer of certain of
the liabilities and obligations of Seller relating to the Business.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
herein, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:  
Article 1  Definitions and Usage   1.1 Definitions. For purposes of this
Agreement, the following terms and variations thereof have the meanings
specified or referred to in this Section 1.1:   (a) "2002 Balance Sheet"
shall have the meaning set forth in Section 3.4(a).   (b) "2003 Balance
Sheet" shall have the meaning set forth in Section 3.4(a).   (c) "Accounts

payment of Seller (but only to the extent arising in connection with the
operation of the Business) or RSI, and the full benefit of all security for
such accounts or rights to payment, including all trade accounts
receivable representing amounts receivable in respect of goods shipped or
products sold or services rendered to customers, including unbilled amounts
for contract work in progress, and (ii) any claim, remedy or other right
related to any of the foregoing.   (d) "Accrued Bonus Payments" shall mean
the aggregate amount of all annual bonus payments accrued as of the Closing
on the books and records of the Business, which amount represents a pro-rated
portion (as described in the following sentence) of the annual incentive

and restated effective January 1, 2002 and/or the Kodak United States
Employee Recognition Plan, as revised     on October 14, 2002, and Kodak
Wage Dividend Plan, as applicable, in respect of the year in which the
Closing Date occurs. Such accrued amount shall be determined based on
Seller\'s reasonable, good faith determination, consistent with past
practice, as to the relative achievement, as of the Closing Date, of the
performance goals to be achieved under such plans upon the completion of such
year, pro rated based on a fraction, the numerator of which will be equal to
the number of days between January 1, 2004 and the Closing Date, and

shall mean Business Employees who accept an offer of employment from Buyer as
provided in Section 10.1(a).   (f) "Active Welfare Benefits" shall mean any

definition, "control" (including "controlling," "controlled by," and "under
common control with") means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power
to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a Person,
whether through the ownership of voting securities or general partnership or
managing member interests, by contract or otherwise including, ownership,

the board of directors or similar body governing the affairs of such Person,
and shall be construed as such term is used in the rules promulgated under

Person shall be deemed to control any other Person in which it owns, directly
or indirectly, a majority of the voting interests.   (h) "Affiliate Plan"

(i) for the Building 101 Facility, and the Building 601 Facility, an
investigation by an independent environmental consultant
mutually satisfactory to Buyer and Seller, the scope of which shall be
proposed by Buyer in a written work plan developed in consultation with, and
subject to the approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of
Seller, and the purpose of which is to develop a reasonable understanding of
environmental conditions, including soil and groundwater, as they exist
approximately as of the Closing Date, by sampling and analysis. Seller shall
assist Buyer as necessary with information and access to properties and
personnel so that Buyer or Buyer\'s representative may develop work plans for
the baseline environmental assessments for the Building 101 Facility and the
Building 601 Facility, and Seller shall cooperate in reviewing and reasonably
approving such work plans, so that these Baseline Environmental Assessments
may be undertaken approximately as of the Closing, subject to reasonable
timing adjustments in light of climate conditions. Buyer will promptly
provide to Seller a copy of the final reports. Buyer is responsible for all
costs associated with the performance of these baseline environmental
assessments, and Buyer shall indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless the
Seller Indemnified Persons from any Damages arising from the conduct of
Buyer\'s contractor in performance of the work plans; and   (ii) for the
Hawkeye Plant, an investigation by an independent environmental consultant
mutually satisfactory to Buyer and Seller, the scope of which shall be
proposed by Seller in a written work plan developed in consultation with, and
subject to the approval (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the
Buyer, and the purpose of which is to develop a reasonable understanding of
environmental conditions, including soil and groundwater, as they exist
approximately as of the Closing Date, by sampling and analysis. Buyer shall
cooperate in reviewing and reasonably approving such work plans, so that the
Baseline Environmental Assessment for the Hawkeye Plant may be
undertaken approximately as of the Closing, subject to reasonable timing
adjustments in light of climate conditions. Seller will promptly provide to
Buyer a copy of the final report. Costs associated with the baseline   
3   environmental assessment of the Hawkeye Plant will be split 50/50
between the Seller and Buyer. Seller shall indemnify, defend, save, and hold
harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from any Damages arising from the
conduct of Seller\'s contractor in the performance of the work plan.  The
scope of work, including sampling, will be an effort to document
existing environmental conditions of site media including soil, surface
water, sediment, ground water, and soil vapor at or about the time of the
Closing. In selecting sample locations, the location of potential current and
historic sources of contamination identified in the course of developing a
sampling plan, and the locations of existing groundwater monitoring wells (if
any), will be considered, as well as mutually acceptable up-
gradient/background and down-gradient locations. Such sampling is intended to
reasonably document environmental conditions in site media (such as geologic
units, groundwater zones, and surface water bodies) that have been impacted
by historic or current operations on or off the site, although it is
recognized that sampling will not be comprehensive and cannot definitively
describe site conditions. All sampling will be completed promptly, weather
permitting, using methods that are acceptable to the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation. Should environmental impacts
be identified, Buyer and Seller will mutually agree on the need for further
site investigations, including additional sampling, to further document the
source, nature, and extent of contamination. The site investigations will
also attempt to document contaminant migration pathways and potential
receptors. Site investigations will be completed using methods that are
acceptable to the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation.   (r) "Bids" shall mean all proposals, offers, bids and
quotations made by Seller, primarily in connection with the Business, or by

Article 5  Covenants of Seller   5.1 Confidential Information.   (a)
Seller and its Affiliates will treat and hold any proprietary
and confidential information relating primarily to the operations or affairs
of the Business (the "Business Confidential Information") in the same manner
as Seller treats and holds its own confidential information of a similar
nature; provided, however, that to the extent any Business Confidential
Information is included in the Assigned Intellectual Property, Seller\'s
obligations with respect to the treatment of such information shall be
governed exclusively by the Intellectual Property Agreement and not by this
Section 5.1.   (b) The obligations of confidentiality contained in Section
5.1(a) will not apply to any information to the extent that (i) it becomes
generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public domain
after the Closing Date and other than through any act or omission of Seller
or any of its Affiliates in breach of this Agreement, (ii) it is disclosed to
Seller after the Closing Date, other than under an obligation of
confidentiality, by a Third Party who has no obligation to Buyer not to
disclose such information to others, or (iii) it is independently   
46   developed by Seller after the Closing Date without access to the
Business Confidential Information.   (c) Notwithstanding Section 5.1(a),
Seller may disclose Business Confidential Information to the extent required
by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Body or otherwise
as required by any Legal Requirement. Before disclosing Business Confidential
Information pursuant to this Section 5.1(c), Seller shall provide at least
five (5) Business Days\' notice to Buyer of the court order, subpoena,
interrogatories or government order that requires disclosure of the Business
Confidential Information so that Buyer may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy or waive compliance with this Agreement. Seller shall
consult with Buyer on the advisability of taking steps to resist or narrow
such request or requirement and shall otherwise cooperate with the efforts of
Buyer to protect the Business Confidential Information. Further, in the event
such disclosure is required under the laws, rules or regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission or any other applicable Governmental Body,
Seller shall (i) redact mutually agreed upon portions of the Business
Confidential Information to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
laws, rules and regulations and (ii) submit a request to the Securities and
Exchange Commission or such Governmental Body that such portions of the
Business Confidential Information receive confidential treatment under the
laws, rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or
otherwise be held in the strictest confidence to the fullest extent permitted
under the laws, rules or regulations of any other applicable Governmental
Body.   (d) At the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer copies of
all Confidentiality Letters.   5.2 Operation of the Business of Seller.

(including the actions described in Section 6.2(b)), from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing, Seller will conduct the Business solely in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in substantially
the same manner as presently conducted, will make all reasonable efforts,
consistent with past practice, to preserve relationships with employees,
customers and suppliers and will not take any action which would adversely
affect its ability to consummate the Contemplated Transactions. Without

this Agreement, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Buyer which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, neither Seller, in each case with respect to

Schedule 3.13(a) or with applicable Legal Requirements;   (f) hire or

(ii) the business of RSI as conducted as of the Closing (the "Competing

engage in any of the following activities, and the term "Competing Business"

Exchange Act; or   (ii) Acquiring assets or securities from, or effectuating
a merger, business combination, reorganization, exchange or recapitalization

this Agreement, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
Buyer with such title report or policy prior to or at the Closing or prior to
the transfer of title to the related Transferred Owned Real Property.   (b)
Building 601 Facility. The following conditions, contingencies
and limitations shall apply in connection with the transfer to Buyer of the
Building 601 Facility:   (i) Seller\'s obligation hereunder to transfer
title to the Building 601 Facility to Buyer shall be expressly contingent
upon Seller\'s obtaining all necessary governmental approvals, including
variances and subdivision approval, in final, non-appealable form and content
reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Buyer, for the subdivision of the land
included with the Building 601 Facility (the "Building 601 Land") from the
remaining lands of Seller adjacent to the Building 601 Land. The Building 601
Land is more particularly described in Schedule 3.6 and the map attached
thereto. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the exact
acreage, location and dimensions of the Building 601 Land are subject to the
mutual good faith agreement of the Parties, and will be in accordance with
the subdivision map to be prepared on behalf of Seller and approved as part
of the governmental approvals contemplated by this Section 5.5(b).   (ii)
After the Closing (or upon such time thereafter as title to the Building 601
Facility may be transferred to Buyer), Seller shall supply domestic hot
water, chilled water, domestic water, drinking water, compressed air,
electricity, natural gas, and low-pressure steam (collectively,
the "Utilities") to the Building 601 Facility from Seller\'s central utility
plant and related systems (the "Kodak Park Utility Facilities"). Prior to the
Closing, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree upon the terms
pursuant to which Seller shall provide the Utilities in accordance with the
foregoing (the "Utility Services Agreement"), the material terms of which are
set forth on Exhibit 5.5(b)(ii). Seller\'s obligation to transfer title to
the Building 601 Facility to Buyer hereunder shall be contingent upon
Seller\'s obtaining approval from the New York State Public Service
Commission (the "PSC") or appropriate Governmental Body, in final form and
content satisfactory to Seller in Seller\'s sole discretion, for Seller to
provide the Utilities in accordance with the foregoing.   (iii) After the
Closing (or upon such time thereafter as title to the Building 601 Facility
may be transferred to Buyer), the Building 601 Facility shall remain
connected to the sanitary sewer currently owned by Seller, running through
Kodak Park and ultimately connecting to a Rochester Pure Waters District
sanitary sewer under Ridgeway Avenue ("Kodak Sanitary Sewer"). Upon
the conveyance of title to the Building 601 Facility to Buyer, the Parties
shall enter into an agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit
5.5(b)(iii), pursuant to which Seller shall permit Buyer to use the Kodak
Sanitary Sewer via the existing    51   connections to the Building 601
Facility in accordance with the foregoing (the "Sanitary Sewer Agreement").
Seller\'s obligation to transfer title to the Building 601 Facility to Buyer
hereunder shall be contingent upon Seller\'s obtaining a variance from the
County of Monroe or other appropriate Governmental Body to allow the transfer
of the Building 601 Facility to Buyer and to allow the Building 601 Facility
to remain connected to the Kodak Sanitary Sewer.   (iv) Upon the transfer of
title to the Building 601 Facility to Buyer, or within a reasonable time
period thereafter, Seller shall effect the physical separation of the
Building 601 Facility from the Kodak Park fire main suppression system
without any further liability on the part of Seller to provide replacement
services or systems to the Building 601 Facility. From and after the date of
the Closing until the date of such separation, Seller shall continue to
provide Buyer with access to fire protection water from the Kodak Park fire
main suppression systems pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.
Seller shall reasonably coordinate the timing of the final separation of the
fire main suppression system with Buyer to enable Buyer to make any necessary
modifications to the Building 601 Facility to keep such facility in continued
compliance with applicable fire codes, but Seller makes no representations or
warranties of any kind regarding the compliance of the Building 601 Facility
with applicable fire codes subsequent to the separation of the Building from
the Kodak Park fire main suppression system. As of the Closing (or such time
thereafter as the Building 601 Facility may be transferred to Buyer), or
within a reasonable time thereafter, Seller shall disconnect the Building 601
Facility from the central Kodak Park monitoring system (the Simplex security
system currently serving the Building 601 Facility), but shall leave the
components of the system in place in such facility.   (v) Buyer shall grant
to Seller, and its successors and assigns, at the time of the Closing Date,
or at such time thereafter as the Building 601 Facility may be transferred to
Buyer, one or more permanent and exclusive easements or rights-of-way, in
recordable form mutually satisfactory to the Parties, over certain portions
of the Building 601 Land for ingress and egress by vehicles and pedestrians,
for stormwater drainage, fire water delivery systems, and other utilities,
for groundwater monitoring wells, for railway lines, and for such other
purposes as may be reasonably required by Seller, or as may reasonably be
required by Governmental Bodies in connection with obtaining the governmental
approvals (including subdivision approval) contemplated in this Section
5.5(b). Such easements granted to Seller as contemplated hereunder shall be
superior to the lien of any mortgage, security agreement or other financing
document granted or entered into by Buyer in connection with the purchase of
the Building 601 Facility. The exact location and dimensions of such
easements shall be as shown on the subdivision map referred to in paragraph
(i) above, or as otherwise determined by the good faith agreement of Seller
and Buyer, provided that Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate with the other
with respect to the location of such easements so as to minimize the impact
of such easements on Buyer\'s use and operation of the Building
601 Facility.   (vi) Prior to Closing, Seller shall, at Seller\'s sole cost
and expense, use reasonable efforts to pursue diligently the satisfaction of
each of the conditions set forth in this Section 5.5(b) and to complete the
other tasks contemplated in this Section 5.5(b) in connection with the
transfer of title to the Building 601 Facility to Buyer. If despite such
efforts, such conditions and tasks have not been satisfied or completed to
the reasonable satisfaction of Seller and Buyer prior to the Closing, the
Parties shall proceed with the Closing (but title to the   
52   Building 601 Facility shall not be transferred to Buyer upon Closing)
and (A) the provisions and obligations of this Section 5.5(b) shall survive
and continue in full force and effect and (B) Seller shall at Seller\'s sole
cost and expense, proceed with due diligence to satisfy the conditions and
complete the tasks set forth in this Section 5.5(b) in order to allow a
transfer to Buyer of title to the Building 601 Facility to occur as soon as
possible after the Closing.   (vii) In the event the term of the Building
601 Interim Lease Agreement expires prior to the transfer of title to the
Building 601 Facility to Buyer as contemplated herein, the Parties shall
agree to extend the term of the Building 601 Interim Lease Agreement for an
additional period not to exceed four (4) years (the "Renewal Term") during
which Renewal Term Seller shall either (A) satisfy the conditions set forth
in Section 5.5(b)(ii), or (B) at Seller\'s sole cost and expense, render the
Building 601 Facility as independently served by the Utilities necessary to
operate the Business through reasonably available alternative means. Seller
acknowledges and agrees that upon the expiration or earlier termination of
the Building 601 Interim Lease Agreement (including the Renewal Term), Seller
shall transfer title to the Building 601 Facility to Buyer.   5.6 Access.
During the period from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date,
Seller shall and shall cause RSI to give Buyer and its
authorized Representatives reasonable access during regular business hours
and upon reasonable notice to all plants, offices, warehouses and other
properties, facilities, employees, agents, books and records and other
information of the Business as they may reasonably request and, upon Buyer\'s
reasonable request, to furnish information to Buyer or its Representatives
regarding the Business, in each case for the purpose of planning for the
post-Closing integration of the Business and valuing the property for
purposes of the Allocation; provided, however, (a) that Buyer and its
Representatives shall take such action as is deemed necessary in the
reasonable judgment of Seller to schedule such access and visits through a
designated officer of Seller and in such a way as to avoid disrupting the
normal business of the Business, (b) Seller shall not be required to take any
action which would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other
privilege and (c) Seller need not supply Buyer with any information which, in
the reasonable judgment of Seller, Seller is under a contractual or
legal obligation not to supply, including as a result of any governmental or
defense industrial security clearance requirement or program requirements of
any Governmental Body prohibiting certain persons from sharing
information.   5.7 Tax Sharing Agreements Any agreement that provides for
the sharing or allocation of liability for Taxes or for the making of a
payment computed by reference to the Taxes, taxable income or taxable losses
of any other Person, to which RSI is party to, bound by or has any obligation
under (as may be included on Schedule 3.12 of this Agreement), shall be
terminated prior to Closing.   5.8 Intercompany Arrangements. Immediately
prior to Closing, (a) to the extent RSI has available cash, RSI will pay
Seller in cash the amount of any intercompany debt owed by RSI to Seller and
(b) Seller will capitalize any such debt that remains outstanding after such
payment has been made.    53    5.9 Assistance with Environmental
Permits. Seller shall assist Buyer as reasonably necessary to transfer, amend
or reissue existing Environmental Permits, and or obtain new Environmental
Permits, in order for Buyer to operate the Business.   5.10 Transition
Services. Between the date of this Agreement and Closing, Seller and Buyer
shall negotiate in good faith to enter into a transition services agreement,
the term of which shall be a reasonable transition period following the
Closing (not to exceed the one-year anniversary of the Closing) and pursuant
to which Seller shall provide Buyer with all services ("Services") provided
to the Business prior to the date of this Agreement that are necessary for
Buyer to continue to operate the Business (the "Transition
Services Agreement"). The Services shall be provided in substantially the
same manner, quality and scope (including in terms of volume and time) as
provided to the Business during the four (4) month period immediately prior
to the date hereof. The costs charged for such Services shall be the fully-
burdened costs. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Buyer may elect to not
receive certain services from Seller and Seller may be unable to provide
other services (such as routine access to Seller\'s on-site physician and
payroll (except for seconded employees)), even if such services are presently
provided to the Business, and Buyer shall not be obligated to receive, and
Seller shall not be obligated to provide, any such service. The Parties agree
that the Services will be otherwise provided on terms and conditions
customary for transition services of this nature.   Article 6  Covenants
of Buyer   6.1 Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges that any information
provided to or obtained by it pursuant to this Agreement shall be held by
Buyer and its Representatives in accordance with, and shall be subject to the
terms of, the Confidentiality Agreement between Buyer and Seller dated June
25, 2002, as extended pursuant to the letter between Buyer and Seller dated
November 10, 2003 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). Effective upon, and only
upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate, but only
with respect to information relating solely to the Business. Buyer
acknowledges that any and all other information provided to or obtained by it
pursuant to this Agreement shall remain subject to the terms and conditions
of the Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing provided that the term of
the agreement is extended to five (5) years after the date of the Closing. In
the event of any termination of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect, with respect to all information
obtained by or provided to Buyer hereunder, whether or not related to the
Business, notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement. Buyer shall
assist Seller as reasonably necessary to enable Seller to enforce any
Employee Confidentiality Agreement against a Business Employee who breaches
such agreement in connection with proprietary or confidential information
that is not included in the Assigned Intellectual Property.   6.2 Use of the
Seller Marks.   (a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that by this Agreement (or
by any Ancillary Agreement) it is obtaining no rights or licenses with
respect to any of the Seller Marks, including the name "Kodak" or any
derivative thereof, or to the Kodak logo. To that end, as soon as
practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after Closing, Buyer
(a) shall change and substitute: signage; promotional, marketing, and
advertising material in whatever    54   medium; stationery, business
cards, invoices and related materials and documentation; and packaging, in
each case that is used in the Business, in order to remove (or, where
feasible "sticker over") all references to Kodak and Kodak Marks and (b)
shall take all such other steps as may be required or appropriate to indicate
that there no longer exists any relation or affiliation between Buyer, on the
one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates (excluding Research Systems, Inc.),
on the other hand, other than as created by this Agreement; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall obligate Buyer to change or copy over any
engineering drawings or historical records in the form of copies of
correspondence, copies of existing invoices and other similar documents
prepared prior to the Closing Date. Nothing in any Transaction Agreement or
in the performance thereof, or that might otherwise be implied by law, shall
operate to grant Buyer any right, title or interest in and to the Seller
Marks. Buyer shall assign, and does hereby assign to Seller, without cost,
any rights it may acquire, if any, by the operation of law or otherwise, in
the Seller Marks pursuant to this Section 6.2. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer shall, for a period of six (6) months following the Closing,
be permitted to sell any RSI Inventory that exists as of the Closing Date and
that bears the Kodak name or other Kodak Marks.   (b) Between signing and
Closing, Seller and RSI shall be permitted, but not obligated, to remove or
sticker over references to Kodak and Kodak Marks in signage; promotional,
marketing, and advertising material in whatever medium; stationery, business
cards, invoices and related materials and documentation; and packaging, in
each case that is used in the Business.   Article 7  Conditions Precedent

and RSI Stock and to take the other actions required to be taken by Buyer at
the Closing is subject to the satisfaction, at or prior to the Closing, of
each of the following conditions (any of which may be waived by Buyer, in

4 of the Intellectual Property Agreement which are qualified as to
materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" shall be true and correct in all

except (a) to the extent such representations and warranties by their terms
speak as of an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and correct, or
true and correct in all material respects, as the case may be, only as of
such date; (b) to the extent that the failure of such representations and
warranties to be true and correct, or true and correct in all material
respects, as the case may be, is the result of changes occurring subsequent
to the date of this Agreement which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;
and (c) to the extent that a representation and warranty is not true as of
the date of this Agreement (or any earlier date) and, prior to the Closing
Date, Seller cures such breach.    55    7.2 Seller\'s Performance.
Each of the covenants and obligations that Seller is required to perform or
to comply with pursuant to this Agreement at or prior to the Closing shall

3.1;   (f) For each parcel of Transferred Owned Real Property, a
recordable bargain and sale deed containing a covenant against grantor\'s
acts subject to any easements required for Seller to provide utilities to

as requiring an assignment from Seller to Buyer, an Assignment and Assumption
of Lease in the form of Exhibit 7.3(g) executed by Seller;   (h) Each of
the Ancillary Agreements executed by Seller ; provided, however, that in the
event the Building 601 Facility is not transferred to Buyer at Closing

delivered by Seller at such later time as the Building 601 Facility may be

Contemplated Transactions and certifying to the incumbency and signatures of
the officers of Seller executing this Agreement and any other document
relating to the Contemplated Transactions; and   (l) A certificate of the
Secretary of Research Systems, Inc. certifying, as complete and accurate as
of the Closing, attached copies of the Governing Documents of Research
Systems, Inc.   7.4 No Proceedings. No Proceeding shall be pending that, in
the reasoned, written opinion of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, involves a
reasonable likelihood of an Order that could reasonably be expected to (a)
prevent consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, (b) cause the
Contemplated Transactions to be rescinded following consummation, or (c)
affect adversely the right of Buyer to own the Assets or RSI Stock, or to
operate the Business or RSI, immediately after the Closing, and no such Order
shall be in effect.   7.5 Authorizations and Consents.   (a) The waiting
period under the HSR Act, and any suspensory period associated with any
applicable equivalent foreign governmental reporting requirement, shall have
expired or been terminated.   (b) Each of the Consents identified in

simple title to the Transferred Owned Real Property, in each case free and
clear of any Encumbrances, other than the Permitted Real Estate Encumbrances,
and insurable at ordinary rates by a nationally recognized title company
selected by Buyer and reasonably acceptable to Seller ("Buyer\'s
Title Company") on a standard 1992 ALTA Form B owner\'s title insurance
policy (or equivalent policies reasonably acceptable to Buyer if the real
property is located in a state in which such ALTA policies of title insurance
are not available in such form and with such coverage as may be reasonably
acceptable to Buyer); provided, however, that in the event the Building 601
Facility is not transferred to Buyer at Closing pursuant to Section 5.5(b),
Buyer\'s ability to obtain title complying with the aforementioned conditions
with respect to the Building 601 Facility shall not be a condition precedent
to Buyer\'s obligations to close under this Article 7, but shall be a
condition precedent to the transfer of the Building 601 Facility to Buyer.
Seller agrees to execute such reasonable affidavits and other documents,
consistent with local practice, as are necessary to induce Buyer\'s Title
Company to issue policies free of any standard exceptions related to claims
of parties in possession and unfiled mechanics liens or liens of a similar
nature.    57    (b) FIRPTA. Seller shall have executed and delivered to
Buyer an affidavit of non-foreign status as described in Section 1445(b)(2)

Real Property is located; (ii) such documents, affidavits, certificates and
instruments as may be reasonably and customarily requested by Buyer or
Buyer\'s Title Company to facilitate the transfer of the Transferred Owned
Real Property and Buyer\'s obtaining title insurance with respect thereto
(including gap indemnities and lien and possession affidavits in such form
and containing such terms and conditions as may be reasonably and customarily
required by Buyer\'s title insurance company in order to insure title in
Buyer to the Transferred Owned Real Property subject to the Permitted Real
Estate Encumbrances and such matters as may be acceptable to Buyer in its
reasonable discretion); (iii) such easements in favor of Buyer benefiting the
Transferred Owned Real Property and burdening other real property owned by
Seller as may be necessary or desirable in order for Buyer to use and operate
the Business as presently conducted by Seller; and (iv) such other customary
instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance and assignment with respect to the
Transferred Owned Real Property as Buyer may reasonably request in writing;
provided, however, that in the event the Building 601 Facility is not
transferred to Buyer at Closing pursuant to Section 5.5(b), Buyer\'s
obtaining the foregoing documents with respect to the Building 601 Facility
shall not be a condition precedent to Buyer\'s obligations to close under
this Article 7, but shall be a condition precedent to the transfer of
the Building 601 Facility.   (d) Real Property Consents. Except as
otherwise required under this Agreement, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer at Closing each of the consents
identified on Schedule 3.7.   7.7 No Material Adverse Change. At any time on
or after the date of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred any
material adverse change in the business, properties, financial condition or
results of operations of the Business; provided, however, that in no event
shall any of the following constitute such a material adverse change: (i) any
change resulting from conditions in the industries and markets in which the
Business operates (including general reductions in United States military,
intelligence and homeland security planning and spending), (ii) any change
resulting from changes in general economic conditions, (iii) any change
resulting from the announcement or pendency of any of the Contemplated
Transactions, (iv) any change resulting from compliance by Seller with the
terms of, or the taking of any action as required by, this Agreement.

other actions required to be taken by Seller at the Closing is subject to
the satisfaction, at or prior to the Closing, of each of the following

materiality or material adverse effect shall be true and correct in all
respects and all other representations and warranties of Buyer in Article 4
of this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects , in
each case as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of the Closing Date

Closing Date, except (a) to the extent such representations and warranties by
their terms speak as of an earlier date, in which case they shall be true and
correct, or true and correct in all material respects, as the case may be,
only as of such date, (b) to the extent that the failure of such
representations and warranties to be true and correct, or true and correct in
all material respects, as the case may be, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
ability of Buyer to enter into and perform its obligations under the
Transaction Agreements or otherwise to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions; and (c) to the extent that a representation and warranty is not
true as of the date of this Agreement (or any earlier date) and, prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer cures such breach.   8.2 Buyer\'s Performance. Each of
the covenants and obligations that Buyer is required to perform or to comply
with pursuant to this Agreement at or prior to the Closing shall have been

wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by

certifying to the incumbency and signatures of the officers of Buyer
executing (or the officers giving power of attorney to others to execute)
this Agreement and any other document relating to the Contemplated
Transactions.   8.4 No Proceedings. No Proceeding shall be pending that, in
the reasoned, written opinion of Wilmer Cutler Pickering LLP, involves a
reasonable likelihood of an Order that could reasonably be expected to (a)
prevent consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, (b) cause the
Contemplated Transactions to be rescinded following consummation, or (c)
affect adversely the ability of Buyer to assume the Assumed Liabilities to
Buyer, and no such Order shall be in effect.   8.5 Authorizations and

Seller and which breach has not been waived by Buyer;   (b) by Seller if a
material breach or material violation of any provision of this Agreement has
been committed by Buyer, which breach cannot be or has not been cured within
thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach has been delivered to
Buyer and which breach has not been waived by Seller;   (c) by Buyer if any

than through the failure of Buyer to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement), and Buyer has not waived such condition on or before such
date;   (d) by Seller if any condition in Article 8 has not been satisfied
as of September 30, 2004 (other than through the failure of Seller to comply

to keep confidential certain information obtained by it hereunder, (ii)
Section 13.2 relating to public announcements, (iii) Section 13.1 relating to

or otherwise required to return to work or until the Inactive Employee is no
longer employed by Seller, whichever occurs first. Seller will continue to
employ any Inactive Employee until the earlier of: (i) 180 days after the
Closing Date (or such longer period as may be required under Legal

date such leave commenced), at salary or wage levels at least equal to those
provided by Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date. Each such offer of
employment shall be at the same geographic locale where the Business Employee
is working (or on leave from) immediately prior to the Closing Date.   (d)
Buyer shall perform, meet and discharge any obligations that may arise
following the Closing under the WARN Act or any similar state or local law or

arrangement or the compensation or working conditions of the Acquired
Employees and RSI Current Employees and (iii) amend, modify or terminate any
employee benefit or compensation plan, program or arrangement in which any

Requirements or otherwise provided herein, for the period from the Closing
Date until December 31, 2005 (such period, the "Continuation Period"), the
Acquired Employees and RSI Current Employees will receive employee benefits
that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those employee benefits
offered from time to time during the Continuation Period by Seller, including
the benefits provided under any of the Employee Benefit Plans and Affiliate
Plans (but excluding any Seller Stock Plans and Kodak Flexible Benefits
Plan); provided, however, that such benefits to be provided to such Employees
are in no event required to be, in the aggregate, more favorable than the
corresponding benefits provided to such Employees immediately prior to the
Closing. For the period from the Closing Date until December 31, 2005, the
Acquired Employees and RSI Current Employees will receive severance benefits
that are no less favorable than those severance benefits offered by Seller or
RSI, as applicable immediately prior to the Closing, provided however, in no
event shall Buyer be responsible for any Single Trigger Severance Liability.
Buyer will give each Acquired Employee, Former Business Employee, RSI Current
Employees and RSI Former Employees full credit for service with Seller for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and for purposes of welfare plans or
arrangements, benefit accrual under all plans or arrangements maintained by

under Seller\'s plans or under Affiliate Plans, as applicable.   (b) Buyer

rollover contributions (including any outstanding employee loans under the
Seller Savings Plan) from each Acquired Employee who (i) receives a
distribution from the Seller Savings Plan, (ii) elects such a rollover form
of distribution, and (iii) is employed by the Seller (or any of its
Affiliates) immediately prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall also pay to
each Employee the Seller Bonus Plans Payments at such time(s) as such amounts
would have been paid under the Seller Bonus Plans if no Closing had
occurred.   (c) Seller will provide to Buyer, not less than fifteen (15)
calendar days prior to the Closing Date, a list of all Acquired Employees who
are participating in or have participated in the Kodak Health Care
Reimbursement Account Plan (the "Seller FSA Plan"), together with the
elections made prior to the Closing Date with respect to such accounts
through the Closing Date.   (i) Buyer shall take all actions reasonably
necessary and legally permissible to provide that as of the Closing Date, the
Acquired Employees who are participating in the Seller FSA Plan as of the
Closing Date, will be allowed to participate in a plan of Buyer that
constitutes a "flexible spending" or "health reimbursement" account
arrangement that qualifies as a "cafeteria plan" under Section 125 of the
Code and any flexible spending arrangements thereunder (the "Buyer\'s FSA").
Buyer shall further take all actions reasonably necessary and legally
permissible to amend Buyer\'s FSA to provide that: (A) the Acquired Employees
who have elected to participate in the Seller FSA Plan shall
become participants in Buyer\'s FSA as of the beginning of the Seller FSA
Plan\'s plan year and at the level of coverage provided under the Seller FSA
Plan; (B) the Acquired Employees\' salary reduction elections shall be taken
into account for the remainder of Buyer\'s FSA plan year as if made under
Buyer\'s FSA; and (C) Buyer\'s FSA shall reimburse medical expenses incurred
by the participating Acquired Employees incurred by the Acquired Employees at
any time during the Seller FSA Plan\'s plan year (including Claims Incurred
prior to the Closing Date but unpaid prior to the Closing Date), up to the
amount of the Acquired Employee\'s election and reduced by amounts previously
reimbursed by the Seller FSA Plan.   (ii) Seller shall take all actions
necessary and legally permissible to amend the Seller FSA Plan to provide
that the Acquired Employees shall cease to be eligible for reimbursements
from the Seller FSA Plan as of the Closing Date.   (iii) As soon as
practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall transfer to Buyer, and
Buyer agrees to accept, those amounts which represent the debit and credit
balances under the Seller FSA Plan of the Acquired Employees who are to
become covered by Buyer\'s FSA and the transfer of such amounts shall take
into account on a net basis such employees\' payroll deductions and claims
paid through the Closing Date.    63    (d) Seller will provide to
Buyer, not less than five (5) calendar days prior to the Closing Date, a list
of all Acquired Employees who are participating in or have participated in
the Kodak Dependent Care Reimbursement Account Plan (the "Seller DCAP Plan"),
together with the elections made prior to the Closing with respect to such
accounts through the Closing Date.   (i) Buyer shall take all actions
reasonably necessary and legally permissible to provide that as of the
Closing Date, the Acquired Employees who are participating in the Seller DCAP
Plan as of the Closing Date, will be allowed to participate in the plan of
Buyer that constitutes a "dependent care assistance program" within the
meaning of Section 129 of the Code and any reimbursement arrangements
thereunder ("Buyer\'s DCAP"). Buyer shall further take all actions reasonably
necessary and legally permissible to amend Buyer\'s DCAP to provide that: (A)
the Acquired Employees who have elected to participate in the Seller DCAP
Plan shall become participants in Buyer\'s DCAP as of the beginning of the
Seller DCAP Plan\'s plan year and at the level of coverage provided under the
Seller DCAP Plan, (B) the Acquired Employees\' salary reduction elections
shall be taken into account for the remainder of Buyer\'s DCAP plan year as
if made under Buyer\'s DCAP; and (C) Buyer\'s DCAP shall reimburse dependent
care expenses incurred by the participating Acquired Employees at any time
during the Seller DCAP Plan\'s plan year (including Claims Incurred prior to
the Closing Date but unpaid prior to the Closing Date), up to the amount of
the Acquired Employee\'s balance under Seller\'s DCAP Plan and reduced by
amounts previously reimbursed by the Seller DCAP Plan.   (ii) Seller shall
take all actions necessary and legally permissible to amend the Seller DCAP
Plan to provide that the Acquired Employees shall cease to be eligible for
reimbursements from the Seller DCAP Plan as of the Closing Date.   (iii) As
soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall transfer to
Buyer, and Buyer agrees to accept, those amounts which represent the balances
under the Seller DCAP Plan of the Acquired Employees who are to become
covered by Buyer\'s DCAP and the transfer of such amounts shall take into
account on a net basis such employees\' payroll deductions and claims paid
through the Closing Date.   (e) With respect to any benefits to which any
Business Employee, Former Business or respective Dependent thereof, or other
qualifying beneficiaries thereof may be entitled under COBRA by reason of
qualifying events occurring before, on or after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
provide such benefits to any such Business Employees, Former Business
Employee and their respective Dependents and other qualifying beneficiaries
from and after the Closing Date through the period of required coverage under
COBRA.   (f) Buyer shall assume all the obligations of Seller or its
Affiliates for any Post-Employment Welfare Benefits in accordance with
Section 2.3(a) of this Agreement, and shall during the Continuation Period,
provide any individual identified on Schedule 3.19(b) with Post-Employment
Welfare Benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those
corresponding benefits offered from time to time during the Continuation
Period by Seller to its similarly situated former employees; provided,
however, that such benefits to be provided to such Employees are in no event
required to be, in the aggregate, more favorable than the benefits provided
to such Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date.    64     (g)
With respect to all welfare benefit plans maintained by Buyer on and after
the Closing Date in which the Acquired Employees are offered the opportunity
to participate: Buyer shall allow the Acquired Employees (and, as applicable,
their covered Dependents) to (i) participate in such plans without being
subject to any waiting periods or any restrictions or limitations for pre-
existing conditions, to the extent waiting periods have been met
and restrictions or limitations for pre-existing conditions were waived
under corresponding Employee Benefit Plans in which the Acquired
Employees participated prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) receive credit for
co-payments or deductibles paid during any calendar year in which the Closing
occurred under the Employee Benefit Plans in which they participated for
purposes of determining any deductibles and maximum out-of-pocket limitations
under any corresponding welfare benefit plans maintained by Buyer on and
after the Closing Date in which the Acquired Employees participate.   10.3
Defined Benefit Plans.   (a) Effective as of the Closing Date, Business
Employees shall cease to accrue benefits under the Seller Pension Plan, and,
thereafter, the Buyer shall enroll Acquired Employees in an existing or newly
created Buyer pension plan (the "Buyer Pension Plan"). Subject to the
consummation of the asset transfer described in Section 10.3 below: (i)
effective as of the Closing Date, with respect to Acquired Employees and
Former Business Employees, the Buyer Pension Plan shall waive any eligibility
requirements for participation that were previously satisfied under the
Seller Pension Plan, and, for Acquired Employees and Former Business
Employees, shall recognize service that is recognized under the Seller
Pension Plan for purposes of eligibility, vesting, service related level of
benefits, and eligibility for early retirement subsidies; (ii) Buyer agrees
to provide accrued benefits to Acquired Employees and Former Business
Employees under the Buyer Pension Plan that are no less than the accrued
benefits of the Acquired Employees and Former Business Employees under Seller
Pension Plan as of the Closing Date; (iii) accrued benefits of Acquired
Employees and Former Business Employees that are vested under Seller Pension
Plan as of the Closing Date shall be nonforfeitable under the Buyer Pension
Plan, (iv) Buyer shall, effective as of the Closing Date, assume all of the
Liabilities of Seller, its Affiliates and the Seller Pension Plan in
respect of benefits accrued by the Acquired Employees and the Former Business
Employees under the Seller Pension Plan on or prior to the Closing Date (the
"Pension Liability") (and, for the avoidance of doubt, cause the Buyer
Pension Plan to make payments to any Acquired Employee who becomes entitled
to receive payment of such accrued benefits on and after the Closing taking
into account the provisions of this Section 10.3 regardless of whether assets
have yet been transferred), subject to the transfer of assets from the Seller
Pension Plan to the Buyer Pension Plan in accordance with the provisions of
Section 10.3 below, and (v) with respect to benefits transferred from the
Seller Pension Plan, the Buyer Pension Plan shall recognize the service of
Acquired Employees with Buyer for the purpose of determining eligibility for
early retirement benefits and calculate benefits based upon the Final Average
Compensation of the Acquired Employees as defined in Buyer Pension Plan.
Also, for the avoidance of doubt, from the Closing Date through the True-Up
Transfer Date, in accordance with the provisions of Section 10.3 below,
Seller shall continue to cause the Seller Pension Plan to make benefit
payments to any Former Business Employees who is entitled to receive such
payments. Nothing in this Agreement shall require Buyer to provide coverage
to the Acquired Employees or the RSI Employees under any benefit formula for
Buyer\'s defined benefit pension plan for salaried    65    employees
in effect prior to the date that the Acquired Employees or the RSI Employees
first become eligible for Buyer\'s defined benefit pension plan for salaried
employees.   (b) To the extent not previously qualified under the
applicable provisions of the Code, Buyer shall take all action necessary to
qualify the Buyer Pension Plan under the applicable provisions of the Code
and shall make any filings and submissions to the appropriate Governmental
Bodies required to be made by Buyer. The Buyer Pension Plan and any successor
plans thereto shall contain appropriate provisions providing that (i) assets
transferred to the Buyer Pension Plan from the Seller Pension Plan may, upon
termination of the Buyer Pension Plan, revert to the employer or sponsor of
the Buyer Pension Plan to the extent permitted under the Seller Pension Plan
as in effect on the date hereof, applicable Government Contracts and Legal
Requirements; (ii) to the extent required by Legal Requirements, Buyer shall
preserve all optional forms under which each Acquired Employee or Former
Business Employee shall be entitled to receive his or her benefits accrued
through the Closing Date under the Seller Pension Plan (including any early
retirement subsidies); and (iii) the Buyer Pension Plan shall provide for
such benefit formulas as may be required in order for Buyer to satisfy its
obligations under Section 10.2(a) of this Agreement.   (c) As soon as
practicable, but in no event later than 90 days after the Closing Date (or,
if later, the date Seller has been provided evidence reasonably satisfactory
to it that the Buyer Pension Plan is qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code and the trust holding such assets is tax exempt under Section 501(a) of
the Code), Seller shall cause the Seller Pension Plan to transfer assets to
the Buyer Pension Plan equal to eighty percent (80%) of a reasonable estimate
of the Accrued Liability (such amount, the "Initial Transfer Amount"). The
term "Accrued Liability" shall mean the aggregate present value of the
accrued benefits (as defined in Treas. Reg. 1.414(l)-1(b)(9)) of
each Acquired Employee and Former Business Employee under the Seller Pension
Plan, determined as of the Closing Date on a plan termination basis using (i)
the interest factors specified by the PBGC and in effect as of the Closing
Date for an immediate or deferred annuity, as appropriate for that Acquired
Employee or Former Business Employee, and (ii) the other methods and factors
specified in the regulations underlying Section 4044 of ERISA for the
valuation of accrued benefits upon plan termination, including expected
retirement ages and expense load assumptions published by the PBGC, and the
1983 Group Annuity Mortality Table. The Initial Transfer Amount shall be
adjusted as follows: (x) it shall be decreased by any benefit payments made
by the Seller Pension Plan to any Acquired Employees or Former Business
Employees (or their beneficiaries) on or after the Closing Date and before
the date of transfer of the Initial Transfer Amount (such date, the "Initial
Transfer Date") and (y) increased by the amount of interest accrued on the
Initial Transfer Amount from the Closing Date through the Initial Transfer
Date, using an interest rate of five percent (5%) (the "Interest Rate"). For
purposes of this paragraph, "evidence reasonably satisfactory" of the Buyer
Pension Plan\'s qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code and the
corresponding trust\'s qualification under Section 501(a) of the Code shall
be deemed to be the delivery of either: (A) a favorable determination letter
from the IRS as to such status, as the plan and trust are currently in effect
(including any required changes thereto), or (B) (if no such letter has been
requested or received), an opinion of counsel, which states that such
plan and trust in form comply with the applicable requirements of the Code
and a commitment that Buyer will make any changes required by the IRS to
receive a favorable determination letter.    66    (d) As soon as
practicable following the transfer of the Initial Transfer Amount (but,
subject to the provisions of Section 10.3(f), in no event later than six
months after the Closing Date), Seller shall cause a second transfer of
assets from the Seller Pension Plan to the Buyer Pension Plan to be made of
the "True-up Amount." The True-up Amount shall equal the greater of (i) the
excess of the Accrued Liability Amount over the Initial Transfer Amount
and (ii) the excess of the CAS 413 Amount over the Initial Transfer Amount.
The "CAS 413 Amount" shall mean the maximum amount of assets required to be
transferred under 48 C.F.R. ss. 9904.413-50(c)(12) ("CAS 413"), calculated as
of the Closing Date using the assumptions and methods identified in such
section (as set forth in the CAS Actuarial Valuation Report of the Seller
Pension Plan prepared by Pine Cliff Consulting, dated January 6, 2004)
required in order to avoid any segment- closing adjustment being imposed
thereunder; provided, however, that prior to any such calculation, Seller
shall transfer to the CAS Sub-Account (as defined in Section 10.3(e) below),
in accordance with the methodology set forth in 48 C.F.R. ss.
9904.413-50(c)(8), assets equal to the present value of the accrued benefit
under the Seller Pension Plan of each Acquired Employee who, at any time
prior to working primarily for the Business, was employed by Seller (or any
Affiliate thereof) in another line of business but who participated in
the Seller Pension Plan during such other employment, to the extent not
previously transferred to the CAS Sub-Account prior to the Closing Date. The
True-up Amount shall be adjusted as follows: (x) it shall be decreased by any
benefit payments made by the Seller Pension Plan to the Acquired Employees or
Former Business Employees (or their beneficiaries) on or after the Initial
Transfer Date and before the date of transfer of the True-up Amount (the
"True-up Transfer Date") and (y) increased by the amount of interest accrued
on the True-up Amount from the Initial Transfer Date through the True-up
Transfer Date, using the Interest Rate. In the event that the total amount of
assets (which shall be equal the sum of the Initial Transfer Amount and the
True-up Amount (the "Total Transfer Amount")) are required to be reduced in
order to satisfy Section 414(l) of the Code and Section 4044 of ERISA (and
the regulations underlying either such section) (the "Pension Asset Transfer
Rules"), the total amount of the assets to be transferred from the Seller
Pension Plan to the Buyer Pension Plan will be equal to the maximum amount
permitted to be transferred under the Pension Asset Transfer Rules (such
reduced amount, the "414/4044 Amount") and Seller shall cause the Seller
Pension Plan to only transfer such amount of assets as necessary to equal the
414/4044 Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that, upon final
calculation by Seller Actuary of the True-up Amount, Seller Actuary
determines that the Initial Transfer Amount was in excess of the 414/4044
Amount (such excess amount, the "Overpayment"), Seller Actuary shall promptly
notify Buyer Actuary in writing of such determination, and Buyer Actuary
shall have thirty (30) Business Days to review Seller Actuary\'s calculations
thereof and respond to such determination. In the event that Buyer Actuary
concurs with Seller Actuary\'s determination, Buyer Actuary shall
notify Buyer in writing of such determination, and Buyer shall, within ten
(10) Business Days following receipt of such notice, cause the Buyer Pension
Plan to return to the Seller Pension Plan an amount of cash equal to the
Overpayment. The Overpayment shall be increased by the amount of interest
accrued from the Initial Transfer Date through the date of payment of the
Overpayment, using the Interest Rate.   (e) For purposes of this Section
10.3, any assets to be transferred from the Seller Pension Plan to the Buyer
Pension Plan as described in Sections 10.3(c) and (d) above shall: (i) based
on the fair market value of the assets as of the True-up Transfer Date, (x)
first be drawn from the sub-accounts of the trust of the Seller Pension Plan
that are subject to the    67   segment closing rules under CAS 413 (the
"CAS Sub-Account"), up to the minimum amount required to avoid a segment
closing adjustment thereunder, with (y) any remaining assets to be
transferred to be drawn from the sub-account that holds the assets that
correspond to the pre-payment credit account (as established by Seller
pursuant to the provisions of CAS 413 in respect of the Pension Liability)
and (ii) be in cash.   (f) All calculations to be made under this Section
10.3 shall be determined by an enrolled actuary designated by Seller (the
"Seller Actuary"). Seller shall provide any actuary designated by Buyer (the
"Buyer Actuary") with all information reasonably necessary to review all such
calculations in all material respects and to verify that such calculations
have been performed in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
If the Seller Actuary and Buyer Actuary disagree as to any of the Seller
Actuary\'s calculations, and such disagreement remains unresolved for a
period in excess of thirty (30) Business Days or such additional period as
Seller and Buyer may agree upon in writing (a "Disagreement"), the
Disagreement shall be submitted to the Chief Financial Officer of each of
Seller and Buyer for review and resolution in such manner as they deem
necessary or appropriate. If such Disagreement remains unresolved for an
additional sixty (60) Business Days, any remaining disputed matters will
be finally and conclusively determined by a qualified independent actuary
selected by Seller and Buyer, which actuary will not be any actuary who
performs services for either Buyer or Seller on an ongoing and continuous
basis. Promptly, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after its
acceptance of its appointment, the independent actuary will determine (based
solely on presentations by Seller and Buyer and not by independent review)
only those matters in dispute and will render a written report as to the
disputed matters and the resulting calculation of the amount of the pension
assets required to be transferred by Seller in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 10.3, which report will be conclusive and binding upon the
Parties. The fees and expenses of the independent actuary will be shared
equally by Buyer and Seller.   (g) The Initial Transfer Amount and the True-
Up Amount shall be calculated, if possible, such that no segment closing
adjustment is required under Cost Accounting Standards and no adjustment of
contract prices or cost allowance is required under any Government Contract.
If the 414/4044 Amount exceeds the CAS 413 Amount (such excess, the "Excess
Amount") and the amount of assets to be transferred from the CAS Sub-Account
is less than the 414/4044 Amount, in order to avoid any segment-closing
adjustment under CAS 413, then no later than the thirtieth (30th) day after
the True-up Date (subject to the provisions of Section 10.3(f)), Buyer shall
remit a cash payment to Seller in an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of
the Excess Amount, up to $35,000,000 (50% of the first $70,000,000 Excess
Amount). In the event that the Excess Amount is equal to or greater than
$70,000,000, Buyer shall not pay Seller any amounts in excess of the maximum
amounts calculated pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence. The Excess
Amount shall be increased by the amount of interest accrued on the Excess
Amount for the period beginning on the first calendar day after the third
Business Day following the True-Up Transfer Date through the date of payment
of the Excess Amount, using the Interest Rate. If the sum of the
Initial Transfer Amount and the True-Up Amount is less than the amount that
is required to be transferred to the Buyer as of the Closing Date under CAS
413, in order to avoid any segment-closing adjustment that would be imposed
under the Cost Accounting Standards, Seller shall, in its sole discretion, no
later than the thirtieth (30th) day after the True-up Date (subject to the
provisions of Section 10.3(f)), either (A) transfer such additional amount in
cash to Buyer as shall be necessary to avoid any such adjustment or (B)   
68   provide written notice to Buyer that Seller shall retain all
responsibility and liability for resolving any resulting issues with the
United States Government in connection with any such adjustment, except that
Buyer agrees that it will cooperate to the extent reasonably requested by
Seller and the United States Government in making any adjustment that may be
required in Government Contracts as a result of an agreement between Seller
and the United States Government, provided, however, that Seller shall hold
Buyer and its Affiliates harmless for any liability that Buyer or its
Affiliates may incur in connection with or as a result of any such
cooperation, adjustment or agreement.   (h) Notwithstanding anything set
forth in this Agreement to the contrary, if the PBGC requests or establishes
conditions of Buyer or Seller that are, in Buyer\'s and Seller\'s reasonable
good faith judgment, unacceptable to Buyer or Seller, the parties hereto
shall, in good faith, use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate to
respond to PBGC in a manner that is in the best interests of both Seller and
Buyer.   10.4 Forms W-2. As permitted by Internal Revenue Service Revenue
Procedure 96-60, Section 5, Seller and Buyer agree that Buyer, as the
"successor employer" described therein within the meaning of Section
3121(a)(1) of the Code, will furnish and file a single Form W-2 for wages
paid by both Seller and Buyer to each Acquired Employee during the calendar
year in which the Closing occurs, and Buyer assumes and shall perform
Seller\'s entire Form W-2 reporting obligations for the Acquired Employees,
provided that Seller furnishes Buyer with all information necessary to
fulfill such obligation on a timely basis. Seller shall remain responsible
for the Form W-2 reporting obligations for those employees of Seller who do
not become Acquired Employees. Accordingly, provided that Seller furnishes
Buyer with all information necessary to fulfill such obligation on a timely
basis, Buyer shall (a) furnish Forms W-2 to the Acquired Employees by January
31 following the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, and (b)
file Forms W-2 and W-3 as to the Acquired Employees with the Social
Security Administration by the last day of February of such calendar year.
With respect to Forms 941 for the quarter in which the Closing occurs, (x)
Seller will attach a statement to its Form 941 which (i) explains the
discrepancy that will exist between the amounts reported on its Form W-3 and
four quarterly Forms 941, (ii) includes the name, address, and identification
number of the Buyer, and (iii) includes a reference to Revenue Procedure
96-60, and (y) Buyer will attach a similar statement to its Form 941
referencing Seller. Finally, Seller will transfer to the successor all
current Forms W-4 and W-5 that were provided to Seller by the Acquired
Employees, and Buyer will keep the transferred Forms W-4 and W-5 on file and
deduct and withhold from the wages it pays to the Acquired Employees
according to the information supplied on those forms until an
Acquired Employee submits a revised form. Seller and Buyer shall follow
similar procedures with respect to state and local employment and withholding
tax administration where such procedures are available.   Article 11 
Indemnification; Remedies   11.1 Survival.   (a) All representations and
warranties in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall remain in
full force and effect for a period of eighteen (18) months after the   
69   Closing; provided, however, that (i) the representations and
warranties contained in Sections 3.1 and 4.1 (Organization and Good
Standing), 3.2(a) and 4.2(a) (Authority and Enforceability), 3.3
(Capitalization and Ownership of Research Systems, Inc. and its
Subsidiaries), and 3.21 and 4.4 (Brokers or Finders) shall survive the
Closing and shall remain in full force and effect until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement, (ii) the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.12 (Taxes) and 3.13
(Employee Benefits) shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force
and effect until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations with respect to the matter to which the claim relates,
as such limitation period may be tolled from time to time, (iii) the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.23
(Government Contracts) shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and
effect for a period of three (3) years after the Closing, and (iv) the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.18 (Environmental)
shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect for a period of
two (2) years after the Closing.   (b) Neither Seller nor Buyer shall be
entitled to make any claim for indemnification under this Article 11 with
respect to the breach of any particular representation and warranty contained
in Article 3 and Article 4 after the date on which such representation and
warranty ceases to survive pursuant to Section 11.1(a); provided, however,
that, if prior to the date on which such representation and warranty ceases
to survive, the Indemnifying Person shall have received written notification
of a claim for indemnity hereunder specifying in reasonable detail the basis
of any such claim, and such claim shall not have been finally resolved or
disposed of at such date, such claim shall continue as a basis for indemnity
until it is finally resolved or disposed of, subject to applicable statutes
of limitation which shall continue to run in all circumstances absent the
written consent of the Indemnifying Person to toll the applicable limitations
period.   11.2 Indemnification and Reimbursement by Seller. Seller will
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its successors and permitted assigns,
and its directors, officers, employees, agents and Affiliates (including RSI,
from and after the Closing) (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Persons"),
and will reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Persons for any loss, liability,
claim, actions or causes of action, assessments, damage, expense (including
costs of investigation and defense and reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses), whether or not involving a Third-Party Claim, (collectively,
"Damages"), arising from or in connection with:   (a) any breach by Seller
of any representation or warranty made by Seller in Article 3 of this
Agreement, in Section 4 of the Intellectual Property Agreement or in any
other Ancillary Agreement;   (b) any breach, failure or non-fulfillment by
Seller of any covenant or obligation of Seller in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement;   (c) any brokerage or finder\'s fees or commissions or
similar payments based upon any agreement or understanding made, or alleged
to have been made, by any Person with Seller (or any Person acting on their
behalf) in connection with any of the Contemplated Transactions;   
70    (d) (i) all Taxes that may be imposed upon or assessed against RSI
or its assets or properties with respect to any period (or portion thereof)
ending on or before the Closing Date, (ii) all Taxes of Seller with respect
to any operation of the Business and ownership of the Assets for any period
(or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date other than Assumed
Pre-Closing Taxes, and (iii) any Taxes that are the responsibility of Seller
pursuant to Section 2.7;   (d)-1 as further described in Section
1.1(q)-1(ii), any Damages arising from the conduct of Seller\'s contractor in
the performance of the work plans; or   (e) any failure by Seller to
perform or in due course pay and discharge any Retained Liabilities,
including the Retained Environmental Liabilities;  provided, however, that
any Damages shall be (i) reduced by the amount of any Tax refund, credit or
other reduction in Taxes actually realized by the Buyer Indemnified Person
and any reimbursement or other refund of any portion of such amounts actually
received (after deducting related costs and expenses) by the Buyer
Indemnified Person as a result of (A) Third Party indemnification pursuant to
any rights assigned to Buyer hereunder, or (B) the actual recovery of
such amounts (or portions thereof) as reimbursable costs under any cost-
type, flexibly-priced or fixed price contract for the provision of goods or
services to the United States Government under any Government Contract
assigned to Buyer hereunder and (ii) increased to take account of any net Tax
cost actually incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Person. Any indemnification
payment hereunder shall initially be made without regard to any Tax savings
or Tax cost and shall be increased or reduced to reflect any such Tax savings
or Tax cost only after the Indemnified Person has actually realized such
savings or cost. For purposes of this Agreement, the Indemnified Person shall
be deemed to have "actually realized" a Tax cost or a Tax benefit to the
extent that, and at such time as, the amount of Taxes payable by such
Indemnified Person is increased above or reduced below, as the case may be,
the amount of Taxes that such Indemnified Person would be required to pay but
for the incurrence or payment of such Loss or the receipt of the indemnity
payment, as the case may be. Upon written request of the Indemnifying Person,
the Indemnified Person shall provide appropriate support for its calculation
of its Tax savings or Tax cost.   11.3 Indemnification and Reimbursement by
Buyer. Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless Seller, and its successors and
permitted assigns, and its directors, officers, employees, agents and
Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Persons"), and will
reimburse the Seller Indemnified Persons for any Damages arising from or in
connection with:   (a) any breach by Buyer of any representation or warranty
made by Buyer in Article 4 of this Agreement;   (b) any breach, failure or
non-fulfillment by Buyer of any covenant or obligation of Buyer in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement;   (c) any Liability arising out of the
ownership or operation of the Assets, the Business and RSI after the
Effective Time (other than the Retained Liabilities);    71    (d) any
Liability arising from or in connection with any failure of Buyer\'s hiring
procedures with respect to the Business Employees to comply with Legal
Requirements;   (e) any claim by any Person for brokerage or finder\'s fees
or commissions or similar payments based upon any agreement or
understanding alleged to have been made by such Person with Buyer (or any
Person acting on Buyer\'s behalf) in connection with any of the Contemplated
Transactions;   (f) any failure by Buyer to perform or in due course pay and
discharge any Assumed Liabilities;   (g) as further described in Section
10.1(d), any Liability arising or resulting from any violations of Buyer\'s
post-Closing obligations under the WARN Act;   (h) as further described in
Sections 12.2(b) and 12.2(c), any Liability of Seller relating to Buyer\'s
performance or failure to perform under certain Business Contracts;   (h)-1
as further described in Section 1.1(q)-1(i), any Damages arising from the
conduct of Buyer\'s contractor in performance of the work plans; or   (i)
(A) all Taxes that may be imposed upon or assessed against RSI or its assets
or properties with respect to any period (or portion thereof) beginning after
the Closing Date, (B) all Assumed Pre-Closing Taxes, (C) all Taxes of Buyer
with respect to the operation of the Business or ownership of the Assets for
any period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date, and (C) any
Taxes that are the responsibility of Buyer pursuant to Section
2.7;  provided, however, that any Damages shall be (i) reduced by the amount
of any Tax refund, credit or other reduction in Taxes actually realized
(after deducting related costs and expenses) by the Seller Indemnified Person
and any reimbursement or other refund of any portion of such amounts actually
received by the Seller Indemnified Person, including reimbursement by way of
insurance, Third Party indemnification or the actual recovery of such amounts
(or portions thereof) as reimbursable costs under any cost-type, flexibly-
priced or fixed price contract for the provision of goods or services to the
United States Government and (ii) increased to take account of any net Tax
cost actually incurred by Seller. Any indemnification payment hereunder shall
initially be made without regard to any Tax savings or Tax cost and shall be
increased or reduced to reflect any such Tax savings or Tax cost only after
the Indemnified Person has actually realized such savings or cost. For
purposes of this Agreement, the Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have
"actually realized" a Tax cost or a Tax benefit to the extent that, and at
such time as, the amount of Taxes payable by such Indemnified Person is
increased above or reduced below, as the case may be, the amount of Taxes
that such Indemnified Person would be required to pay but for the incurrence
or payment of such Loss or the receipt of the indemnity payment, as the case
may be. Upon written request of the Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified
Person shall provide appropriate support for its calculation of its Tax
savings or Tax cost.   11.4 Consequential or Punitive Damages.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither Party shall,
in any event, be liable to the other Party for any consequential damages,
including loss of revenue or income or loss of business reputation or   
72   opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach of any
representation or warranty under Section 11.2(a) (other than loss of revenue
or income proximately caused by, and reasonably foreseeable in connection
with, the breach of any representation or warranty made in Section 3.4(a)
with respect to the unaudited historical statements of revenues, costs and
expenses of the Business for the calendar years ended December 31, 2002 and
December 31, 2003) or for any punitive or exemplary damages; provided,
however, that foregoing shall not be interpreted to limit indemnification for
any damages assessed in favor of a Third Party in connection with a Third-
Party Claim against an Indemnified Person, to the extent the Indemnified
Person is otherwise entitled to indemnification hereunder.   11.5
Limitations on Amount -- Seller. Seller shall have no liability
(for indemnification or otherwise) with respect to claims for breaches
of representations and warranties under Section 11.2(a) until the total of
all Damages with respect to such matters exceeds Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000) (the "First Deductible") and then only for the amount by which
such Damages exceed Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000); provided, however,
that any Damages which may be recovered from Seller arising out of or
resulting from a breach of Section 3.4(a) with respect to the unaudited
historical statements of revenues, costs and expenses of the Business for the
calendar years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003 shall be subject
to an additional deductible of Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000) (the
"Second Deductible"), and Seller shall have no liability (for indemnification
or otherwise) with respect to claims for breaches of the representations in
Section 3.4(a) with respect to the unaudited historical statements of
revenues, costs and expenses of the Business for the calendar years ended
December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003 until the total of all Damages with
respect to matters described in Section 11.2(a) exceed the sum of the First
Deductible plus the Second Deductible. In no event shall Buyer be able to
submit any claim to Seller for breaches of representations and warranties
under Section 11.2(a), whether incurred as a result of single incident or a
related series of incidents, unless the Damages under such claim are at least
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000). Seller\'s aggregate liability for
breaches of representations and warranties pursuant to Section 11.2(a) shall
in no event exceed One Hundred Eighty One Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand
($181,250,000). Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the limitations set
forth in this Section 11.5 will apply with respect to Damages arising out of
any breach of Seller\'s representations and warranties contained in Sections
3.1 (Organization and Good Standing), 3.2(a) (Authority and Enforceability),
3.3(b) (Ownership of Research Systems, Inc.) and 3.21 (Brokers or Finders)
and Seller will be liable for all Damages with respect to such breaches.
Seller shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification under Section
11.2(a) to the extent that the breach of the representation or warranty was
actually Known to Buyer as of the date of this Agreement.   11.6
Indemnification Procedures.   (a) Notice of Indemnity Claims. If any Buyer
Indemnified Person or Seller Indemnified Person entitled to or seeking
indemnification hereunder (an "Indemnified Person") (i) determines that any
event, occurrence, fact, condition or claim has given or could give rise to
Damages for which such Indemnified Person is or may be entitled to, or may
seek, indemnification under this Agreement, (ii) otherwise identifies an
event, occurrence, fact, condition or claim giving rise (or which may give
rise) to a right of indemnification hereunder in favor of such Indemnified
Person, or (iii) with respect to any Third Party Claim, becomes aware   
73   of the assertion of any claim or of the commencement of any Proceeding
(any of the foregoing (i), (ii) or (iii), an "Indemnity Claim"), such
Indemnified Person shall promptly notify (and, in the case of a Third Party
Claim, shall notify within thirty (30) days following assertion of such Third
Party Claim) the party obligated to provide indemnification or from whom
indemnification is being or will be sought (the "Indemnifying Person") in
writing of such Indemnity Claim (a "Claim Notice") describing in reasonable
detail the facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification hereunder and
shall include in such Claim Notice a reference to the provision(s) of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement upon which such Indemnity Claim is
based; provided, however, the failure of any Indemnified Person to give
timely notice thereof shall not affect any of its rights to indemnification
hereunder nor relieve the Indemnifying Person from any of its indemnification
obligations hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Person is
materially prejudiced by such failure. Any Claim Notice, other than one
relating to a Third Party Claim, shall specify the nature of the Damages and
(if known or reasonably capable of being estimated) the estimated amount
thereof.   (b) Third Party Claims. Any obligation to provide
indemnification hereunder with respect to any Third Party Claim shall be
subject to the following terms and conditions:   (i) If an Indemnified
Person gives notice to the Indemnifying Person pursuant to Section 11.6(a) of
the assertion of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall be
entitled (but not obligated, except with respect to Assumed Liabilities, as
to which Buyer shall be so obligated and the Retained Liabilities, as to
which Seller shall be so obligated) to assume the defense or settlement of
such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Person fails to elect in writing,
within ten (10) Business Days after receiving the above-described notice, to
assume the defense, the Indemnified Person may engage counsel to defend,
settle or otherwise dispose of such Third-Party Claim in its
reasonable discretion on behalf of and for the account and risk of the
Indemnifying Party.   (ii) In any case in which the Indemnifying Person has
assumed the defense or settlement with respect to a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to conduct the defense or settlement
thereof with counsel of its own choosing, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Person, provided that the Indemnifying Person
will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
unless settlement or release is solely for monetary damages and does not
involve any finding or admission by the Indemnified Party of a violation of
law or Order or other wrongdoing and contains an unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party.   (iii) In any case in which the Indemnifying Person has
assumed the defense or settlement with respect to a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to participate at its own cost in any
such action or proceeding to defend, or in any negotiations or proceedings to
settle, such Third-Party Claim, and shall have the right to employ its own
counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be
at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless the Indemnifying Person
shall not have employed counsel (reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Person) to take charge of the defense or settlement of such Third-Party
Claim, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of one   
74   counselor firm of counsel selected by the Indemnified Person shall be
borne by the Indemnifying Person. In no event shall an Indemnifying Person be
liable to any Indemnified Person for the cost of employing or using in-house
legal counsel regardless of whether the Indemnifying Person has, or has not,
assumed the defense or settlement of such Third-Party Claim.   (iv) If the
Indemnifying Person elects not to defend the Indemnified Person against any
Third Party Claim, whether through written notice to the Indemnified Person
or by failure of the Indemnifying Person to notify the Indemnified Person
that it elects to defend the Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Person
may defend, settle or otherwise dispose of such Third Party Claim, provided
that the Indemnified Person shall give written notice to the Indemnifying
Person of any proposed settlement of any Third Party Claim and
the Indemnified Person will not consent to the entry of any judgment, enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim or cease to defend
such claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Person
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).   (v) With respect to
any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under this Article 11: (i)
both the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person, as the case may be,
shall keep the other Person fully informed of the status of such Third-Party
Claim and any related Proceedings at all stages thereof where such Person is
not represented by its own counsel, and (ii) the Parties agree (each at its
own expense) to render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably
require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with each other in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any Third-Party Claim.   (vi)
With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under this
Article 11, the Parties agree to cooperate in such a manner as to preserve in
full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality of all confidential
information of the other Party and the attorney-client and work-product
privileges. In connection therewith, each Party agrees that: (i) it will use
its commercially reasonable efforts, in respect of any Third-Party Claim in
which it has assumed or participated in the defense, to avoid production of
the other Party\'s confidential information (consistent with applicable law
and rules of procedure), and (ii) all communications between any Party hereto
and counsel responsible for or participating in the defense of any Third-
Party Claim shall, to the extent possible, be made so as to preserve
any applicable attorney-client or work-product privilege.   11.7
Indemnification with Respect to Retained Environmental Liabilities.   (a)
Notwithstanding Section 11.2(e), in no event shall Seller have
any indemnification obligation to any Buyer Indemnified Persons to the extent
that the matter for which indemnification is sought results from: (i)
Prospecting Activities; or (ii) remediation or corrective action conducted by
or on behalf of Buyer which is not required by Environmental Laws, or
required by or at the direction of a Governmental Body.   (b) "Prospecting
Activities" shall mean deliberate drilling and/or testing of the soil and
groundwater on, at or about the Transferred Owned Real Property or the Leased
Real Property undertaken by or on behalf of Buyer or its Affiliates, to the
extent not required by any Environmental Law, for the primary purpose of
determining if environmental conditions exist    75   on, at or about
such properties. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on Seller\'s
indemnification obligations, Seller\'s indemnification obligations hereunder
shall apply with respect to, and the term "Prospecting Activities" shall not
include, (i) any investigations, undertakings, remediation,
corrective actions or reporting obligations of Buyer or its Affiliates in
connection with the construction or renovation of facilities on, at or about
the Transferred Owned Real Property, or (ii) Baseline Environmental
Assessments.   11.8 Indemnity Claims Requiring Environmental Remediation. To
the extent that a Claim Notice delivered by a Buyer Indemnified Person to
Seller (i) relates to (A) a breach of any representation set forth in Section
3.18 or (B) the Retained Environmental Liabilities, and (ii) requires, or
would reasonably be expected to require any investigation, remediation or
corrective action, the provisions of this Section 11.8 shall be
applicable.   (a) Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
control, manage and undertake all remedial action related to such Indemnity
Claim. If Seller desires to control, manage and undertake remedial action
relating to an Indemnity Claim, Seller shall so notify the Buyer Indemnified
Person in writing within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice,
except that such notice period shall be extended upon Seller\'s reasonable
request so that Seller may have sufficient time to assess its liability for
the Damages arising from such Indemnity Claim. During the notice period,
Seller shall have reasonable access to the Transferred Owned Real Property to
the extent necessary to determine Seller\'s liability for the Damages arising
from such Indemnity Claim and to non-privileged information in Buyer\'s or
its Affiliates\' possession at the time of the Claim Notice and to additional
non-privileged information (including, without limitation, sampling data,
consultants\' and other investigatory reports, correspondence with the
applicable Governmental Bodies, lab reports, cost documentation and access to
consultants) as such non-privileged information becomes available. During the
period prior to Seller\'s election to assume control of the remedial action,
the Buyer Indemnified Person may take any action which the Buyer Indemnified
Person would be authorized to take assuming that Seller had elected not to
assume such control in accordance with Section 11.8(f).   (b) If Seller
elects to undertake a remedial action pursuant to Section 11.8(a), Seller
shall consult in good faith with Buyer with respect to such remedial action.
Seller shall not be obligated to conduct any remedial action related to
Transferred Owned Real Property, nor to indemnify Buyer Indemnified Person
with respect to any remedial action related to Transferred Owned Real
Property, unless (i) the remedial action is required by Order or directive,
or is otherwise at the direction, of a Governmental Body or (ii) the remedial
action is required to comply with Environmental Law.   (c) If Seller or
Buyer obtains a letter from a Governmental Body stating that a remedial
action has been completed in compliance with applicable Environmental Law, or
that no action is required in addition to the remedial action that the
Governmental Body has approved, Seller shall not be required to take any
further remedial action related to the Transferred Owned Real Property (or
portion thereof) addressed by the remedial action, nor to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Person with respect to further remedial action undertaken by
a Buyer Indemnified Person, unless further action is required by such
Governmental Body or by another Governmental Body.    76    (d) Seller
agrees to conduct any remedial action in a manner that reasonably minimizes
interference with Buyer\'s operations. Buyer and its Affiliates shall provide
Seller with reasonable access to the Transferred Owned Real Property in order
to conduct any remedial action, and shall provide Seller with accurate
information in Buyer\'s possession concerning the location of underground
utilities installed after the Closing Date at the Transferred Owned Real
Property. Seller shall not be responsible for damage caused to
any underground utilities that have not been accurately identified to Seller
in accordance with the preceding sentence, but Seller shall be responsible
for, and shall indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless Buyer Indemnified
Persons from any other Damages arising from Seller\'s Remedial Action.  
(e) The Parties acknowledge that the completion of any remedial action may
involve the implementation of institutional controls (including, but
not limited to, restrictions on the use of the Transferred Owned Real
Property through deed restrictions or other similar instruments) approved by
the relevant Governmental Body. Buyer and Affiliates shall not object to the
imposition of any such institutional controls approved by the relevant
Governmental Body and shall provide any required consents or other
instruments or documents necessary for the implementation of such controls;
provided, however, that such controls are consistent with the use of the
Transferred Owned Real Property as of the Closing and do not interfere with
Buyer\'s operations at such Transferred Owned Real Property. If the Seller
implements a remedial action at a Transferred Owned Real Property that
requires long-term operation and maintenance, following a suitable period of
operation to reliably estimate the future, reasonably anticipated, out-of-
pocket costs associated with such operation and maintenance, Seller may upon
agreement of Buyer and Seller on the present value of such costs, pay to
Buyer such amount and be relieved of any further obligation to undertake such
long-term operation and maintenance.   (f) If Seller elects not to undertake
the remedial action pursuant to Section 11.8(b), whether by failure of Seller
to give the Buyer Indemnified Person timely notice as provided above or
otherwise, or if Seller elects to undertake remedial action but fails to do
so in accordance with the foregoing, then the Buyer Indemnified Person,
without waiving any rights against Seller, (i) may, in its reasonable
discretion, implement any remedial action described in clauses (i) and (ii)
of Section 11.8(b), and (ii) may settle or defend against the Indemnity Claim
in accordance with Section 11.6(b)(iv).   (g) Nothing in this Section 11.8
is intended to preclude or restrict Buyer\'s rights to conduct any different
or additional Remedial Action at its own expense on the Transferred Owned
Real Property.   11.9 Sole Remedy. From and after the Closing, the Parties
agree that the indemnification provisions of this Article 11 are intended to
provide the sole and exclusive remedy (absent fraud or other claims for
intentional torts) as to all Damages that either Party\'s Indemnified Persons
may incur arising from or relating to (a) this Agreement, (b) any breach by
Seller of any representation or warranty made by Seller under any Ancillary
Agreement or (c) the Contemplated Transactions, and each Party hereby waives,
to the extent it may do so, any other rights or remedies that would otherwise
have been available to it under common law, statute, or otherwise, including
any cause of action or claim based in contract or tort.    77   
Article 12  MUTUAL COVENANTS   Each of Seller and Buyer covenant and agree
as follows:   12.1 Antitrust and Competition Filings. Seller and Buyer will,
as promptly as 9practicable, file all notifications and information required
to be filed or supplied pursuant to the HSR Act in order to facilitate the
prompt consummation of the Contemplated Transactions (including any request
for additional information or production of personnel for administrative
interviews made pursuant to the HSR Act). Furthermore, Seller and Buyer will,
as promptly as practicable following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, file all notifications and information required to be filed or
supplied pursuant to any applicable equivalent foreign governmental reporting
requirement. Seller and Buyer shall furnish to the other such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection
with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the
HSR Act or any foreign governmental reporting requirement. Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest
and resist any Proceeding, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent), in each
case that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions. Buyer and Seller shall each use its best efforts
to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Order that would
restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, including defending through
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any party. Buyer
and Seller shall each take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition, or trade
regulation law that may be asserted by any Governmental Body with respect to
the Contemplated Transactions so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as
reasonably possible, including, proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Seller or Buyer as
may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any Order or Proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of
preventing or delaying the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall not be required to effect any sale,
divestiture or disposition of its assets or businesses or the Business to the
extent that doing so would have a material adverse effect on Buyer\'s
combined existing and acquired space businesses (including the Business).
Seller and Buyer shall keep each other apprised of the status of any
communications with, and inquiries or requests for additional information
from, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice or
any foreign merger authority with jurisdiction over the transaction and shall
comply promptly with any such inquiry or request.   12.2 Novations and
Consents.   (a) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Buyer and
Seller shall deliver all documents and instruments required to consummate
the Contemplated Transactions and make all other filings with Governmental
Bodies, and use all reasonable efforts to obtain all Consents and
Governmental Authorizations, required to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions and to allow Buyer to operate the Business and RSI after the
Closing substantially in the same manner as conducted in the ordinary course
immediately prior to the Closing. Buyer and Seller shall furnish promptly to
each other all information that is not otherwise available to   
78   the other Party and that such Party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing efforts. Buyer and Seller shall use all
reasonable efforts to obtain such consents to the assignment of the Business
Contracts as may be required.   (b) In the event that any and all
novations, transfer or other Consents necessary for the assignment, transfer
or novation of any Business Contract (including Government Contracts), or any
claim, right or benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, shall not
have been obtained prior to the Closing Date (except with respect to any
Consents identified in Schedule 7.5(b) that have not been obtained and have
not been waived as a condition to Closing by both Parties):   (i) the
Parties shall continue to use the efforts described in Section 12.2(a) to
obtain such novations, transfer or other Consents as promptly as practicable
after Closing until such time as it becomes reasonably apparent that such
efforts will not be successful, and   (ii) as of the Closing, this
Agreement, to the extent permitted by law, shall constitute full and
equitable assignment by Seller to Buyer of all of Seller\'s right, title and
interest in and to, and all of Seller\'s Liabilities under, such Business
Contracts, and Buyer shall be deemed Seller\'s agent for purpose of
completing, fulfilling and discharging all of Seller\'s Liabilities under any
such Business Contract to the same extent that Buyer would have
been obligated to complete, fulfill and discharge such Liabilities if such
Business Contract had been assigned to Buyer pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. The Parties shall take all necessary steps and actions to provide
Buyer with the benefits of such Business Contracts, and to relieve Seller of
the performance and other obligations thereunder, including entry into
subcontracts for the performance thereof. Buyer shall pay, perform and
discharge, and shall indemnify Seller in accordance with Article 11 with
respect to, all Liabilities of Seller relating to such performance or failure
by Buyer to perform under such Business Contracts.   (c) In the event
Seller shall be unable to make the equitable assignment described in Section
12.2(b)(ii), or if such attempted equitable assignment would give rise to any
right of termination, or would otherwise adversely affect the rights of
Seller or Buyer under such Business Contract, or would not assign all
Seller\'s rights thereunder at the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall continue
to cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide Buyer
with all such rights. Until the impediments to such an equitable assignment
are resolved, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) provide
to Buyer, at the request of Buyer, the benefits of any such Business Contract
to the extent related to the Business, (ii) cooperate in any
lawful arrangement designed to provide such benefits to Buyer and (iii)
enforce, at the request of and for the account of Buyer, any rights of Seller
arising from any such Business Contract against any third Person (including
any Governmental Body) including the right to elect to terminate in
accordance with the terms thereof upon the advice of Buyer. To the extent
that Buyer is provided the benefits of any Business Contract referred to
herein (whether from Seller or otherwise), Buyer shall perform the
obligations of Seller thereunder or in connection therewith, to the same
extent that Buyer would have been obligated to perform such obligations if
such Business Contract had been assigned to Buyer pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, and Buyer shall pay, perform and discharge, and indemnify
Seller in accordance with Article 11 with respect to, all Liabilities of
Seller relating to such performance or failure to perform by   
79   Buyer, and in the event of a failure of such indemnity, Seller shall
cease to be obligated under this Agreement in respect of the Business
Contract which is the subject of such failure.   (d) Any equitable
assignment described in Section 12.2(b)(ii), or any alternative arrangement
described in Section 12.2(c), will be superseded to the extent that the
novation, transfer or other Consents necessary for the actual assignment,
transfer or novation of the applicable Business Contract are obtained as a
result of the post-Closing efforts of the Parties described in Section
12.2(b).   (e) In the event that any Governmental Authorizations required
to consummate the Contemplated Transactions and to allow Buyer to operate
the Business and RSI after the Closing substantially in the same manner as
conducted in the ordinary course immediately prior to the Closing shall not
have been obtained prior to the Closing Date, the Parties shall continue to
use the efforts describe in Section 12.2(a) to obtain such Governmental
Authorizations as promptly as practicable after Closing until such time as it
becomes reasonably apparent that such efforts will not be successful.   (f)
If the appropriate contracting officer refuses to allow novation of a
Government Contract, then any payment made by the U.S. Government
after Closing with respect to such Government Contract will be for the
account of Buyer.   (g) In the event that the facility security clearances
described in Section 3.22(b) have not been obtained by Buyer prior to
Closing, after Closing, in addition to continuing its efforts to obtain such
clearances in accordance with Section 12.2(e), Buyer shall take all necessary
action to ensure that (i) all classified information pertaining to the
Business is adequately safeguarded; and (ii) any owners, officers, or
employees of Buyer without requisite personnel security clearances are
effectively denied access to classified information pertaining to the
Business.   12.3 Tax Matters.   (a) Cooperation. Buyer and Seller shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
Party, in connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return
(including any report required pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code and all
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder), any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other Party\'s request) the provision of Records that
are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
pursuant to the foregoing. Buyer and Seller agree (i) to retain all Records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Business or to RSI with respect
to any period (or portion thereof) ending prior to or on the Closing Date
until six (6) months after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations (giving effect to any and all extensions and waivers), and
to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Tax
authority, and (ii) to give the other Party reasonable written notice prior
to destroying or discarding any Records and, if the other Party so requests,
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party reasonable
access to such Records before they are destroyed.    80    (b) Tax
Refunds on Included Costs. If Seller receives any Tax refund relating to the
Business for periods prior to the Closing Date and the Tax liability to which
such refund relates was included as a cost in a cost-reimbursement or fixed-
price incentive (cost-redeterminable) Government Contract that is assumed by
Buyer hereunder, then Seller will cooperate with Buyer to determine the
appropriate portion of such Tax refund due to any Governmental Body as if
Buyer had pursued and obtained an identical Tax refund. Once the appropriate
portion due any Governmental Body is determined, Seller will promptly remit
to Buyer such amount to be paid to such Governmental Body in an appropriate
manner to be determined by Buyer.   (c) Apportionment. Except as provided in
Section 2.7, Taxes arising out of the operation of the Business or relating
to the Assets for any Tax period that includes but does not end on the
Closing Date, shall be apportioned between the portion of the period up to
and including the Closing Date and the portion of the period that begins
after the Closing Date as follows: (i) any real property, personal property
and other similar Taxes, or payments-in-lieu thereof, levied with respect to
the Assets or the Business shall be apportioned based on the number of days
of such Tax period up to and including the Closing Date and the number of
days of such Tax period after the Closing Date, and (ii) any other Taxes with
respect to the Assets or the Business shall be apportioned based on a closing
of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date. Seller shall be
responsible for the amount of any such Tax that is attributable to the
portion of the Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, and
Buyer shall be responsible for the amount of any such Tax that is
attributable to the portion of the Tax period beginning after the Closing
Date, regardless of when such Tax is levied or due. To the extent that the
post-closing portion of any such Tax is paid by Seller, either before or
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller after receipt
of an invoice therefor from Seller. To the extent that the pre-closing
portion of any such Tax is paid by Buyer, Seller shall promptly reimburse
Buyer after receipt of an invoice therefore from Buyer.   (d) Section
338(h)(10) Election. Buyer and Seller will join in making elections under
Sections 338(g) and 338(h)(10) of the Code and any corresponding elections
under state, local or foreign law (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10)
Election") with respect to the purchase of the shares of the capital stock of
Research Systems, Inc. by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. Seller shall
file, and shall cause its Affiliates to file, all Tax Returns and statements,
forms and schedules in connection therewith in a manner consistent with the
Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall take no position contrary
thereto unless required to do so by applicable tax laws. Seller will include
any income, gain, loss, deduction or other item resulting from the Section
338(h)(10) Election on the U.S. federal income Tax Return of its affiliated
group for the taxable year of the affiliated group that includes the Closing
Date to the extent required by applicable law. Seller shall pay any Tax
imposed on the affiliated group attributable to the making of the Section
338(h)(10) Election, including any state, local or foreign tax imposed on the
gain of the affiliated group. Seller and Buyer will cooperate in the
preparation and filing of IRS Forms 8023 and 8883 as provided for in Section
2.6.   (e) Stub Period For Research Systems, Inc. Seller will include
the taxable income or loss of Research Systems, Inc. (including any deferred
income triggered into income under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.1502-13 and
1.1502-14 and any excess loss accounts taken into income under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-9) on Seller\'s consolidated federal   
81   income Tax Returns for all periods through the Closing Date and pay
any federal income taxes attributable to such income. The income of Research
Systems, Inc. will be apportioned through the period up to and including the
Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date by closing the books of
Research Systems, Inc. as of the Closing.   (f) Straddle Period Tax
Returns. Buyer shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) all
Tax Returns of RSI with respect to any taxable period beginning before but
ending after the Closing Date (the "Straddle Period"), which returns shall be
prepared in a manner reasonably consistent with prior practice, and shall
timely pay or cause to be paid, all Taxes shown to be due on such Tax
Returns. Buyer shall, no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date
for the filing of such Straddle Period Tax Returns (including extensions for
filing), provide Seller with copies of such Tax Returns for Seller\'s review,
consent and approval. No later than ten (10) business days after the filing
of each such Straddle Period Tax Return, Seller shall pay to Buyer, in
accordance with Section 12.3(c), any amounts owed by Seller pursuant to
Section 12.3(c) with respect to Taxes covered by such Straddle Period
Tax Returns.   (g) Adjustment to Purchase Price. The Parties shall treat
any indemnity payment made under this Agreement as an adjustment to Purchase
Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by law.   12.4 Bulk
Sales. Buyer and Seller hereby waive compliance, in connection with the
Contemplated Transactions, with the bulk-transfer provisions as adopted in
any state where any of the Assets are located, and any other applicable
bulk sales laws with respect to or requiring notice to Seller\'s creditors,
in effect as of the Closing Date.   12.5 Update to Disclosure Schedules.
Each Party hereto will promptly disclose to the other in writing any
information with respect to (a) any matter that existed as of the date of
this Agreement and should have been set forth or described on such Party\'s
Disclosure Schedules or (b) any matter hereafter arising which, if existing
as of the date of this Agreement would have been required to have been
disclosed in such Party\'s Disclosure Schedules. No disclosure made pursuant
to this Section 12.5 or otherwise will be deemed to modify, amend or
supplement the representations and warranties of any Party hereto or to
prevent or cure or be deemed a waiver of any misrepresentation or breach of
representation or warranty or covenant or agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall be entitled amend the Disclosure Schedules
as expressly provided in Sections 3.6, 3.19(a) and 3.19(b), and such
amendments shall be deemed to amend the corresponding representations and
warranties of Seller.   12.6 Cooperation in Litigation and Audits.   (a)
In the event and for so long as either Party is actively contesting or
defending against any claim or Proceeding in connection with (i) any of the
Contemplated Transactions or (ii) any fact, circumstance, condition, event,
occurrence, act or failure to act on or prior to the Closing Date involving
the Business or RSI, the other Party will cooperate with the contesting or
defending Party and its counsel in the contest or defense and, to the extent
it is legally permitted to do so, make available its personnel and provide
such testimony and access to its Records as may be reasonably necessary in
connection with the contest or defense, at the sole cost and expense of
the contesting or defending Party (unless and to the extent that the
contesting    82   or defending Party is entitled to indemnification
therefor under Article 11). To the extent that this Section 12.6(a) requires
one Party to make available to the other Party Records or information that
are subject to a claim of attorney-client privilege or attorney work product,
the Parties shall enter into an appropriate and customary joint defense
agreement to protect the privileged nature and confidentiality of such
Records or information.   (b) In addition to providing reasonable access to
Records that relate to the Business or RSI in connection with litigation as
described in Section 12.6(a), Seller shall provide Buyer, subject to an
appropriate confidentiality agreement, with reasonable access to its Records
relating to indirect corporate general and administrative expenses invoiced
or allocated to the Business prior to the Closing Date, to the extent
reasonably necessary to permit Buyer to contest or defend governmental audits
or investigations, to complete required government reports or contract
closures relating to periods prior to the Closing Date or as required by any
Legal Requirement.   12.7 Retention of and Access to Records;
Cooperation.   (a) After the Closing Date, Buyer shall retain for a period
consistent with Buyer\'s record-retention policies and practices in place as
of the date hereof, those Records of Seller delivered to Buyer hereunder.
Buyer also shall provide Seller and its Representatives reasonable access to
such Records, during normal business hours and on at least three (3) Business
Days\' prior written notice, to the extent access to such records is required
or useful for financial reporting purposes or Tax purposes or to the extent
any such records relate to properties or activities of Seller other than the
Business or RSI or to the Excluded Assets or Retained Liabilities. As soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof, to the full extent Seller may
do so under applicable Legal Requirements, Seller shall provide Buyer and its
Representatives (i) reasonable access to any Records, to the extent that such
Records relate to the Business or Employee Benefit Plans, and (ii) reasonable
access to the Employees in order to make presentations to, and otherwise
communicate with the Employees regarding, the compensation and benefits to be
provided to such Employees on and after the Closing Date, in any such case
during normal business hours and on at least three (3) Business Days\' prior
written notice, for any reasonable business purpose specified by Buyer in
such notice. Seller shall retain all such Records for a period consistent
with the record-retention policies and practices in place as of the date
hereof. Commencing on and after the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall use
its commercially reasonable best efforts to establish all employee benefit
plans, programs and arrangements necessary to satisfy its obligations under
this Article 10 on the Closing Date, including contacting all third-party
benefit plan administrators, insurance companies and vendors as soon as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement and the public
announcement of the Contemplated Transactions. In addition, commencing on and
after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with
Buyer and its designated representatives to effectuate the foregoing,
including, without limitation, (i) allowing all access to applicable Seller
employees, on a timely basis, as reasonably requested by Buyer and its
designees, and (ii) providing, and directing its independent contractors
(including, without limitation, third-party benefit plan administrators,
insurance companies, vendors and actuaries, as applicable) to provide, Buyer
and its designated representatives, third-party benefit plan administrators,
insurance companies and actuaries, as applicable, with any information and
other assistance as may be reasonably requested by Buyer and its designees in
order to effectuate the foregoing.    83    (b) Notwithstanding anything
set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes of providing all or
a portion of the Employees with continuity of payroll and employee benefits
for a reasonable period of time after the Closing Date, in the event that the
Buyer delivers a request to the Seller, in a timely manner, to enter into an
employee services (secondment) agreement with the Seller, Seller hereby
agrees to enter into an agreement to provide such employee services to Buyer
at cost and upon such other terms reasonably satisfactory to each Party (the
"Employee Services Agreement").   12.8 FOS Agreement. One of the Seller\'s
Business Contracts is a classified contract with a United States Government
customer (the "Existing FOS Agreement"). The products and services provided
under the Existing FOS Agreement are provided by Seller both through the
Business and through Seller\'s other businesses. The Parties will use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the agreement of the customer to
divide the Existing FOS Agreements into two separate agreements (the "New FOS
Agreements") as of Closing, one to be retained by Seller (which shall cover
the products and services currently provided by Seller\'s other businesses)
and one to be assigned to Buyer hereunder as a Business Contract (which shall
cover the products and services currently provided by the Business). In the
event the customer does not agree to divide the Existing FOS Agreement into
two separate agreements as of Closing, the Existing FOS Agreement shall be
assigned to Buyer hereunder.   12.9 Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances.
From time to time, whether before, at or after the Closing, each of the
Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to take all action and to do
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective
the Contemplated Transactions (including satisfying the closing conditions
set forth in Article 7 and Article 8) The Parties shall cooperate reasonably
with each other in connection with any steps required to be taken as part of
their respective obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, and shall (a) furnish upon request to each other such further
information; (b) execute and deliver to each other such other documents; and
(c) do such other acts and things, all as the other Party may reasonably
request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions.   12.10 Ancillary Agreements. At the Closing,
Seller shall, or shall cause its applicable Affiliates, and Buyer shall, or
shall cause its applicable Affiliates, to enter into the Ancillary Agreements
to which each such party is or is intended to be a party and which have not
been executed and delivered prior to that time.   Article 13  General
Provisions   13.1 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement
or in the applicable Ancillary Agreement, each Party to this Agreement will
bear its respective fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements, and the Contemplated Transactions, including all fees
and expense of its Representatives. Buyer shall bear the cost of the HSR Act
filing fee as well as any costs associated with complying with any applicable
equivalent foreign governmental reporting requirements, including the fees of
any local competition counsel used by Buyer in connection with any foreign
filings. Buyer and Seller will share equally the cost of obtaining all
required    84   Consents as contemplated by Section 12.2; provided,
however, that, except as provided in Section 7.6, Seller shall bear all
brokerage commissions or any other compensation and fees, (other than Taxes,
which shall be governed by Section 2.7), payable by reason of the assignment
of the Real Property Leases or the transfer of the Transferred Owned Real
Property in connection with the consummation of the Contemplated
Transactions. If this Agreement is terminated, the obligation of each Party
to pay its own fees and expenses will be subject to any rights of such Party
arising from a breach of this Agreement by another Party.   13.2 Public
Announcements. From the date hereof through and including the Closing Date,
the Parties will consult with each other and will mutually agree upon any
press release or public announcement pertaining to this Agreement
or Contemplated Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public announcement unless the text and time of the release of
such statement has been approved by the other Party in writing, except to the
extent required by any Legal Requirement or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange or national automated
quotation system, in which case the Party proposing to issue such press
release or make such public announcement shall use its best efforts to
consult in good faith with the other Party and obtain the written consent of
the other Party, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, before
issuing any such press release or making any such public announcement.

attempt to resolve any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of, or in
connection with, this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (each, a
"Dispute") amicably and promptly by negotiations between executives from each
Party. Either Party may give the other Party written notice of any Dispute
not resolved in the normal course of business, in which case, the Parties\'
executives shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the Dispute within thirty
(30) days after such notice is provided. In the event, however, that (a) the
Dispute is not resolved within such thirty-day period (or any extension
thereto to which the Parties may mutually agree) or (b) that a meeting
between such executives has not occurred within such thirty-day period, then
regardless of whether any such good faith negotiations have actually
occurred, either Party may bring a claim against the other with respect to
the subject matter of such Dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
either Party may, at any time and without first engaging in any negotiations
with the other Party, seek provisional injunctive relief the may be required
to maintain the status quo.   13.5 Jurisdiction; Service of Process. Any

Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any Contemplated Transaction shall

has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the United States District Court for the
Western District of New York, and each of the Parties irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court in any such Proceeding, waives
any objection it may now or hereafter have to venue or to convenience of
forum, agrees that all claims in respect of the Proceeding shall be heard and
determined only in any such court and agrees not to bring any Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any
Contemplated Transaction in any other court.   13.6 Jury Trial Waiver. TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SELLER AND BUYER KNOWINGLY AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT    86   OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY
ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS.   13.7
Specific Performance. The Parties agree that in the event of either Party\'s
breach of its obligations to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions, damages may prove insufficient and the non-breaching Party
should be entitled to the remedy of specific performance.   13.8 Waiver.
Neither any failure nor any delay by any Party in exercising any right, power
or privilege under this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any of the
documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any
such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of
such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power
or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim
or right arising out of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any of
the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one Party,
in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless
in writing signed by the other Party and (b) no waiver that may be given by a
Party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is
given.   13.9 Entire Agreement and Modification. This Agreement, together
with the Confidentiality Agreement, supersedes all prior agreements, whether
written or oral, between the Parties with respect to its subject matter and
constitutes (along with the Disclosure Schedules, Exhibits, Ancillary
Agreements and other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement) a
complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between the
Parties with respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may not be
amended, supplemented, or otherwise modified except by a written agreement
executed by each Party.   13.10 Disclosure Schedules.   (a) Any disclosure
under one Schedule of the Disclosure Schedules which is disclosed in such a
way as to make its relevance or applicability to a representation or
representations made elsewhere in this Agreement or in an Ancillary Agreement
apparent on its face shall be deemed a disclosure with respect to such other
representation or representations. Disclosure of any matter in the Disclosure
Schedules shall not constitute an expression of a view that such matter is
material or is required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement.   (b) To the extent that any representation or warranty
set forth in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement is qualified by the
materiality of the matter(s) to which the representation or warranty relates,
the inclusion of any matter in the Disclosure Schedules does not constitute a
determination by Seller that any such matter is material. The disclosure of
any information concerning a matter in the Disclosure Schedules does not
imply that any other, undisclosed matter that has a greater significance or
value is material.   13.11 Assignments, Successors and No Third-Party
Rights. Neither Party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
other Party, except that Buyer may at any time assign any or all of its   
87   rights or obligations hereunder to one of its wholly owned
subsidiaries (but no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of any of its
obligations under this Agreement). Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects upon and inure to the
benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties. Nothing
expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any
Person other than the Parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of
this Agreement, except such rights as shall inure to a successor or permitted
assignee pursuant to this Section 13.11.   13.12 Severability. If any
provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by any court of
competent jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in
full force and effect. If any provision of this Agreement is held
unenforceable by reason of its extent, duration or scope, the Parties
contemplate that the court making such determination shall reduce
such extent, duration or scope and shall enforce it in its reduced form for
all purposes contemplated by this Agreement. If any provision of this
Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any other reason, the Parties
contemplate that the court making such determination shall adjust such
provision, rather than void it, if possible, in order to achieve the intent
of the Parties to the extent possible.   13.13 Construction. The headings
of Articles and Sections in this Agreement are provided for convenience only
and will not affect its construction or interpretation. All references to
"Articles," "Sections" and "Paragraphs" refer to the corresponding Articles,
