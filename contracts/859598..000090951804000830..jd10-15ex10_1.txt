Company is engaged in the business of (i) providing contract and charter
helicopter and fixed-wing aviation services and (ii) operating a scheduled

transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place
at the offices of Andrews Kurth LLP, 600 Travis, Suite 4200, Houston, Texas
77002, on the first Business Day immediately following the day on which the
last of the conditions to each party\'s obligations under this Agreement
(other than those that by their nature are intended to be satisfied at
Closing) set forth in ARTICLE V shall have been satisfied or waived, or at
such other time, date or place as the parties may agree. The date on which
the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date."   1

this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall deliver (or cause to be
delivered) the following to Purchaser:   (a) One or more certificates
representing the Shares, accompanied by  stock powers duly endorsed in blank
or accompanied by duly executed  instruments of transfer; and   (b) All

(or as reasonably requested by Purchaser in order to  facilitate the Stock
Purchase) at or (to the extent not previously  delivered) prior to the
Closing Date under this Agreement.   SECTION 1.05 Deliveries by Purchaser.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing,
Purchaser will deliver (or cause to be delivered) the following to
Seller:   (a) The Purchase Price as set forth in SECTION 1.02 of this
Agreement;  and   (b) All other documents, instruments and writings
required to be  delivered by Purchaser at or (to the extent not previously

Books and Records. Seller agrees to deliver to Purchaser at the Closing all
books and records of the Company (including correspondence, memoranda, books
of account, personnel and payroll records and the like).   SECTION 1.07
Transition Services. On the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser shall enter
into a transition services agreement (the "Transition Services Agreement,"
and, together with this Agreement, and each other agreement, document or
instrument or certificate to be executed in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the "Transaction
Documents"), in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 1.07.
Except as provided in the Transition Services Agreement, at the Closing, all
data processing, accounting, insurance, banking, personnel,
legal, communications and other products and services provided to the Company
by Seller or any of Seller\'s Affiliates, including any agreements or
understandings (written or oral) with respect thereto, will terminate.  
SECTION 1.08 Intercompany Accounts. SECTION 1.08 of the Disclosure Letter
sets forth all intercompany accounts (including cash) and all intercompany
leases and other agreements between the Company, on the one hand, and Seller
and or any of Seller\'s Affiliates (other than the Company), on the other
hand, and specifies whether they shall be paid or otherwise settled as of the
Closing.    2   SECTION 1.09 Working Capital Adjustment.   (a) SECTION
1.09 of the Disclosure Letter sets forth the components of  Working Capital
(as defined below) as of June 30, 2004, in the amount of  $12,700,000
("Target Working Capital").   (b) Within seventy-five (75) Business Days
following the Closing:   (i) Purchaser shall prepare and deliver, or cause
to be prepared  and delivered, to Seller a schedule of components of Working
Capital  as of the Closing Date prepared in a manner consistent with
SECTION  1.09 of the Disclosure Letter (the "Closing Date Working Capital 
Schedule") and a statement (the "Closing Statement") reflecting the 
calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase Price under this SECTION 
1.09(b), accompanied by a certificate of the chief financial officer  or
principal accounting officer of Purchaser, in such person\'s  capacity as an
officer of Purchaser and not in any personal capacity,  to the effect that
such Closing Statement has, to his or her  knowledge, been prepared in
accordance with the terms of this  Agreement.   (ii) The Closing Date
Working Capital Schedule shall reflect  Working Capital consistent with
financial reporting policies and  procedures used by the Business prior to
the Closing, which policies  and procedures are set forth in SECTION 1.09 of
the Disclosure Letter.  As used in this Agreement, "Working Capital" means
the amount of  current assets of the Business (excluding (A) Inventory, (B)
income  taxes, (C) intercompany accounts, (D) accounts receivable as of the 
Closing Date that are not collected on or prior to the date the  Closing
Statement is delivered to Seller ("Uncollected Accounts  Receivable") and (E)
proceeds from sales of non-current assets) minus  the amount of current
liabilities of the Business (excluding income  taxes and intercompany
accounts) and minus any new indebtedness  incurred prior to the Closing, each
as determined as of the relevant  date and recorded in accordance with
generally accepted accounting  principles in the United States ("GAAP") and
calculated in a manner  consistent with SECTION 1.09 of the Disclosure
Letter. From and after  the date the Closing Statement is delivered to
Seller, Purchaser shall  use commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with
the Company\'s  past practice, to collect any Uncollected Accounts Receivable
and  shall promptly remit to Seller any proceeds thereof.   (iii) Seller
shall have a period of twenty (20) Business Days  after delivery of the
Closing Date Working Capital Schedule and the  Closing Statement to review
(and cause Seller\'s auditors to review)  such documents and make any
objections it may have in writing to  Purchaser. Purchaser will make the work
papers and back-up materials  used in preparing the Closing Date Working
Capital Schedule and the  Closing Statement available to Seller and Seller\'s
auditors at  reasonable times and upon reasonable notice during such twenty
(20)  Business Day period in order to facilitate the resolution by the 
parties of any objections to the Closing Date Working Capital Schedule  and
the Closing Statement. If written objections are delivered to  Purchaser by
Seller within such twenty (20) Business Day period, then    3   Purchaser
and Seller shall attempt to resolve the matter or matters in  dispute. If no
written objections are made by Seller within such  twenty (20) Business Day
period, then the Closing Date Working Capital  Schedule and the Closing
Statement shall be final and binding on the  parties. If disputes with
respect to the Closing Date Working Capital  Schedule or the Closing
Statement cannot be resolved by Purchaser and  Seller within five (5)
Business Days after timely delivery of any  objections thereto, then, at the
request of Purchaser or Seller, the  specific matters in dispute shall be
submitted to KPMG International  or such other independent accounting firm as
may be approved by Seller  and Purchaser (KPMG International or such other
independent accounting  firm, as applicable, the "Auditors"), which firm
shall, not later than  twenty (20) Business Days after such submission,
render its opinion as  to such specific matters. If no such submission is
made within five  (5) Business Days after the delivery of the objections,
then any  unresolved objections shall be disregarded, and the Closing Date 
Working Capital Schedule and the Closing Statement shall be final and 
binding on the parties. Based on such opinion, the Auditors will then  send
to Seller and Purchaser their determination of the specified  matters in
dispute, which determination shall be final and binding on  the parties
hereto. Each of the parties shall bear all costs and  expenses incurred by it
in connection with such arbitration, and the  fees and expenses of the
Auditors shall be borne one-half by Seller  and one-half by Purchaser.  
(iv) If the Working Capital reflected on the Closing Date Working  Capital
Schedule as finally determined under SECTION 1.09(b)(iii) of  this Agreement
is less than the Target Working Capital, then within  five (5) Business Days
following the final determination thereof,  Seller shall pay to Purchaser, by
wire transfer of immediately  available funds to the account or accounts
designated by Purchaser,  the amount of such deficiency with interest thereon
at a rate per  annum equal to the rate of interest published by the Wall
Street  Journal from time to time as the "prime rate" at the large U.S.
money  center banks (the "Agreed Rate") during the period from the Closing 
Date to the date of payment. If the Working Capital reflected on the  Closing
Date Working Capital Schedule as finally determined under  SECTION
1.09(b)(iii) is greater than the Target Working Capital, then  within five
(5) Business Days following the final determination  thereof, Purchaser shall
pay to Seller, by wire transfer of  immediately available funds to the
account or accounts designated by  Seller, the amount of such excess with
interest thereon at the Agreed  Rate during the period from the Closing Date
to the date of payment.   (c) Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause
their respective  representatives to, cooperate and assist in the preparation
of the Closing  Date Working Capital Schedule and Closing Statement and the
calculation of  Working Capital and in the conduct of the review described in
this SECTION  1.09, including, without limitation, the making available to
the extent  necessary of books, records, work papers and personnel.   
4   SECTION 1.10 Inventory Verification.   (a) SECTION 1.10(a) of the
Disclosure Letter contains a preliminary  list of all of the items comprising
the Inventory on hand as of June 30,  2004 (the "Preliminary Inventory"),
which list includes the quantities of  such items on hand as of such date, as
well as the book values of such  items.   (b) Promptly following the date
hereof, in the presence of  representatives of both Seller and Purchaser, the
Company shall commence a  physical count and reconciliation of the Inventory
in accordance with the  Company\'s normal inventory procedures, as described
in the Summary of  Inventory Accounting Policies, a copy of which is set
forth in SECTION  1.10(b) of the Disclosure Letter, as of November 1, 2004
and shall prepare  an updated version of the list contained in SECTION
1.10(a) of the  Disclosure Letter reflecting the results of such physical
count and  reconciliation (the "Final Inventory"). Such physical count and 
reconciliation shall be completed as expeditiously as possible but in any 
event within thirty (30) Business Days after the date hereof (or, if 
necessary, such later time as the parties may mutually agree, but in no 
event later than seventy-five (75) Business Days after the Closing) (the 
"Inventory Verification Period"). If, upon completion of such physical 
count, the parties agree on the Final Inventory, each of them shall execute 
a certificate in writing certifying as to their agreement regarding the 
Final Inventory and attach thereto a copy of the list of the Final  Inventory
so agreed to. Any items of Inventory that cannot be used or  returned to a
usable state in accordance with the Company\'s past practices  due to
improper or missing documentation related to such items required  under
applicable Company Permits or Law shall not be included in the  determination
of the Final Inventory.   (c) If the parties are unable to agree upon the
Final Inventory on or  before the expiration of the Inventory Verification
Period, Seller on the  one hand and Purchaser on the other shall each prepare
a written statement  specifying therein in detail the basis and reason for
all disputes between  the parties regarding the determination of the Final
Inventory and the  amounts in dispute. Within five (5) Business Days after
the expiration of  the Inventory Verification Period, they shall each submit
such written  statements to the Auditors, who shall act as an arbitrator, for
resolution  of all disputes set forth in such written statements. The
Auditors shall be  instructed to use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve all disputes  as soon as practicable and in any event within twenty
(20) Business Days  after the submission to it of the parties\' written
statements. Each of the  parties shall bear all costs and expenses incurred
by it in connection with  such arbitration, and the fees of the Auditors
shall be shared equally by  Purchaser and Seller. This provision for
arbitration shall be specifically  enforceable by the parties, and the
decision of the Auditors shall be final  and binding and there shall be no
right of appeal therefrom.   (d) Within five (5) Business Days after the
date on which the Final  Inventory is finally determined in accordance with
this SECTION 1.10  (whether by agreement of the parties or by decision of the
Auditors), (i)  if the Final Inventory exceeds the aggregate book value of
the Preliminary  Inventory set forth in SECTION 1.10(a) of the Disclosure
Letter by more  than $200,000, then Purchaser shall pay Seller the amount of
such excess in  immediately available funds, or (ii) if the aggregate book
value of the  Preliminary Inventory set forth in SECTION 1.10(a) of the
Disclosure Letter  exceeds the aggregate book value of the Final Inventory by
more than  $100,000, then Seller shall pay Purchaser the amount of such
excess in  immediately available funds.    5   ARTICLE II  
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER AND THE COMPANY   Except as set
forth in a Disclosure Letter delivered by Seller and the Company concurrently
with the execution of this Agreement (the "Disclosure Letter"), Seller and
the Company hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to Purchaser
as follows:   SECTION 2.01 Organization and Qualification. Each of Seller
and the Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has
the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of Seller and
the Company is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character
of the properties owned, leased or operated by Seller or the Company, as
applicable, or the nature of their respective businesses makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As used in this
Agreement, the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means (a) a material
impairment or delay of the ability of Seller to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (b) a material adverse change in, or effect
on, the business, assets and liabilities (taken together), properties,
condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the Company;
provided, however, that (i) any adverse change or effect directly and
substantially attributable to the announcement, pendency or consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any decrease in
customer demand, any reduction in revenues, any disruption in supplier,
partner or similar relationships or any loss of employees), (ii) general
business or economic conditions affecting the economy as a whole,
(iii) conditions generally affecting the helicopter or aviation industries as
a whole and (iv) changes or developments in financial or securities markets
or the economy in general, any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or the
declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war, any acts of
terrorism, any other international or domestic calamity or crisis or
geopolitical event, or effects of weather or meteorological events shall each
be excluded from such determination.   SECTION 2.02 Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws.   (a) Seller has made available to Purchaser
complete and correct copies  of its certificate of incorporation and by-laws
and the articles of  incorporation and by-laws of the Company, in each case
as amended to the  date of this Agreement. Seller is not in violation of any
of the provisions  of its certificate of incorporation or by-laws, and the
Company is not in  violation of any of the provisions of its articles of
incorporation or  by-laws.    6   (b) The minute books of the Company
previously made available to  Purchaser contain true, correct and complete
records of all meetings and  accurately reflect all other corporate action of
the stockholders and board  of directors of the Company. The stock
certificate books and stock transfer  ledgers of the Company previously made
available to Purchaser are true,  correct and complete. All stock transfer
taxes levied or payable with  respect to all transfers of shares of the
Company prior to the date hereof  have been paid and appropriate transfer tax
stamps affixed.   SECTION 2.03 Capitalization and Ownership.   (a) The
authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 3,000  shares of Company
Common Stock. Two thousand shares of Company Common Stock  are outstanding,
all of which are validly issued, fully paid and  nonassessable. Except for
the Shares, there are no shares of capital stock  or other equity interests
in the Company issued or outstanding, and except  for this Agreement, there
are no options, warrants or other rights,  agreements, arrangements or
commitments obligating the Company to issue or  sell any shares of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, the  Company.   (b) All of the
Shares are owned of record and beneficially by Seller,  and the consummation
of the Stock Purchase will convey to Purchaser good  title to the Shares,
free and clear of all Liens (as hereinafter defined),  except for those
created by Purchaser or arising out of ownership of the  Shares by Purchaser.
Seller has the corporate power and authority to sell,  transfer, assign and
deliver the Shares as provided in this Agreement, and  such delivery will
convey to Purchaser good and marketable title to the  Shares, free and clear
of all Liens.   (c) Except as set forth on SECTION 2.03(c) of the Disclosure
Letter,  there is no existing option, warrant, call, right or contract of
any  character to which Seller or the Company is a party requiring, and

additional  shares of capital stock or other equity securities of the Company
or other  securities convertible into, exchangeable for or evidencing the
right to  subscribe for or purchase shares of capital stock or other equity

transactions contemplated thereby by Seller and the  Company will not, (i)
conflict with or violate the certificate of  incorporation or by-laws of
Seller or the articles of incorporation or  by-laws of the Company or (ii)
except as set forth in SECTION 2.05(a) of  the Disclosure Letter and assuming
that all consents, approvals,  authorizations and other actions described in
SECTION 2.05(b) have been  obtained and all filings and obligations described
in SECTION 2.05(b) have  been made, conflict with or result in any violation
of or default (with or  without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or
give rise to a right of  termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation or loss of a  benefit under, or give rise to any obligation of the
Company to make any  payment under, or to the increased, additional,
accelerated or guaranteed  rights or entitlements of any Person under, or
result in the creation of  any Liens upon any of the properties or assets of
the Company under, any  provision of (A) any contract, or permit to which the
Company is a party or  by which any of the properties or assets of the
Company are bound; (B) any  Order of any Governmental Entity applicable to
the Company or any of the  properties or assets of the Company as of the date
hereof; or (C) any  applicable Law, except, with respect to clause (ii), for
any such  conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, or other occurrences as
would  not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse  Effect.   (b) Except as set forth in SECTION 2.05(b) of the
Disclosure Letter,  the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents
by Seller do not,  and the performance of them by Seller will not, require
any consent,  approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to,  any Governmental Entity, except (i) for applicable
requirements, if any, of  state securities or "blue sky" Laws ("Blue Sky
Laws") and the pre-merger  notification requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements  Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder ("HSR  Act"), (ii) notices to, filings with or
approvals of the U.S. Federal  Aviation Administration ("FAA") required under
applicable Law, if any,  (iii) notices to, filings with or approvals of the
U.S. Department of  Transportation ("DOT") required under applicable Law, if
any and (iv) where  failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or  to make such filings or notifications, would
not prevent or delay  consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents,  or otherwise prevent Seller from performing its
obligations under the  Transaction Documents, and would not, individually or
in the aggregate,  have a Company Material Adverse Effect.    8  
SECTION 2.06 Company Permits; Compliance With Laws.   (a) The Company is in
possession of, and (assuming that all consents,  approvals, authorizations
and other actions described in SECTION 2.05(b)  have been obtained and all
filings and obligations described in SECTION  2.05(b) have been made)

applicable thereto.   (b) The Company is not in conflict with, or in default
or violation  of, and there has been no event that with the giving of notice
or the lapse  of time or both would become a default or violation of, in any
material  respect (i) any Law applicable to the Company or by which any
property or  asset of the Company is bound or affected, nor has it received
notice of or  been charged with such, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company or
Seller, is  the Company under investigation for any such violation, (ii) any
note,  bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license,
franchise  or other instrument or obligation to which the Company is a party
or by  which the Company or any property or asset of the Company is bound
or  affected or (iii) any Company Permits.   SECTION 2.07 Financial

otherwise disclosed  herein or in SECTION 2.07(c) of the Disclosure Letter or
(iii) for  executory obligations existing as of the date of the Company
Financial  Statements that arose in the ordinary course of business
consistent with  past practice under contracts and agreements and that are
disclosed in  SECTION 2.08 of the Disclosure Letter (or to contracts or

Letter by the  terms of SECTION 2.08 of this Agreement), all liabilities and
obligations  of the Company (whether direct, indirect, accrued, contingent or
otherwise)  that would be required to be reflected or reserved against in the

are so  reflected or reserved against in such balance sheet of the
Company.   SECTION 2.08 Material Contracts.   (a) SECTION 2.08 of the

any Material  Contract, nor, to the Knowledge of Seller or the Company, is
any other  party to any Material Contract in default thereunder, and no event

determination  letter and (iv) the most recently prepared actuarial report

legally binding arrangement  that would constitute a commitment to create any
additional Company Plan or  to modify any existing Company Plan (other than
with respect to a  modification, change or termination required by ERISA or
the Code).   (d) Except as set forth in SECTION 2.11(d) of the Disclosure
Letter,  neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation  of the Stock Purchase will (i) result in any payment becoming
due to any  Employee, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
Company  Plan or (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting  of any such benefits under any such Company Plan.   (e) None of
the Company Plans is a multiemployer plan, within the  meaning of Section
3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan")  nor will the Company
have any obligation to make any contribution to any  Multiemployer Plan. None
of the Company Plans is a single employer pension  plan, within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, for which the  Company could incur liability
under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a  "Multiple Employer Plan"). With
respect to each Company Plan, neither the  Company nor any trade or business,
whether or not incorporated, that  together with the Company would be deemed
a "single employer" within the  meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA has made
or suffered a "complete  withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" as such terms
are respectively  defined in Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA (or any
liability resulting  therefrom has been satisfied in full).   (f) Except as

Seller\'s Knowledge, there has been no  non-exempt prohibited transaction

with respect to any Company Plan, which  could reasonably be expected to give
rise to liability of the Company equal  to or greater than $500,000 in the
aggregate. The Company is not currently  liable and has not previously
incurred any liability for any tax or penalty  arising under Section 4971,
4972, 4979, 4980 or 4980B of the Code or  Section 502(c) of ERISA which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to  liability of the Company equal to or
greater than $500,000 in the  aggregate, and to the Company or Seller\'s
Knowledge, no fact or event  exists which could reasonably be expected to
give rise to any such  liability.    14   (h) Except as set forth in
SECTION 2.11(h) of the Disclosure Letter,  there are no pending actions,
claims or lawsuits which have been asserted  or instituted relating to the
Company Plans, the assets of any of the  trusts under such plans or the
sponsor, administrator or fiduciary of any  of the Company Plans, with
respect to the operation of such plans (other  than routine benefit claims
which could not reasonably be expected to  result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect), nor does the Company have any  Knowledge of facts that could
form the basis for any such claim or lawsuit.   (i) Except as set forth in
SECTION 2.11(i) of the Disclosure Letter,  none of the Company Plans provide
for post-employment life or health  insurance, benefits or coverage for any
participant or any beneficiary of a  participant, except as may be required
under the Consolidate Omnibus Budget  Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended
("COBRA").   (j) The Company has not incurred any liability under, arising
out of  or by operation of Title IV of ERISA that has not been satisfied in
full  (other than liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation ("PBGC") arising in the ordinary course), including, without 
limitation, any liability in connection with the termination or 
reorganization of any employee pension benefit plan subject to Title IV of 
ERISA maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate (as defined at the 
end of this paragraph) or to which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate 
contributed or has ever been obligated to contribute thereunder (a "Title  IV
Plan"). With respect to the Title IV Plans, (i) no complete or partial 
termination has occurred within the five (5) years preceding the date of 
this Agreement with respect to any Title IV Plan, (ii) no reportable event 
(within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the 30-day notice 
requirement to the PBGC has not been waived has occurred or is expected to 
occur with respect to any Title IV Plans, (iii) no asset of the Company is 
the subject of any lien arising under Section 302(f) of ERISA or Section 
412(n) of the Code, (iv) the Company has not been required to post any 
security under Section 307 of ERISA or Section 401(a)(29) of the Code and 
(v) no fact or event exists which would give rise to any such lien or 
requirement to post any such security, which could, in each of (i)-(v) 
listed above, reasonably be expected to give rise to liability of the 
Company equal to or greater than $500,000 in the aggregate. An "ERISA 
Affiliate" shall mean any Affiliate of the Company and any trade or  business
(whether or not incorporated) which is or has ever been under  common
control, or which is or has ever been treated as a single employer,  with any
of them under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.   (k) The Company
Plans have been maintained, in all material respects,  in accordance with
their terms and with the requirements of all applicable  Laws, including,
without limitation, ERISA and the Code, except for such  Law violations as
could not reasonably be expected to give rise to  liability of the Company
equal to or greater than $500,000 in the  aggregate. To the Knowledge of
Seller or the Company, nothing has occurred  with respect to the operation of
the Company Plans that would reasonably be  expected to cause the imposition
to the Company of any liabilities,  penalties or taxes under ERISA or the
Code which, in the aggregate, could  reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.    15   (l) The Company has not incurred
any liability under, and has complied  in all respects with all applicable
Laws relating to the employment of  labor, including all such applicable Laws
relating to wages, hours, WARN,  collective bargaining, discrimination, civil
rights, safety and health,  workers\' compensation and the collection and
payment of withholding and/or  social security taxes and any similar tax,
except for immaterial  non-compliance. The Company does not reasonably expect
to incur any such  liability as a result of actions taken or not taken prior
to the Closing.  SECTION 2.11(l) of the Disclosure Letter lists all notices
given by the  Company in connection with WARN.   (m) (i) The Company is not
a party to any collective bargaining  agreement or other labor union contract
applicable to Persons employed by  the Company, nor, to the Knowledge of
Seller and the Company, are there any  activities or proceedings of any labor
union to organize any such  employees; (ii) the Company has not breached or
otherwise failed to comply  with any provision of any such agreement or
contract, and there are no  grievances outstanding against the Company under
any such agreement or  contract; (iii) there are no unfair labor practice
complaints pending  against the Company before the National Labor Relations
Board or any  current union representation questions involving employees of
the Company;  and (iv) there is no strike, slowdown, work stoppage or
lockout, or, to the  Knowledge of Seller and the Company, threat thereof, by
or with respect to  any employees of the Company.   SECTION 2.12 Taxes.

complete in all material respects. All Taxes shown due on  such returns and
all other material amounts of Taxes (whether or not  required to be shown on
a Tax Return) payable by or with respect to the  Company (or any Affiliated
Group of which the Company is or was a member)  have been timely paid or
accrued on the Company Financial Statements.   (b) SECTION 2.12(b) of the
Disclosure Letter lists all income and  other material Tax Returns filed with

Letter,  neither the Company nor any Person on its behalf has waived any
statute of  limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to, or become a party
to, any  extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency or

forth in SECTION 2.12(d) of the Disclosure Letter,  the Company is not a
party to any pending action or proceeding, and,  neither Seller nor the
Company has received any written notice that there  is any action or

Company has not been a member of any Affiliated Group other  than the
Affiliated Group of which Seller is the common parent, and the  Company does

Section 1.1502-6 or any comparable provision of state, local or  foreign Law
(other than as a member of such group).   (f) The Company has withheld or
collected and timely paid over to the  appropriate Governmental Entity (or is

true,  correct and complete list of all individuals who are employed by the 
Company on a full-time, permanent or part time basis principally at or with 
respect to the Business of the Company as of the date of this Agreement 
(such individuals, together with any individuals who may be added to such 
list prior to the Closing Date in accordance with this SECTION 4.07(a) are 
collectively referred to herein as the "Company Employees"). Any
employee    35   of the Company who is not actively at work on the

entitled to  re-employment rights under the Uniformed Services Employment
and  Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended ("USERRA") or other

Date,  such list shall be updated to reflect any additional individuals who
become  Company Employees in the ordinary course of the conduct of the
Company\'s  business after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing Date.   (b) Seller and the Company shall take all necessary action

connection therewith, Seller shall timely provide all Company Employees  with
any notices required under Code Section 4980F and shall, or shall  cause the
Company to, give notice to all affected Company Employees that  their active
participation in the Company Plans shall terminate on the  Closing Date, or
such other date as may be set forth in a Transition  Services Agreement (the

shall be made available to each Company  Employee when, and on the same terms
and conditions, such Purchaser  Employee Benefit Plan would be made available
to an employee of Purchaser  or Purchaser\'s Affiliates who is similarly
situated to the Company  Employee. Purchaser and Purchaser Employee Benefit
Plans shall recognize  (A) each Company Employee\'s years of service prior to
the Closing Date with  Seller and the Company (including service with any
other employer that was  recognized by Seller or the Companies) for purposes
of eligibility and  vesting, (B) the amount of annual vacation time for each
Company Employee  under Purchaser\'s vacation policy to which a similarly
situated employee of  Purchaser or Purchaser\'s Affiliates would be entitled
and (C) such service  of each Company Employee for all other purposes for
which such service is  either taken into account or recognized; provided,
however, that such  service shall not be credited for purposes of benefit
accrual or level of  benefits or to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits.  Purchaser and Purchaser Employee Benefit Plans
shall also recognize and  comply with all reemployment rights and service
crediting provisions of  USERRA and other applicable Laws for purposes of
this SECTION 4.07(b).    36   (c) Effective as of the Closing, the
Company and Purchaser shall  assume and perform all of the obligations and
liabilities of Seller under  the severance benefit plans and retention bonus
award agreements of Seller  or the Company attached to SECTION 4.07(c) of the
Disclosure Letter in  accordance with the terms and conditions of such plans
and agreements.  Purchaser shall be responsible for and assume all liability
for all notices  or payments due to any Company Employees, and all notices,
payments, fines  or assessments due to any Governmental Entity, under any
applicable Law  with respect to the employment, discharge or layoff of
employees by the  Company or Purchaser after the Closing Date, including WARN
and any rules  or regulations as have been issued in connection with the
foregoing.   (d) Seller agrees to cooperate with Purchaser in connection
with any  and all notifications, benefits and liabilities to any Company
Employee and  Governmental Entities under WARN or any other applicable Law

on or after the  Closing Date.   (e) Purchaser agrees that upon the
Transition Date, each Company  Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting  time, in a group health plan, as defined in
Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code  of Purchaser or Purchaser\'s Affiliates
("Purchaser Medical Plan").  Purchaser agrees that the Purchaser Medical Plan
shall (i) credit each  Company Employee towards the deductibles, coinsurance
and maximum  out-of-pocket provisions imposed under such group health plan,
for the plan  year during which the Closing Date occurs, with any applicable
expenses  already incurred during the portion of the year preceding the
Closing Date  under the applicable group health plans of Seller and (ii)
waive any  preexisting condition restriction which was waived under the terms
of any  analogous Company Plan. Seller shall be exclusively responsible for 
complying with COBRA with respect to employees of the Company and their 
eligible dependents by reason of such employee\'s termination of employment 
or other qualifying event on or prior to the Closing Date, and Purchaser 
shall be exclusively responsible for complying with COBRA with respect to 
any such termination of employment or other qualifying event after the 
Closing Date.   (f) Except as may be otherwise provided in this Agreement or
in a  Transition Services Agreement, Seller shall retain all responsibility
for  the Company Plans, and Seller and the Company Plans, as applicable,
shall  be responsible and liable for benefits incurred or accrued under the 
Company Plans in accordance with their terms and provisions by the Company 
Employees prior to the Closing.   (g) Seller agrees to indemnify Purchaser
and its affiliates,  directors, officers and employees with respect to any
loss, liability,  damage, fine, expense, penalty, assessment (including but
not limited to  funding deficiency assessments and Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation  liability assessments), judgments, benefit claims, breach of
fiduciary duty  damages or prohibited transaction penalties (including any
and all costs  and fees relating to any legal proceedings in connection
therewith and  including attorneys\' fees, costs and expenses of enforcing
this indemnity  against Seller) with respect to any Company Plan which is
subject to Title    37   IV of ERISA and with respect to any other
employee benefit plan, as such  term is described in Section 3(3) of ERISA
which is subject to Title IV of  ERISA and which is not a Company Plan but
which was sponsored, maintained  or contributed to by any of Seller or any
corporation, trade, business or  entity under common control with Seller
within the meaning of Section  414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code; provided,
however, that nothing in this  SECTION 4.07(g) shall be construed or
interpreted to relieve Purchaser of  any employee benefit liability or
obligation specifically and expressly  assumed or agreed to by Purchaser
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  The provisions set forth in this

event of a conflict between the provisions of  this SECTION 4.07(g), on the
one hand, and the provisions of ARTICLE VII  hereof, on the other, the

doubt, any claim arising out of or relating to a  breach of a representation

VII, and not by this SECTION 4.07(g).   (h) Seller and any Affiliates (other
than the Company) shall be solely  responsible for claims for workers\'
compensation that are incurred on or  prior to the Closing Date and Purchaser
shall be solely responsible (or  cause the Company, if applicable, to assume
and become solely responsible)  for claims for workers\' compensation that
are incurred with respect to any  Company Employee after the Closing
Date.   (i) Seller agrees to furnish Purchaser with such information 
concerning employees, employee payroll and employee benefit plans, subject 
to confidentiality and privacy considerations, and to take all such other 
action, as is necessary and appropriate to effectuate the transactions

upon any of the  employees of Seller, Purchaser, the Company, or any of their
Affiliates,  any rights or remedies, including any right to benefits or
employment, or  continued benefits or employment, for any specified period,

SECTION 4.08 Tax Matters.   (a) Seller shall be responsible for, and shall
defend, reimburse,  indemnify, and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnitees
against and in  respect of all Purchaser Damages that may be incurred by or
imposed on any  Purchaser Indemnitee as a result of or arising out of: (A)
all Taxes of the  Company for any taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date, (B)  if applicable law does not permit the Company to close its
taxable year on    38   the Closing Date or in any case in which a Tax is
assessed with respect to  a taxable period which includes the Closing Date
(but does not begin or end  on that day) (a "Straddle Period"), all Taxes of
the Company allocable to  the portion of such period ending on the Closing
Date, as determined in  accordance with SECTION 4.08(d), (C) all Taxes
imposed on any member of an  Affiliated Group of which the Company is or was
a member on or prior to the  Closing Date by reason of the liability of the

predecessor or successor thereof or  any analogous or similar provision under
state, local or foreign Law), (D)  any Taxes directly resulting from the
Section 338(h)(10) Election, (E)  Seller\'s failure to perform any covenant
with respect to Taxes contained in  this Agreement or any other Transaction
Documents and (F) a breach of any  representation or warranty contained in
SECTION 2.12(r), other than, in the  case of each of subsections (A) through
(E) above, the amount of Tax  actually taken into account as, and increasing,
current liabilities in  calculating the Working Capital adjustment (excluding
any provisions for  deferred Taxes established to reflect differences between
the treatment of  items for accounting and income tax purposes).   (b)
Purchaser shall be responsible for, and shall defend, reimburse,  indemnify,
and hold harmless Seller Indemnitees against and in respect of,  all Seller
Damages that may be incurred by or imposed on any Seller  Indemnitee as a
result of or arising out of (except to the extent resulting  from a breach of
any representation or warranty contained in Section 2.12):  (A) all Taxes of
the Company for any taxable period beginning after the  Closing Date, (B)
with respect to any Straddle Period, all Taxes of the  Company allocable to
the post-Closing Date portion of such period, as  determined in accordance
with SECTION 4.08(d), (C) the Purchaser\'s failure  to perform any covenant
with respect to Taxes contained in this Agreement  or any other Transaction
Documents and (D) all Taxes taken into account as  current liabilities in
calculating the Working Capital adjustment  (excluding any provisions for
deferred Taxes established to reflect  differences between the treatment of
items for accounting and tax  purposes).   (c) Any Tax Return to be
prepared pursuant to the provisions of this  SECTION 4.08(c) shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with practices  followed in prior years with
respect to similar Tax Returns, except for  changes required by changes in
applicable Law or fact or as required to  make or reflect the Section
338(h)(10) Election. Purchaser shall not file  an amended Tax Return for the
Company for any period ending on or before  the Closing Date without the
consent of Seller, which consent may not be  unreasonably withheld. The
following provisions shall govern the allocation  of responsibility as
between Purchaser and Seller for certain Tax matters:   (i) Seller shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file  or cause to be timely filed
(A) all Tax Returns for the Company  required to be filed (taking into
account extensions) on or prior to  the Closing Date and (B) all Tax Returns
of the Company that are filed  on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis
with Seller or any  Affiliate of Seller for all periods ending on or before
the Closing  Date regardless of when they are to be filed, including the 
consolidated federal income Tax Return of the Seller Affiliated Group  for
the taxable period which includes the Closing Date which return  shall
include the Company for its taxable period ending on the Closing  Date.
Seller will permit Purchaser to review and comment on the  portions of such
Tax Returns (and underlying work papers) described in  the preceding sentence
to the extent they relate to the Company prior  to filing. Seller shall pay
the Taxes attributable to the Company with  respect to such periods.   
39   (ii) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and timely  file
or cause to be timely filed all other Tax Returns of the Company  for Tax
periods which begin before the Closing Date and end after the  Closing Date.
Purchaser will permit Seller to review and comment on  each such Tax Return
described in the preceding sentence prior to  filing, and Seller shall not be
required to pay Purchaser or indemnify  any Purchaser Indemnitee for Taxes to
the extent they result from  Purchaser\'s failure to make revisions to such
Tax Returns that are  reasonably requested by Seller. Seller and Purchaser
shall attempt in  good faith to resolve any disagreements regarding such Tax
Returns  prior to the due date for filing. The determination whether the 
request for such revisions was reasonable shall be determined by an 
independent accounting firm chosen and retained by mutual agreement of 
Seller and Purchaser, the fees and expenses of which shall be paid  one-half
by Seller and one-half by Purchaser. Seller shall pay to  Purchaser within
fifteen (15) days of filing any Tax Return required  to be filed by Purchaser
pursuant to this SECTION 4.08(c)(ii), an  amount equal to the Taxes which
relates to the portion of the Tax  period covered by such return that ends on
the Closing Date and are  not reflected on the Closing Statement.   (d) To
the extent permitted by applicable Law or administrative  practice, the
taxable year of the Company shall end on and include the  Closing Date. If
applicable Law or administrative practice does not permit  the Company to
close its taxable year on the Closing Date, then with  respect to any
Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes for the  portion of the year
or period ending on, and the portion of the year or  period beginning after,
the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes  based upon or related to
income or gross receipts, be determined by  assuming that the taxable year or
period ended on and included the Closing  Date and (ii) in the case of any
Taxes other than Taxes based upon or  related to income or gross receipts, be
deemed to be the amount of such  Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator  of which is the number of days in the
portion of the Straddle Period ending  on the Closing Date or beginning after
the Closing Date, as applicable, and  the denominator of which is the number
of days in the entire Straddle  Period, except that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are  calculated on an annual basis and annual property Taxes
shall be prorated  on the basis of the number of days in the annual period
elapsed through the  Closing Date as compared to the number of days in the
annual period  elapsing after the Closing Date.   (e) After the Closing
Date, Seller shall grant to Purchaser (or its  designees) access at all
reasonable times to all of the information, books,  and records relating to
the Company within the possession of Seller  (including work papers and
correspondence with taxing authorities), and  shall afford Purchaser (or its
designees) the right (at Purchaser\'s  expense) to take extracts therefrom
and to make copies thereof, to the  extent reasonably necessary to permit
Purchaser (or its designees) to    40   prepare Tax Returns and to
conduct negotiations with taxing authorities.  After the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall grant or cause the Company to grant  to Seller (or its
designees) access at all reasonable times to all of the  information, books
and records relating to the Company within the  possession of Purchaser or
the Company (including work papers and  correspondence with taxing
authorities), and shall afford Seller (or its  designees) the right (at
Seller\'s expense) to take extracts therefrom and  to make copies thereof, to
the extent reasonably necessary to permit Seller  (or its designees) to
prepare Tax Returns and to conduct negotiations with  taxing authorities.  
(f) Seller shall be responsible for the payment of all excise, sales,  use,
transfer (including real property transfer or gains), stamp,  documentary,
filing, recordation and other similar Taxes, together with any  interest,
additions or penalties with respect thereto and any interest in  respect of
such additions or penalties, resulting directly from the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (g) On or before the Closing Date, Seller
shall ensure that no Tax  indemnity agreement, Tax allocation agreement or
Tax sharing agreement with  respect to the Company is in force or effect as
to the Company and that  there shall be no liability of the Company after the
Closing Date under any  such agreement.   (h) Refunds of Taxes paid or
payable with respect to Taxes  attributable to the Company shall be promptly
paid as follows (or to the  extent payable but not paid due to offset against
other Taxes shall be  promptly paid by the party receiving the benefit of the
offset as follows):  (i) to Seller if attributable to Taxes with respect to
any Tax year or  portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date (or for
any Tax year  beginning before and ending after the Closing Date to the
extent allocable  (determined in a manner consistent with SECTION 4.08(d)) to
the portion of  such period beginning before and ending on the Closing Date
(other than if  attributable to the amount of Tax refunds or credits actually
taken into  account as, and increasing, current assets in calculating the
Working  Capital adjustment); and (ii) to Purchaser if attributable to Taxes
with  respect to any Tax year or portion thereof beginning after the Closing
Date  (or for any Tax year beginning before and ending after the Closing Date
to  the extent allocable (determined in a manner consistent with SECTION 
4.08(d)) to the portion of such period ending after the Closing Date).   (i)
After the Closing Date, in the case of any audit, examination, or  other
proceeding with respect to Taxes ("Tax Proceeding") for periods  ending on or
before the Closing Date, Purchaser shall inform Seller within  ten (10) days
of the receipt of any notice of such Tax Proceeding, and  shall afford
Seller, at Seller\'s expense, the opportunity to control the  conduct of such
Tax Proceeding. Purchaser shall execute or cause to be  executed powers of
attorney or other documents necessary to enable Seller  to take all
reasonable actions desired by Seller with respect to such Tax  Proceeding.
Seller shall have the right to control any such Tax Proceeding    41  
and to initiate any claim for refund, file any amended return or take any 
other action which it deems appropriate with respect to such Taxes. After 
the Closing Date, in the case of any Tax Proceeding for periods beginning 
after the Closing Date, Seller shall inform Purchaser within ten (10) days 
of the receipt of any notice of such Tax Proceeding, and shall afford 
Purchaser, at Purchaser\'s expense, the opportunity to control the conduct 
of such Tax Proceeding. Seller shall execute or cause to be executed powers 
of attorney or other documents necessary to enable Purchaser to take all 
reasonable actions desired by Purchaser with respect to such Tax  Proceeding.
Purchaser shall have the right to control any such Tax  Proceeding and to
initiate any claim for refund, file any amended return or  take any other
action which it deems appropriate with respect to such  Taxes. Seller and
Purchaser shall jointly control any Tax Proceeding for  periods beginning on
or before the Closing Date and ending after the  Closing Date. The failure of
any party to give the other party notice as  provided in this SECTION 4.08(i)
shall not relieve such other party of its  obligations under this SECTION
4.08 except to the extent that such other  party is materially prejudiced by
such failure to give notice.   (j) Seller shall join Purchaser in making a
timely, irrevocable and  effective election under section 338(h)(10) of the
Code (and any comparable  elections under state, local or foreign Tax law)
(collectively, the  "Section 338(h)(10) Election") with respect to the
acquisition of the  Shares by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement. Prior to
the due date for  filing IRS Form 8023 and any similar forms under applicable
income Tax Law  (the "Forms"), Purchaser and Seller shall cause the Forms to
be duly  executed by an authorized Person for Purchaser and Seller,
respectively.  Purchaser shall duly and timely file the Forms as prescribed
by Treasury  Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 or the corresponding
provisions of  applicable income Tax Law. Purchaser and Seller agree that the
Purchase  Price and the liabilities of the Company (plus other relevant
items) shall  be allocated among the assets of the Company for Tax purposes
in the manner  required under section 338 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations  promulgated thereunder. Purchaser and Seller shall endeavor in
good faith  to reach timely agreement on such allocation; provided, however,
that if  Purchaser and Seller have not reached agreement on such allocation
by the  seventy-fifth (75th) Business Day after the Closing Date, then such 
allocation shall be made in accordance with the appraisal of a recognized 
appraisal firm chosen and retained by mutual agreement of Seller and 
Purchaser, the fees and expenses of which shall be paid one-half by Seller 
and one-half by Purchaser. Purchaser, Seller and the Company shall duly and 
timely file the Forms and all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8883) in a 
manner consistent with the two preceding sentences and shall not take a 
position before any Governmental Entity or otherwise inconsistent  therewith.
Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other in the  making of the
Section 338(h)(10) Election.   (k) The provisions set forth in this SECTION
4.08: (A) shall survive  the Closing hereunder until sixty (60) days after
the expiration of the  applicable statute of limitations (including any valid
extensions thereof,  whether automatic or permissive); (B) shall not be
subject to any of the  limitations on indemnification set forth in SECTION
7.02 of this Agreement;  and (C) the indemnification provided for in SECTION
4.08(a) and SECTION  4.08(b) shall be the sole remedy for any claim in
respect of any Taxes  described in SECTION 4.08(a) or SECTION 4.08(b), as
applicable, and in the  event of a conflict between the provisions of this
SECTION 4.08, on the one  hand, and the provisions of ARTICLE VII hereof, on
the other, the  provisions of this SECTION 4.08 shall control. For the
avoidance of doubt,  any claim arising out of or relating to a breach of a
representation or  warranty contained in SECTION 2.12 that is not otherwise
covered in this  SECTION 4.08 shall be governed exclusively by the provisions
of ARTICLE  VII, and not by this SECTION 4.08.    42   SECTION 4.09
Purchaser\'s Use of Name. Purchaser agrees that promptly following the
Closing Date, it will not use and will cause the Company to cease using any
reference to the names of Seller or any of Seller\'s Affiliates (other than

in accordance with applicable Laws, any assumed name or similar certificates
or documents of the Company on file with any Governmental Entities that would
be inconsistent with the immediately preceding sentence.   SECTION 4.10

time, and from time to time, prior to the Closing, the  Company may transfer,
and Seller may cause the Company to transfer, to  Seller or an Affiliate or

Closing, Seller may transfer or cause to be  transferred from the Company to
Seller or an Affiliate or Affiliates of  Seller designated by Seller the

4.12 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. Each of Seller, the Company and
Purchaser shall cooperate, and use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 4.13
Public Announcements. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law or stock
exchange requirements, Seller and Purchaser shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby, and
neither Seller nor Purchaser shall issue any such press release or make any
such public statement without the other\'s prior express consent.    43  
SECTION 4.14 Notification of Certain Matters. In the event that, at any time
prior to the Closing, any party hereto acquires Knowledge of any
event, condition, fact or circumstance that, if existing or known to such
party or any other party hereto as of the date hereof, would have been
required to be set forth or described in the Disclosure Letter or the
Purchaser Disclosure Letter or would otherwise have rendered any
representation or warranty of any party contained in ARTICLE II or ARTICLE
III of this Agreement untrue, such party shall promptly (but in any event
prior to the Closing) provide written notice of such event, condition, fact
or circumstance to each other party, which notice shall also state whether
such party believes such event, condition, fact or circumstance is, or if not
cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of same from the
appropriate party, would become, a Terminating Seller Breach or a Terminating
Purchaser Breach. However, no such written notice shall be deemed to cure any
breach of any such representation or warranty, whether for purposes
of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in ARTICLE V have
been satisfied or otherwise, unless otherwise agreed in writing by all of the
parties hereto.   SECTION 4.15 Additional Agreements.   (a) At or before

flight service providers, (iii) cancelable by Seller  upon thirty (30) days
written notice in the event of material  non-performance by the Company and
(iv) otherwise be in form and substance  mutually agreeable to Seller and
Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt,  neither the failure by the Company to
have suitable aircraft timely  available nor the failure of the Company\'s
prices for such services to be  competitive with prices available from other
third party flight service  providers shall be deemed to be "material non-
performance by the Company"  for purposes of terminating the master services
agreement; provided,  however, that in such events, Seller will have no
obligation under the  master services agreement to obtain flight services
from the Company so  long as such conditions exist.   (b) At or before the
Closing, Seller shall cause Rowan Marine  Services, Inc., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Seller ("Rowan Marine"), to  enter into a sublease agreement

amended and assigned to Rowan Marine),  including a hangar building and

equal to $2,500 per month, which sublease  shall be in form and substance
mutually agreeable to Seller and Purchaser.   (c) Purchaser and Seller agree
to negotiate in good faith to attempt  to reach an agreement pursuant to

Sportfisherman boat designated as the "M/V  Salsa" and the 1998 Artigiana
Battelli inflatable skiff located thereon  owned by Seller, on an as-is
where-is basis, for a price and on other terms  and conditions as may be
mutually agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser;  provided, however, that
Purchaser shall have no obligation to purchase, and  Seller shall have no
obligation to sell, such vessels by reason of this  SECTION 4.15(c) or any
other provision of this Agreement.    44   SECTION 4.16 Merrill Field
Leasehold Interest.   (a) In the event that prior to the Closing, the
Company and the  University of Alaska ("U of A") shall not have completed the
sale of  certain leasehold interests and improvements thereon held by the
Company  and located at Merrill Field in Anchorage, Alaska (the "Merrill
Field  Leasehold Interest"), contemplated by that certain letter agreement

expenses incurred by the Company in respect of such  transaction.
Additionally, if such transaction is consummated, Seller shall  indemnify and
hold the Company and Purchaser harmless from and against all  indemnification
obligations incurred by the Company under the U of A Letter  Agreement for
environmental contamination of the leased premises existing  as of the date
such transaction is consummated. Such indemnification shall  not be subject
to the limitations set forth in SECTION 7.02(b)(ii), (iii),  (iv) or (v), nor
shall any indemnification made pursuant to this SECTION  4.16(a) be
considered or included in determining whether the Deductible  Amount has been
reached or exceeded for purposes of any indemnification  under SECTION
7.02(a).   (b) In the event that the sale transaction contemplated by the U
of A  Letter Agreement is not consummated within six (6) months after the 
Closing, the Company shall, and Purchaser shall, at the Company\'s option, 
cause the Company to either (i) pay to Seller an amount equal to the 
appraised fair value of the Merrill Field Leasehold Interest, as determined 
by an appraiser mutually acceptable to Seller on the one hand and the 
Company and Purchaser on the other or (ii) convey the Merrill Field 
Leasehold Interest to Seller at no cost to Seller, in either case except  for
any out-of-pocket third party expenses or Taxes incurred by the Company  in
respect of such transaction, which shall be reimbursed by Seller.   SECTION

more subsidiaries, engage or become engaged in, or assist any other Person in
engaging or becoming engaged in any business located or doing business
anywhere the Company is conducting or planning to conduct business as of the
Closing Date that is competitive with the businesses of the Company,
as conducted and planned to be conducted as of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that nothing in this SECTION 4.17 shall prohibit Seller or any of

a diversified investment company or a passive owner of less than five percent
(5%) of the outstanding stock of any class of a corporation that is publicly
traded and that competes with the business of the Company, so long as Seller
or such Affiliate has no active participation in the business of such
corporation. The parties hereto specifically acknowledge and agree that the
remedy at law for any breach of the foregoing will be inadequate and that
Purchaser, in addition to any other relief available to it, shall be entitled
to temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving
actual damage or posting any bond whatsoever. The parties hereto agree that
if any court of competent jurisdiction in a final nonappealable judgment
determines that the time period, geographical area, business limitation or
any other relevant feature of this SECTION 4.17 is unreasonable, arbitrary or
against public policy, then a lesser period of time, geographical area,
business limitation or other relevant feature which is determined to be
reasonable, not arbitrary and not against public policy may be enforced
against Seller.   SECTION 4.18 Indemnification For Certain Matters in
Disclosure Letter. Seller shall indemnify and hold the Company and Purchaser
harmless from and against all Purchaser Damages not covered by insurance
arising out of or resulting from (i) any of the matters identified in SECTION

survive the Closing until sixty (60) days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations related to such matters (including any
valid extensions thereof, whether automatic or permissive). The
indemnification provided for in this SECTION 4.18 shall not be subject to the
limitations on indemnification set forth in SECTION 7.02(b)(ii), (iii), (iv)
or (v) of this Agreement, nor shall any indemnification made pursuant to this
SECTION 4.18 be considered or included in determining whether the Deductible
Amount has been reached or exceeded for purposes of any indemnification under
SECTION 7.02(a). The indemnification provided for in this SECTION 4.18 shall
be the sole remedy for any claim in respect of the matters described in this
SECTION 4.18, and in the event of a conflict between the provisions of this
SECTION 4.18, on the one hand, and the provisions of ARTICLE VII hereof, on
the other, the provisions of this SECTION 4.18 shall control.   ARTICLE

advised by the FAA or the DOT  of any issues that could reasonably be
expected to materially and adversely  affect the ability of the Company to
operate the Business substantially as  it is currently conducted.   ARTICLE
VI   TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER   SECTION 6.01 Termination. This
Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing, notwithstanding any requisite
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, as follows:   (a) by mutual written consent of Seller and
Purchaser;   (b) by either Seller or Purchaser, if the Closing shall not
have  occurred on or before December 31, 2004 (the "Termination Date");
provided,  however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
SECTION  6.01(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill
any  obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in,
the  failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Termination Date;  
(c) by either Seller or Purchaser, if any court of competent  jurisdiction in
the United States or any other Governmental Entity, based  otherwise than on
any applicable antitrust Law, (i) shall have issued an  Order or taken any

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and  such Order or other action
shall have become final and nonappealable or  (ii) shall have failed to issue
an Order or to take any other action  necessary to fulfill the conditions to
the Closing, and such denial of a  request to issue such Order or take such
other action shall have become  final and nonappealable;    48   (d) by
Purchaser by written notice to Seller upon a material breach of  any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Seller  set
forth in this Agreement, which would give rise to a failure of a  condition
set forth in SECTION 5.01 or SECTION 5.03 and is incapable of  being cured
or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within  thirty (30)
days after written notice of such breach is given to Seller by  Purchaser (a
"Terminating Seller Breach");   (e) by Seller by written notice to Purchaser
upon a material breach of  any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of  Purchaser set forth in this Agreement which would
give rise to a failure of  a condition set forth in SECTION 5.01 or SECTION
5.02 and is incapable of  being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall
not have been cured within  thirty (30) days after written notice of such
breach is given to Purchaser  by Seller (a "Terminating Purchaser Breach");
and   (f) by Purchaser pursuant to SECTION 6.06(c).   SECTION 6.02 Effect
of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to
SECTION 6.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and, except as
provided in SECTION 6.05, there shall be no liability under this Agreement on
the part of Seller or Purchaser, or any of their respective officers or
directors, and all rights and obligations of each party hereto shall cease,
except for those set forth in this SECTION 6.02 and in SECTION 6.05, SECTION
8.05, and SECTION 8.06; provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve
any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement; and
provided further, that if this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser pursuant
to SECTION 6.01(d), Seller, in addition to any other liabilities arising
hereunder, shall be liable for and shall pay within five (5) Business Days
after receipt by Seller of a written invoice therefor the cost of all filing
and other fees paid by Purchaser in respect of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement up to a maximum aggregate amount of $500,000.   SECTION
6.03 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by action

prior to the Closing. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto.   SECTION

extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of any
other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (c) waive compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby.   SECTION 6.05
Fees and Expenses. Except as set forth in this SECTION 6.05, all expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
are consummated, except that Purchaser shall pay all filing fees incurred in
connection with the premerger notification requirements of the HSR Act.   
49  "Expenses" as used in this Agreement shall include all reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants,
investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party hereto and its
Affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with or
related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement.   SECTION 6.06 Risk of Loss.   (a) In the
event of the total destruction of any Aircraft prior to  Closing, the Company
shall promptly notify Purchaser of such destruction,  and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the insured  value of such Aircraft as
set forth in SECTION 2.17(a) of the Disclosure  Letter. In such event, Seller
shall be entitled to receive and retain all  insurance proceeds, if any,
received by Seller or the Company in respect of  the destruction of such
Aircraft, and at Closing the Company shall assign  to Seller any rights the
Company has to receive any insurance proceeds or  payments with respect to
such destruction. Except as provided in SECTION  6.06(c), the Closing shall
occur pursuant to SECTION 1.03 hereof without  delay.   (b) In the event of
the damage of any Aircraft or Related Equipment  prior to Closing that does
not constitute a total destruction or loss of  the Aircraft in accordance
SECTION 6.06(a) or the damage or destruction of  any other asset or property
of the Company prior to Closing, the Company  shall promptly notify Purchaser
of such damage or destruction, and Seller  shall, at Seller\'s option, either
(i) repair such Aircraft or Related  Equipment or other asset or property and
restore it to the condition it was  in immediately prior to such damage or
destruction at Seller\'s sole cost  and expense or (ii) reduce the Purchase
Price by an amount equal to the net  insurance proceeds, if any, received by
Seller or the Company on or prior  to the Closing in respect of such damage
or destruction, plus the amount of  any deductible or self retention amount
applicable to such damage or  destruction and at the Closing assign to the
Company any rights Seller has  to receive any additional insurance proceeds
or payments with respect to  such damage or destruction. In the event that
Seller elects to repair such  damage or destruction, Seller shall be entitled
to receive and retain all  insurance proceeds, if any, received by Seller or
the Company in respect of  such damage or destruction, and at the Closing the
Company shall assign to  Seller any rights the Company has to receive any
additional insurance  proceeds or payments with respect to such damage or
destruction. Except as  provided in SECTION 6.06(c), the Closing shall,
subject to the conditions  set forth in ARTICLE V hereof, occur pursuant to
SECTION 1.03 hereof  without delay.   (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of
SECTION 6.06(a) or SECTION  6.06(b), Seller and Purchaser agree that if the
damage or destruction  covered by those provisions is such that Seller or
Purchaser in good faith  reasonably expects the amount thereof to be in
excess of $40,000,000, then  Purchaser may terminate this Agreement. Unless
terminated as hereinbefore  provided in this SECTION 6.06(c), the Stock
Purchase shall otherwise be  consummated, subject to the conditions set forth
in ARTICLE V hereof, as  though such destruction or damage had not
occurred.    50   (d) If, prior to the Closing Date, all or any
significant portion (as  defined in this SECTION 6.06(d)) of the Company
Properties is taken by  eminent domain (or is the subject of a pending taking
which has not yet  been consummated), Seller shall notify Purchaser of such
fact promptly  after obtaining Knowledge thereof, and Purchaser shall have
the right to  terminate this Agreement by giving notice to Seller not later
than ten (10)  days after the giving of Seller\'s notice. For the purposes
hereof, a  "significant portion" of the Company Properties shall mean such a
portion  of the Company Properties as shall be necessary, as reasonably
determined  by Purchaser, for the operation of the Business in the ordinary
course,  without causing a Company Material Adverse Effect. If Purchaser does
not  elect to terminate this Agreement as aforesaid, or if an
"insignificant  portion" (i.e., anything other than a significant portion) of
the Company  Properties is taken by eminent domain (or becomes the subject of
a pending  taking), there shall be no abatement of the Purchase Price, and
Seller  shall assign to the Company (without recourse) at the Closing the
rights of  Seller to the awards, if any, for the taking, and the Company
shall be  entitled to receive and keep all awards for the taking of the
Company  Properties or such portion thereof.   ARTICLE VII   SURVIVAL AND
INDEMNIFICATION   SECTION 7.01 Survival Periods. Subject to the immediately
following sentence, all representations and warranties of Purchaser and
Seller contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the date
that is twelve (12) months after the Closing Date and all representations and
warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement, to the extent applicable or
related to the Fixed Wing Business (as defined in SECTION 8.10(g)), shall
survive the Closing until the date that is twenty-four (24) months after the
Closing Date, except that (i) the representations and warranties of Seller
contained in SECTION 2.01, SECTION 2.04, SECTION 2.11, SECTION 2.12, and
SECTION 2.13 and the representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in
SECTION 3.01 and SECTION 3.02 shall each survive the Closing until ninety
(90) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
and (ii) the representations and warranties of Seller contained in SECTION
2.03 and SECTION 2.24 and the representations and warranties of Purchaser
contained in SECTION 3.07 shall survive indefinitely, with respect to the
particular matter that is the subject matter of each thereof (each of the
foregoing periods as to the representations and warranties to which they
apply, the "Survival Period"); provided, however, that any obligations
to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any
Purchaser Damages or Seller Damages, as the case may be, as to which the
Person to be indemnified shall have given notice (stating in reasonable
detail the basis of the claim for indemnification) to the indemnifying party
in accordance with SECTION 7.02, SECTION 7.03 or SECTION 7.04 of this
Agreement before the termination of the applicable Survival Period. The
representations and warranties of the Company shall terminate as of the
Closing, and Seller and the Company each hereby releases the other from all
claims arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based
on indemnification.    51   SECTION 7.02 Seller\'s Agreement to
Indemnify.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement,  from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold
harmless  Purchaser and its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,
controlling  persons, agents and representatives and their successors and
assigns  (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnitees") from and against all
liability,  demands, claims, actions or causes of action, assessments,
losses, damages,  costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees
and expenses)  (collectively, "Purchaser Damages") asserted against or
incurred by any  Purchaser Indemnitee as a result of or arising out of (i) a
breach of any  representation or warranty contained in ARTICLE II of this
Agreement (other  than a representation or warranty contained in SECTION
2.12(r) the  indemnification for which shall be solely and exclusively
governed by  SECTION 4.08) (each of which, for purposes of this SECTION
7.02(a), shall  be deemed to have been made as of the date hereof and as of
the Closing  Date, except for those which expressly relate to an earlier
date, each of  which shall be deemed to have been made as of such earlier
date) or (ii)  any breach of any of the covenants and agreements of Seller or
the Company  contained in this Agreement, including any agreement of Seller
to indemnify  Purchaser with respect to specific matters contained elsewhere
in this  Agreement (other than a covenant or agreement relating to Taxes and
set  forth in SECTION 4.08 the indemnification for which shall be solely
and  exclusively governed by SECTION 4.08).   (b) Seller\'s obligation to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees for  Purchaser Damages under SECTION
7.02(a) of this Agreement is subject to the  following limitations:   (i)
Seller shall have no obligation under SECTION 7.02(a) to  indemnify any
Purchaser Indemnitee for any Purchaser Damages resulting  from or arising out
of any Terminating Seller Breach occurring after  the date hereof but prior
to the Closing of which any party hereto has  provided written notice to the
other parties in accordance with  SECTION 4.14 prior to the Closing.   (ii)
No indemnification shall be made by Seller under SECTION  7.02(a) unless the
aggregate amount of all Purchaser Damages exceeds  $1,000,000 (the
"Deductible Amount") and, in such event,  indemnification shall be made by
Seller only to the extent that the  aggregate amount of Purchaser Damages
exceeds the Deductible Amount;  provided, however, that, the limitations of
this SECTION 7.02(b)(ii)  shall not apply with respect to any Purchaser
Damages arising out of  or resulting from breaches of any representation or
warranty contained  in SECTION 2.03, SECTION 2.12, SECTION 2.15(a) or SECTION
2.24, and,  subject to SECTION 7.02(b)(iii), SECTION 7.02(b)(iv) and
SECTION  7.02(b)(v), indemnification shall be made by Seller for all
Purchaser  Damages arising out of or resulting from the breach of any such 
representation or warranty;    52   (iii) Subject to SECTION 7.02(b)(iv)
and SECTION 7.02(b)(v), in  no event shall Seller\'s aggregate obligation to
indemnify the  Purchaser Indemnitees for Fixed Wing Claims (as defined in
SECTION  8.10(h)) of which Seller first receives notice from the applicable 
Purchaser Indemnitees after the first anniversary of the Closing Date  but on
or before the second anniversary of the Closing Date exceed  $11,000,000, or
in the case of Fixed Wing Claims arising out of or  resulting from breaches
of any representation or warranty contained in  SECTION 2.03, SECTION 2.11,
SECTION 2.12, SECTION 2.13, SECTION  2.15(a) or SECTION 2.24 or any of the
covenants or agreements of  Seller or the Company contained in SECTION 4.07,
the Purchase Price,  except in the event that such obligation to indemnify
arises from the  fraudulent act or omission of Seller;   (iv) In no event
shall Seller\'s aggregate obligation to indemnify  the Purchaser Indemnitees
for Purchaser Damages under SECTION 7.02(a)  exceed $40,000,000, or in the
case of Purchaser Damages arising out of  or resulting from breaches of any
representation or warranty contained  in SECTION 2.03, SECTION 2.11, SECTION
2.12, SECTION 2.13, SECTION  2.15(a) or SECTION 2.24 or any of the covenants
or agreements of  Seller or the Company contained in SECTION 4.07, the
Purchase Price,  except in the event that such obligation to indemnify arises
from the  fraudulent act or omission of Seller;   (v) In no event shall
Seller\'s aggregate obligation to indemnify  the Purchaser Indemnitees under
SECTION 7.02(a) exceed the Purchase  Price, except in the event that such
obligation to indemnify arises  from the fraudulent act or omission of
Seller;   (vi) The amount of any Purchaser Damages shall be reduced by any 
amount actually received by a Purchaser Indemnitee with respect to  such
Purchaser Damages under any insurance coverage or from any other  party
alleged to be responsible for such Purchaser Damages. If a  Purchaser
Indemnitee receives an amount under insurance coverage or  from any such
other party with respect to Purchaser Damages at any  time subsequent to any
indemnification provided by Seller under this  SECTION 7.02, then such
Purchaser Indemnitee shall promptly (but in no  event more than ten (10)
Business Days after receipt of such amount)  reimburse Seller for amounts
paid by Seller to the Purchaser  Indemnitee in connection with providing such
indemnification up to  such amount received by the Purchaser Indemnitee;
and   (vii) Seller shall be obligated to indemnify the Purchaser 
Indemnitees under SECTION 7.02(a) only for those claims giving rise to 
Purchaser Damages with respect to which the Purchaser Indemnitees have  given
Seller written notice prior to the end of the applicable  Survival Period.
Any written notice delivered by a Purchaser  Indemnitee to Seller with
respect to Purchaser Damages shall set forth  with as much specificity as is
reasonably practicable the basis of the  claim for Purchaser Damages, whether
the Purchaser Indemnitee believes  the claim to be a Fixed-Wing Claim and, to
the extent reasonably  practicable, a reasonable estimate of the amount of
such claim.  Subject to the procedures with respect to Claims under SECTION
7.04  hereof, if such written notice (or an amended notice) states the   
53   amount of Purchaser Damages claimed and Seller notifies the Purchaser 
Indemnitee that Seller does not dispute the claim described in such  notice
or fails to notify the Purchaser Indemnitee within twenty (20)  Business Days
after delivery of such notice by the Purchaser  Indemnitee whether Seller
disputes the claim described in such notice,  Purchaser Damages in the amount
specified in such notice will be  deemed admitted by Seller, and Seller will
pay the amount of such  Purchaser Damages to the Purchaser Indemnitee. If a
written notice  does not state the amount of Purchaser Damages claimed, such
omission  will not preclude the Purchaser Indemnitee from recovering from
Seller  the amount of Purchaser Damages with respect to the claim described
in  such notice upon final determination thereof.   (c) Seller will pay the
amount of any Purchaser Damages to the  applicable Purchaser Indemnitee
within five (5) Business Days following the  determination of Seller\'s
liability for and the amount of Purchaser Damages  (whether such
determination is made pursuant to the procedures set forth in  this ARTICLE
VII, by agreement between the Purchaser Indemnitee and Seller  or by final
adjudication in accordance with the terms of this Agreement).   SECTION 7.03
Purchaser\'s Agreement to Indemnify.   (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement,  from and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless  Seller and Seller\'s directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling  persons, agents and
representatives and their successors and assigns  (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnitees") from and against all liability,  demands, claims, actions or
causes of action, assessments, losses, damages,  costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses)  (collectively, "Seller
Damages") asserted against or incurred by any Seller  Indemnitee as a result
of or arising out of (i) a breach of any  representation or warranty
contained in ARTICLE III of this Agreement (each  of which, for purposes of
this SECTION 7.03(a), shall be deemed to have  been made as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing Date, except for  those which expressly relate
to an earlier date, each of which shall be  deemed to have been made as of
such earlier date) or (ii) any breach of any  of the covenants or agreements
of Purchaser contained in this Agreement,  including any agreement of
Purchaser to indemnify Seller with respect to  specific matters contained
elsewhere in this Agreement (other than a  covenant or agreement relating to
Taxes and set forth in SECTION 4.08 the  indemnification for which shall be
solely and exclusively governed by  SECTION 4.08)).   (b) Purchaser\'s
obligation to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees under  SECTION 7.03(a) of this
Agreement is subject to the following limitations:   (i) Purchaser shall
have no obligation under SECTION 7.03(a) to  indemnify any Seller Indemnitee
for any Seller Damages resulting from  or arising out of any Terminating
Purchaser Breach occurring after the  date hereof but prior to the Closing of
which any party hereto has  provided written notice to the other parties in
accordance with  SECTION 4.14 prior to the Closing.    54   (ii) The
amount of any Seller Damages shall be reduced by any  amount actually
received by a Seller Indemnitee with respect to such  Seller Damages under
any insurance coverage or from any other party  alleged to be responsible for
such Seller Damages. If a Seller  Indemnitee receives any amount under
insurance coverage or from any  such other party with respect to Seller
Damages at any time subsequent  to any indemnification provided by Purchaser
under this SECTION 7.03,  then such Seller Indemnitee shall promptly (but in
no event more than  ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such amount)
reimburse  Purchaser for amounts paid by Purchaser to the Seller Indemnitee
in  connection with providing such indemnification up to such amount 
received by the Seller Indemnitee; and   (iii) Purchaser shall be obligated
to indemnify the Seller  Indemnitees under SECTION 7.03(a) only for those
claims giving rise to  Seller Damages with respect to which the Seller
Indemnitees have given  Purchaser written notice prior to the end of the
Survival Period (to  the extent the Survival Period is applicable to such
claim). Any  written notice delivered by a Seller Indemnitee to Purchaser
with  respect to Seller Damages shall set forth with as much specificity as 
is reasonably practicable the basis of the claim for Seller Damages  and, to
the extent reasonably practicable, a reasonable estimate of  the amount of
such claim. Subject to the procedures with respect to  Claims under SECTION
7.04 hereof, if such written notice (or an  amended notice) states the amount
of Seller Damages claimed and  Purchaser notifies the Seller Indemnitee that
Purchaser does not  dispute the claim described in such notice or fails to
notify the  Seller Indemnitee within twenty (20) Business Days after delivery
of  such notice by the Seller Indemnitee whether Purchaser disputes the 
claim described in such notice, Seller Damages in the amount specified  in
such notice will be deemed admitted by Purchaser, and Purchaser  will pay the
amount of such Seller Damages to the Seller Indemnitee.  If a written notice
does not state the amount of Seller Damages  claimed, such omission will not
preclude the Seller Indemnitee from  recovering from Purchaser the amount of
Seller Damages with respect to  the claim described in such notice upon final
determination thereof.   (c) Purchaser will pay the amount of any Seller
Damages to the  applicable Seller Indemnitee within five (5) Business Days
following the  determination of Purchaser\'s liability for and the amount of
Seller Damages  (whether such determination is made pursuant to the
procedures set forth in  this ARTICLE VII, by agreement between Purchaser and
the Seller Indemnitee  or by final adjudication in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement).   SECTION 7.04 Indemnification Procedures For Third
Party Claims. The obligations of Seller to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnitees under SECTION 7.02 of this Agreement with respect to Purchaser
Damages and the obligations of Purchaser to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees
under SECTION 7.03 of this Agreement with respect to Seller Damages, in
either case resulting from the assertion of liability by third parties (each,
as the case may be, a "Claim"), will be subject to the following terms and
conditions:    55   (a) Any party against whom any Claim is asserted will
give the  indemnifying party written notice of any such Claim promptly after
learning  of such Claim, and the indemnifying party may, at its option,
undertake the  defense of such Claim by representatives of its own choosing.
Failure to  give prompt notice of a Claim under this Agreement shall not
affect the  indemnifying party\'s obligations under this ARTICLE VII, except
to the  extent the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such
failure to  give prompt notice. If the indemnifying party, within thirty (30)
days  after notice of any such Claim, or such shorter period as is
reasonably  required, fails to assume or diligently pursue the defense of
such Claim,  the Purchaser Indemnitee or the Seller Indemnitee, as the case
may be,  against whom such Claim has been made will (upon further notice to
the  indemnifying party) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise
or  settlement of such Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk, and
at  the expense, of the indemnifying party, subject to the right of the 
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such Claim at any time prior to 
settlement, compromise or final determination of such Claim. If the 
indemnifying party assumes such defense, the Purchaser Indemnitee or the 
Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, shall have the right to participate 
in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense (which 
expense shall not constitute a Purchaser Damage or Seller Damage, as 
applicable, unless the Purchaser Indemnitee or the Seller Indemnitee, as  the
case may be, reasonably determines that the indemnifying party is not 
adequately representing or, because of a conflict of interest, may not 
adequately represent, any interests of the Purchaser Indemnitee or the 
Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, and only to the extent that such 
expenses are reasonable), separate from the counsel employed by the 
Purchaser Indemnitee or the Seller Indemnitee, as the case may be, it being 
understood, however, that the indemnifying party shall control such  defense.
The indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses  of counsel
employed by the Purchaser Indemnitee or the Seller Indemnitee,  as the case
may be, for any period during which the indemnifying party has  not assumed
the defense thereof; provided, however, that the indemnifying  party shall
not be required to pay for more than one such counsel for all  indemnified
parties in connection with any Claim.   (b) Anything in this SECTION 7.04 to
the contrary notwithstanding, the  indemnifying party shall not enter into
any settlement or compromise of any  action, suit or proceeding or consent to
the entry of any judgment (i) that  does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the delivery by the  claimant or plaintiff to the Seller Indemnitee
or the Purchaser Indemnitee,  as the case may be, of a written release from
all liability in respect of  such action, suit or proceeding or (ii) for
other than monetary damages to  be borne by the indemnifying party, without
the prior written consent of  the Seller Indemnitee or the Purchaser
Indemnitee, as the case may be,  which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.   (c) The indemnifying party and the Seller Indemnitee or
Purchaser  Indemnitee, as applicable, shall provide each other such
cooperation as may  be reasonably requested and at the expense of the
indemnifying party in all  aspects of any investigation, defense, pretrial
activities, trial,  compromise, settlement or discharge of any claim in
respect of which  indemnity is sought under this ARTICLE VII, including, but
not limited to,  by providing the indemnifying party with reasonable access
to employees and  officers (including as witnesses) and other
information.    56   SECTION 7.05 No Setoff. Neither Purchaser nor Seller
shall have any right to setoff any Purchaser Damages or Seller Damages,
respectively, against any payments to be made by either of them under this
Agreement.   SECTION 7.06 No Duplication. Any liability for indemnification
under this Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by
reason of the state of facts (i) giving rise to such liability constituting a
breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or
(ii) taken into account in determining any adjustment to the Purchase Price
under SECTION 1.09(b).   SECTION 7.07 Qualifications for Materiality.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
indemnification obligations of Seller and Purchaser under this ARTICLE VII in
connection with a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained in this Agreement shall be determined taking into account
any qualifications, provisions or exceptions for "material", "materiality,"
"in all material respects" (or correlative meanings) or "Company Material
Adverse Effect" set forth in such representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement, but for purposes of determining any Seller Damages or Purchaser
Damages, as the case may be, to be indemnified, such representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements shall be deemed to have been made
or given for the purposes of this ARTICLE VII as though there were no such
qualification, provision or exception. The parties acknowledge that the
failure to disclose a matter in the Disclosure Letter or Purchaser Disclosure
Letter due to the materiality thresholds set forth in any such
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement shall not give rise to
Purchaser Damages or Seller Damages, as the case may be.   SECTION 7.08 Sole
Remedy.   (a) After the Closing, the parties agree that the sole and
exclusive  remedy of any party to this Agreement or their respective
Affiliates with  respect to this Agreement, the events giving rise to this
Agreement and the  transactions provided for in this Agreement, shall be
limited to the  adjustment and indemnification provisions set forth in this
ARTICLE VII and  elsewhere in this Agreement, and in furtherance of the
foregoing, each of  the parties, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
waives and releases  the other party to this Agreement (and such other
party\'s Affiliates) from,  to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, any and all rights,  claims and causes of action it or its Affiliates
may have against the other  party to this Agreement, except as provided by
this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement
will prevent any  party from bringing an action based upon allegations of
