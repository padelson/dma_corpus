CONVERSION OF SECURITIES   Section 3.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. As of
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any holder of any shares of Discount Common Stock, or capital stock
of Merger Sub and subject to Section 3.2 and subject to the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement:   (a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued
and outstanding share of the  capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted
into and become one  validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of  the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Cancellation of Treasury
Stock. All shares of Discount Common Stock  that are owned directly or
indirectly by Discount as treasury stock, if  any, shall be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no  payment shall be made with respect
thereto.   (c) Conversion of Discount Common Stock. Each issued and
outstanding share  of Discount Common Stock shall be converted into the right
to receive  the Per Share Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional  shares of New Holding Common Stock to be issued or paid in 
consideration therefor. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of 
Discount Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall  automatically
be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and  each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares shall cease  to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive  with respect to each share
represented thereby the Per Share Merger  Consideration and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of New Holding  Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon the  surrender of such certificate in accordance
with Section 3.3, without  interest.   8    (d) Withholding Taxes. The
right of any stockholder of Discount to receive  the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be subject to and reduced by  the amount of any required
Tax withholding obligation from the Per  Share Cash Portion of the Per Share
Merger Consideration.   (e) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of New
Holding Common Stock  will be issued in the Merger but, in lieu thereof, each
holder of  Discount Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of  a share of New Holding Common Stock will be entitled to receive
from  the Surviving Corporation, which amount shall be paid by the Exchange 
Agent as provided for in Section 3.3 an amount in cash (rounded to the 
nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) the fraction multiplied  by
(ii) $29.11.   (f) Stock Options.   (i) At or immediately before the
Effective Time, each outstanding  option to purchase shares of Discount
Common Stock, granted under any  stock option or compensation plan or
arrangement of Discount, and with  a per share exercise price or strike price
of less than $15.00 per  share (an "In-the-Money Option") shall be cancelled
and converted into  the right to receive at the Effective Time or as soon as
practicable  thereafter in consideration for such cancellation an amount in
cash  equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of the Discount
Common  Stock previously subject to such In-the-Money Option and (2) the 
difference between $15.00 and the exercise price per share of Discount 
Common Stock previously subject to such In-the-Money Option. At the 
Effective Time, such In-the-Money Options shall no longer be  outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and  converted into the right to
receive the cash payment specified in this  Section 3.1(f)(i), and each
holder of an In-the-Money Option shall  cease to have any rights with respect
to the In-the-Money Option other  than the right to receive with respect
thereto the cash payment  specified in this Section 3.1(f)(i) upon the
surrender of the In-the-  Money Option in accordance with Section 3.3,
without interest. The  surrender of the In-the-Money Option shall be deemed a
release of any  and all rights the holder had or may have had in respect of
such  option. In addition, the right of any holder of In-the-Money Options
to  receive the cash payment specified in this Section 3.1(f)(i) shall be 
subject to and reduced by the amount of any required tax withholding 
obligation.   (ii) Each issued and outstanding stock option to purchase
shares  of Discount Common Stock granted under any stock option or
compensation  plan or arrangement of Discount that is not an outstanding In-
the-Money  Option (each, a "Fully Converted Option", and together with the
In-the-  Money Options, the "Outstanding Discount Options"), whether or not
then  exercisable, shall at the Effective Time be converted into an option
to  acquire, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were 
applicable under such Fully Converted Option immediately prior to the 
Effective Time (but reflecting the acceleration of vesting occasioned  by the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)  and which
option shall be considered issued under and subject to the  terms of the 2001
Acquiror Executive Stock Option Plan (the "Acquiror  Plan"), the number of
shares of New Holding Common Stock determined by  multiplying the number of
shares of Discount Common Stock that were  purchasable immediately prior to
the Effective Time upon the exercise  of such Fully Converted Option by
0.5154 (the "Option Exchange Ratio")  (rounded as hereinafter provided) at a
price per share (rounded up to  the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the
exercise price per share of  Discount Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time under  such Fully Converted Option divided by (B) the Option
Exchange Ratio;  provided, however, that with respect to a Fully Converted
Option with  the same exercise price and option term, the number of shares of
New  Holding Common Stock to be represented by the Fully Converted Option 
shall be computed on an aggregate basis so as to create options for  whole
shares of New Holding Common Stock with any then remaining  fractional share
rounded up the nearest whole share. As soon as  practicable after the
Effective Time, New Holding shall deliver to each  holder of a Fully
Converted Option a stock option agreement or  certificate issued under the
Acquiror Plan as a replacement for the  stock option certificate previously
provided to such holder by Discount  and evidencing such Fully Converted
Option and setting forth such  holder\'s rights pursuant thereto, including
the number of shares of New   9    Holding Common Stock purchasable under
the converted stock option and  replacement option agreement or certificate
and the corresponding  exercise price thereunder. In addition, New Holding
shall take all  corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number  of shares of New Holding Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of a  Fully Converted Option. As soon as practicable after the
Effective  Time, New Holding shall file a registration statement on Form S-3
or  Form S-8, as the case may be (or any successor or appropriate forms), 
or another appropriate form, with respect to the shares of New Holding 
Common Stock subject to such Fully Converted Options and shall use its 
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such  registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the  current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for  so long as such Fully
Converted Options, as herein converted, remain  outstanding.   For example,
assume an out of the money option for 10,500 shares of  Discount Common Stock
with an exercise price of $20.00. At the  Effective Time, the out of the
money option shall be converted so as to  thereafter constitute an option to
acquire 5,412 shares of New Holding  Common Stock (10,500 X 0.5154) (rounded
up) at a price per share equal  to $38.80 ($20.00 / 0.5154).   (iii) As
soon as practicable following the date of this  Agreement, Holding, Merger
Sub and New Holding (or, if appropriate, any  committee administering any
stock option or compensation plan or  arrangement) shall take such additional
actions, if any, as may  reasonably be required or necessary to cause each
Fully Converted  Option to be converted at the Effective Time by virtue of
the Merger  and continued as an option of New Holding under the corresponding
New  Holding option plans. On or prior to the Effective Date, Discount
shall  take such additional action, if any, as may be reasonably required
or  necessary to cause the stock option or compensation plans or 
arrangements of Discount providing for the granting of stock options  with
respect to stock of Discount ("Discount Option Plans") to  terminate
immediately following the Effective Time and for the  provisions in any other
plan, program or arrangement providing for the  issuance or grant by Discount
of any interest in respect of the capital  stock of Discount to be terminated
immediately following the Effective  Time. The holders of Outstanding
Discount Options shall be entitled to  enforce this Section 3.1(f) against
the Surviving Corporation.   (g) Adjustments to Per Share Merger
Consideration. If, subject to Section  6.1, during the period between the
date of this Agreement and the  Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of Discount Common  Stock or New Holding Common Stock shall occur
(other than the change  contemplated by the Reincorporation), including by
reason of any  reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination,  exchange or readjustment, or stock dividend with a record date
during  such period, but excluding any change resulting from the issuance
of  shares upon exercise of options, warrants or other rights to acquire 
Discount Common Stock outstanding on the date of this Agreement and  listed
in the Discount Disclosure Schedule, the Per Share Merger  Consideration
(including both the Per Share Cash Portion of the Per  Share Merger
Consideration and the Per Share Stock Portion of the Per  Share Merger
Consideration) and the Option Merger Consideration  applicable to each
Outstanding Discount Option shall be appropriately  adjusted.   Section 3.2
Stockholder Approval, Proxy Statement/Prospectus.   (a) Discount Meeting.
Discount, acting through its Board of Directors,  shall in accordance with
applicable law and its Charter Documents:   (i) as soon as practicable, duly
call, give notice of, convene and  hold a special meeting of its stockholders
for the purpose of  considering and taking action upon this Agreement, the
Plan of Merger  and the Merger (the "Discount Meeting");   (ii) subject to
its fiduciary duties under applicable laws and  subject to Section 7.1,
recommend that its stockholders vote in favor  of the approval and adoption
of this Agreement, the Plan of Merger, the  Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Discount  Recommendation") and   10    include
in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus with respect to the Discount  Meeting, the
Discount Recommendation; and   (iii) use its reasonable best efforts (A) to
obtain and furnish  the information required to be included by it in the
Proxy  Statement/Prospectus, (B) to file the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
with  the SEC as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
in  accordance with Section 7.2, (C) to amend or supplement the Proxy 
Statement/Prospectus from time to time as necessary to assure that it  does
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to  state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made  therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made,  not misleading,
subject to the approval of Holding, which approval  Holding shall not
unreasonably withhold, (D) after consultation with  Holding, ASCI and Merger
Sub, to respond as promptly as is reasonably  practicable to any comments
made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy  Statement/Prospectus, any
preliminary version thereof or any amendments  or supplements thereto, (E) to
cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and  any amendments or supplements
thereto to be mailed to its stockholders  at the earliest practicable time,
and (F) subject to the fiduciary  duties of its Board of Directors under
applicable laws and subject to  Section 7.1, to obtain the necessary approval
of the Merger by its  stockholders.   (b) No Amendment. After the adoption
of this Agreement by the stockholders  of Discount, without the affirmative
vote of the holders of shares of  Discount Common Stock representing a
majority of the votes that may be  cast by the holders of all then
outstanding shares of Discount Common  Stock, Discount will not (i) enter
into any amendment to this Agreement  that would alter or change any of the
terms and conditions of this  Agreement if such alteration or change would
materially adversely  affect the holders of shares of Discount Common Stock,
or (ii) waive  any condition set forth in Section 8.1 or 8.3 if such waiver
would  materially adversely affect the holders of shares of Discount Common 
Stock.   (c) New Holding\'s Consent; Approval of Reincorporation. New
Holding, as the  sole stockholder of Merger Sub, hereby consents to the
adoption of this  Agreement by Merger Sub and agrees that such consent shall
be treated  for all purposes as a vote duly adopted at a meeting of the 
stockholders of Merger Sub held for this purpose. The directors and the 
stockholder of New Holding and the directors of Holding have each duly 
adopted, approved and authorized the Reincorporation. The Principal  Holding
Stockholders have entered into a binding and fully enforceable  voting
agreement pursuant to which each Principal Holding Stockholder  agrees to
vote in favor of adopting, approving and authorizing the  Reincorporation and
Discount shall be a third party beneficiary of that  voting agreement. Prior
to the Discount Meeting, Holding shall in  accordance with applicable law and
its Charter Documents duly call,  give notice of, convene and hold a special
meeting of its stockholders  for the purpose of considering and taking action
upon the  Reincorporation.   Section 3.3 Exchanging Certificates and In-
the-Money Options for Payment of Merger Consideration and Option Merger
Consideration. The procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of Discount
Common Stock and In-the-Money Options for Merger Consideration and Option
Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger are as follows:   (a) Exchange
Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, New Holding and Holding  shall designate
a United States bank or trust company, which shall be  US Stock Transfer and
Trust, to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange  Agent") for the payment of
Merger Consideration and Option Merger  Consideration upon surrender of
certificates representing Discount  Common Stock and certificates or
agreements representing In-the-Money  Options, and for no other purpose. At
or immediately following the  Effective Time, (i) New Holding shall provide
to the Exchange Agent the  shares of New Holding Common Stock to be issued as
the Stock  Consideration and (ii) New Holding and ASCI shall cause the
Surviving  Corporation to provide to the Exchange Agent from funds
contributed to  or otherwise provided to the Surviving Corporation by ASCI
cash in  immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the
Cash  Consideration and the Option Merger Consideration (such cash and
stock   11    being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The
monies in  the Exchange Fund may, as directed by the Surviving Corporation
(so  long as such directions do not impair the rights of holders of shares 
of Discount Common Stock to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration 
promptly upon the surrender of their shares in accordance with this 
Agreement or the rights of holders of In-the-Money Options to receive  the
Option Merger Consideration promptly upon surrender of their  options in
accordance with this Agreement), be invested by the Exchange  Agent in direct
obligations of the United States of America,  obligations for which the full
faith and credit of the United States of  America is pledged to provide for
the payment of principal and  interest, commercial paper rated of the highest
quality by Moody\'s  Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s
Corporation, or  certificates of deposit issued by a commercial bank having
at least  $1,000,000,000 in assets. Deposit of funds with the Exchange
Agent  shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation of its obligations to
make  payments in respect of the shares of Discount Common Stock or in 
respect of In-the-Money Options.   (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after
the Effective Time, New Holding  shall irrevocably instruct the Exchange
Agent and the Exchange Agent  shall mail and/or make available to each holder
of record of a  certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective  Time represented outstanding shares of Discount Common Stock
(the  "Certificates") whose shares of Discount Common Stock were converted 
pursuant to Section 3.1 into the right to receive Per Share Merger 
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that  delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the  Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the  Exchange Agent, and
shall be in such form and have such other  provisions as New Holding and
Discount may reasonably specify) and (ii)  instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in  exchange for Per Share Merger
Consideration. As promptly as practicable  after surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent  or to such other agent or agents as
may be appointed by New Holding,  together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of  such Certificate shall be paid in exchange
therefor, subject to any  required withholding of Taxes, the amount of cash
and the shares of New  Holding Common Stock that such holder is entitled to
receive as Per  Share Merger Consideration plus any cash in lieu of
fractional shares  that such holder is entitled to receive with respect to
the shares of  Discount Common Stock theretofore represented by such
Certificate, and  the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be
cancelled. In the  event of a transfer of ownership of Discount Common Stock
which is not  registered in the transfer records of Discount, payment may be
made to  a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so 
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly  endorsed,
with signature guaranteed, or otherwise be in proper form for  transfer and
the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer  or other taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than  the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the  satisfaction of New Holding
that such tax has been paid or is not  applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.3, each  Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to  represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the certificate  the shares of New Holding Common Stock and
the amount of cash, without  interest, that the holder thereof is entitled to
receive as Per Share  Merger Consideration (together with any cash in lieu of
fractional  shares) with respect to the shares of Discount Common Stock
theretofore  represented by such Certificate, subject to any required
withholding of  Taxes from the Per Share Cash Portion of the Per Share
Merger  Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the
cash  payable upon surrender of any Certificate. Promptly after the
Effective  Time, New Holding shall irrevocably instruct the Exchange Agent
and the  Exchange Agent shall take similar actions to address payment of
cash  with respect to In-the-Money Options.   (c) No Further Ownership
Rights in Discount Common Stock. Delivery of the  Merger Consideration and
Option Merger Consideration in accordance with  the terms of this Article 3
upon conversion of any shares of Discount  Common Stock and any In-the-Money
Options in the Merger, and the  assumption by New Holding of any Fully
Converted Option, shall be  deemed to have satisfied in full all rights
pertaining to such shares  of Discount Common Stock or such Outstanding
Discount   12    Options, as the case may be, subject, however, to the
Surviving  Corporation\'s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other 
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may  have
been declared or made by Discount on such shares of Discount  Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement (to the  extent permitted under
Section 6.1) prior to the date hereof and which  remain unpaid at the
Effective Time, and from and after the Effective  Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock  transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Discount  Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time and no further exercises
of Outstanding Discount Options. If,  after the Effective Time, Certificates
or option agreements or  certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange  Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided  in this Section 3.3.   (d) Termination of
Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which  remains undistributed
to the stockholders and optionholders of Discount  for 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the  Surviving Corporation, upon demand
of the Surviving Corporation,  subject to compliance with any applicable
abandoned property, escheat  or similar law, and any stockholders or
optionholders of Discount who  have not previously complied with this Section
3.3 shall thereafter  look only to New Holding and the Surviving Corporation
for payment of  their claim for Merger Consideration or Option Merger
Consideration,  without interest; provided, however, that New Holding and the
Surviving  Corporation shall continue to be liable for any payments required
to be  made thereafter under Section 3.1 hereof.   (e) No Liability. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, none of ASCI,  New Holding, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent or any of  their Affiliates shall be liable
to any Person in respect of any cash  or stock from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant  to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. If any  Certificate or option agreement or
certificate has not been surrendered  prior to five years after the Effective
Time (or immediately prior to  such earlier date on which Merger
Consideration in respect of such  Certificate would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any  Governmental Entity), any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions  in respect of such Certificate and any such
rights in respect of such  option agreement or certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by  applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free  and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled  thereto.   (f) Withholding Rights. The Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to  deduct and withhold from the cash portion
of the consideration  otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of  Discount Common Stock or In-the-Money Options such
amounts as it is  required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such  payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign
tax  law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving 
Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of  this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of  Discount Common
Stock or In-the-Money Options in respect of which such  deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation.   (g) Lost Certificates
and Lost Option Agreements and Certificates. If any  Certificate or any
option agreement or certificate shall have been  lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact  by the Person claiming such
Certificate or such option agreement or  certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the satisfaction of any  applicable rules of the New York Stock
Exchange and, if required by the  Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such  reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct as indemnity  against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such  Certificate or such option agreement or certificate, the
Exchange Agent  will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate or  option agreement or certificate, as the case may be, the
Merger  Consideration or the Option Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect  thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   13    ARTICLE 4  
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF DISCOUNT   Discount represents and
warrants to Holding, New Holding, ASCI and Merger Sub that the statements
contained in this Article 4 are true and correct, except as set forth herein
or as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Discount to Holding
on or before the date of this Agreement (the "Discount Disclosure Schedule").
The Discount Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in paragraphs
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this Article
4 (and in the other Articles of this Agreement) and the disclosure in any
paragraph shall qualify other sections in this Article 4 (and in the other
Articles of this Agreement) to the extent that it is readily apparent from a
reading of such disclosure that it should also qualify or apply to such other
sections.   Section 4.1 Organization of Discount.   (a) Discount and each
of its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly  existing and in active status
or good standing under the laws of the  jurisdiction of its incorporation,
has all requisite corporate power to  own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as  now being conducted, and is duly qualified
to do business and is in  good standing as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction in which  the failure to be so qualified would have a Material
Adverse Effect.   (b) The Discount Disclosure Schedule lists each Discount
Subsidiary and its  jurisdiction of incorporation. All the outstanding shares
of capital  stock of each Discount Subsidiary have been validly issued and
are  fully paid and nonassessable and, except as set forth in the Discount 
Disclosure Schedule, are owned by Discount, by another Discount  Subsidiary
or by Discount and another Discount Subsidiary, free and  clear of all Liens

the Subsidiaries listed in the Discount Disclosure Schedule,  neither
Discount nor any of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly  owns any equity
or similar interest in, or any interest convertible  into or exchangeable or
exercisable for, any corporation, partnership,  joint venture or other

shall be validly issued, fully  paid and nonassessable. There are no bonds,
debentures, notes or other  indebtedness of Discount having the right to vote
(or convertible into  securities having the right to vote) on any  
14    matters on which stockholders of Discount may vote. There are no 
obligations, contingent or otherwise, of Discount or any of its  Subsidiaries
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of  Discount Common

capital contribution or otherwise)  in any such Subsidiary or any other
entity other than guarantees of  bank obligations of Subsidiaries entered
into in the ordinary course of  business. The Discount Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a true and  complete description of the changes in vesting of
Outstanding Discount  Options that would occur if the Merger were
consummated.   (b) Except as set forth in the Discount Disclosure Schedule
or as reserved  for future grants of options and warrants under the Discount
Option  Plans, there are no equity securities of any class of Discount or
any  of its Subsidiaries, or any security exchangeable or convertible into 
or exercisable for such equity securities, issued, reserved for  issuance or

obligating Discount or any of its  Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or
cause to be issued,  delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock or
other equity  interests of Discount or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating
Discount  or any of its Subsidiaries to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting
of,  otherwise modify or amend or enter into any such option, warrant, 
equity security, call, right, commitment or agreement. To the Knowledge  of
Discount, there are no voting trusts, proxies or other voting  agreements or
understandings with respect to the shares of capital  stock or other equity
interests of Discount or any Subsidiary.   Section 4.3 Authority; No
Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.   (a) Discount has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and  deliver this Agreement and,
subject only to the approval of the Merger  by Discount\'s stockholders under
the FBCA, to consummate the  transactions contemplated hereby. The execution
and delivery of this  Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby  by Discount have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action  on the part of Discount, subject only to the approval of
the Merger by  Discount\'s stockholders under the FBCA; the vote of
Discount\'s  stockholders required to approve the Merger is the affirmative
vote of  the holders of a majority of the shares of Discount Common Stock 
outstanding on the record date for the Discount Meeting ("Stockholder 
Approval"). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by  Discount
and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Discount,  enforceable
against Discount in accordance with its terms, subject to  bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium  and similar laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting  creditors\' rights and to
general equity principles (the "Bankruptcy and  Equity Exception").   (b)

Adverse Effect, Discount and/or its Subsidiaries have filed  all forms,

documents, including the exhibits thereto, required to  be filed by Discount
and/or its Subsidiaries with the SEC under the  Securities Act or the

under which they were made, not misleading. None  of Discount\'s Subsidiaries
is required to file any forms, reports or  other documents with the SEC.

respects with the  applicable published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect  thereto, were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applied on a 
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be  indicated
in the notes to such Discount Financial Statements, in the  Discount SEC
Reports, or, in the case of unaudited interim financial  statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly presented  the consolidated
financial position of Discount and its Subsidiaries as  of the dates and the
consolidated results of its operations and cash  flows for the periods
indicated, except that the Discount Unaudited  Financial Statements were or
are subject to normal and recurring year-  end adjustments, and do not
contain any of the footnotes required by  U.S. GAAP or by the requirements of
Form 10-Q. The unaudited balance  sheet of Discount as of May 29, 2001 is
referred to herein as the  "Discount Balance Sheet."   Section 4.5 No

recurring liabilities incurred since the date of the Discount Balance Sheet
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, Discount
and its Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities, either accrued, contingent

in accordance with GAAP), and whether due or to become due,
which individually or in the aggregate, have had or will have a Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 4.6 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except
as disclosed in the Discount SEC Reports that have been filed and are
publicly available prior to the date hereof or the Discount Disclosure
Schedule, since the date of the Discount Balance Sheet, Discount and its

in a manner consistent with recent past practice and, since such date, there

operations, business, prospects, assets or properties of Discount and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that has had, or will have, a Material
Adverse Effect; (ii) any damage, destruction or loss (whether or not covered
by insurance) with respect to Discount or any of its Subsidiaries that has
had, or will have, a Material Adverse Effect; (iii) any material change by
Discount in its accounting methods, principles or practices to which Holding
has not previously consented in writing; (iv) any revaluation by Discount of
any of its assets or liabilities that has had, or will have, a Material

Discount and  each of its Subsidiaries (i) have timely filed all material Tax
Returns  required to be filed by them prior to the date of this Agreement 
(taking into account extensions) and will timely file all such material  Tax

failure to so file is not, individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) have paid  or accrued, or
will pay or accrue, all material Taxes payable (whether  or not such Taxes
are set forth on the Tax Returns of Discount and its  Subsidiaries or are
otherwise then due) for all taxable periods or  partial periods ending on or

individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Discount and each  of its Subsidiaries have withheld or

Subsidiaries (other  than liens for Taxes that are not yet due or that are
being contested  in good faith by appropriate proceedings and other than
liens for Taxes  that are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably

the Discount Disclosure Schedule, (i) neither  Discount nor any Discount
Subsidiary is currently the beneficiary of  any extension of time within
which to file any material Tax Return,  (ii) neither Discount nor any
Discount Subsidiary has waived any  statute of limitations in respect of

threatened by any  governmental authority, (iv) neither Discount nor any
Discount  Subsidiary has received, before the date of this Agreement, a
notice of  deficiency or assessment of additional material Taxes which notice
or  assessment remains unresolved, and (v) all resolved material Tax 
assessments against Discount and any Discount Subsidiary have been paid  or
are reflected in the Discount Balance Sheet.   (c) (i) Neither Discount nor
any Discount Subsidiary has any liability for  the Taxes of any Person under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6  (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign   17    law), as a transferee or successor, by contract,
or otherwise other  than liability that is not, individually or in the
aggregate,  reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (ii)
Except as set forth on the Discount Disclosure Schedule, neither  Discount
nor any Discount Subsidiary is or ever has been a party  to or bound by any
Tax indemnity, Tax sharing or Tax allocation  agreement (whether written or
unwritten or arising under operation  of federal law as a result of being a
member of a group filing  consolidated or combined Tax Returns, under
operation of any state  or local laws as a result of being a member of a
combined,  consolidated or unitary group, or under comparable laws of any 
other foreign jurisdiction) which includes a party other than  Discount and
the Discount Subsidiaries, nor does Discount or any  Discount Subsidiary owe
any amount under any such agreement.   (d) Neither Discount nor any Discount
Subsidiary is a "consenting  corporation" within the meaning of Section
341(f) of the Code, and none  of the assets of Discount or the Subsidiaries
are subject to an  election under Section 341(f) of the Code.   (e) Except
as set forth on the Discount Disclosure Schedule, neither  Discount nor any
of its Subsidiaries has made any payments, is  obligated to make any
payments, or is a party to any agreement that  could obligate it to make any
payments that will be an "excess  parachute payment" under Section 280G of
the Code as a result of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Except as set forth on the  Discount Disclosure Schedule, neither Discount
nor any Discount  Subsidiary has made any payments, is obligated to make any

could  obligate it to make any payments that will be non-deductible under
Code  Section 162, 280G or 404.   (f) Discount has made available to
Holding and ASCI complete, current and  correct copies of the federal and

(a) Discount has provided to Holding a true and complete list of all owned 
stores and all other Discount Owned Real Property with a fair market  value
in excess of $100,000 with respect to any parcel (collectively,  "Discount

as set forth in the Discount Disclosure Schedule, each  of Discount and each
Subsidiary of Discount has good, valid, marketable  and insurable title in
fee simple to all of its respective Discount  Material Real Property and
good, valid, and marketable title to all of  its other assets as are material

as currently conducted  (collectively, "Discount Material Personal
Property"), in each case  free and clear of all Liens other than (i) Discount
Permitted Liens,  (ii) with respect to Discount Material Real Property,
imperfections in  title and Liens which individually or in the aggregate do
not or will  not have a Material Adverse Effect, or (iii) Liens set forth
or  described in the Discount Disclosure Schedule. Discount has permitted 
Holding and ASCI to have access to the real estate files and related 
documentation for the Discount Material Real Property and all other  Discount
Owned Real Property, which files, after taking into account,  as if part of
such files, the related documentation which has been  delivered to Holding or
its representatives by Discount, are complete,  current and correct in all
material respects except as set forth on the  Discount Disclosure
Schedule.   (b) Discount has provided to Holding a true and complete list of
all  Discount Leased Real Property under leases for stores or with an
annual  rent in excess of $25,000 (collectively, "Discount Material
Leases"),  all other Discount Leased Real Property and the location of all 
Discount Leased Real Property. With respect to each such Discount  Material
Lease and except as set forth on the Discount Disclosure  Schedule: (i) each
Discount Material Lease is the legal, valid, binding  and enforceable
obligation of Discount subject to the Bankruptcy and  Equity Exception, and
is in full force and effect; (ii) each Discount  Material Lease will continue
to be the legal, valid, binding, and  enforceable obligation of Discount and
will remain in full force and  effect immediately following the Closing
in   18    accordance with the terms thereof as in effect prior to the
Closing  (except to the extent that such Discount Material Lease is
properly  terminated following the Closing for a failure to secure a consent
that  may prove to have been required as a result of the change of control 
effectuated by virtue of the consummation of the transactions  contemplated
by this Agreement); (iii) neither Discount nor, to the  Knowledge of
Discount, any other party to the Discount Material Lease  is in breach or
default, and to the Knowledge of Discount no event has  occurred which, with
notice or lapse of time, would constitute a breach  or default or permit
termination, modification or acceleration  thereunder; (iv) Discount has not
assigned, transferred, conveyed,  mortgaged, deeded in trust or encumbered
any interest in the leasehold  or subleasehold; (v) Discount has delivered to
Holding true, correct  and complete copies of all Discount Material Leases,
including all  amendments thereto and such copies reflect any and all
provisions or  agreements with the respective landlord which would require
consents,  if any, as a result of the change of control effectuated by virtue
of  the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 
and (vi) each of Discount and its Subsidiaries has good, valid and 
marketable leasehold title to each of its respective Discount Leased  Real
Properties, free and clear of all Liens other than Discount  Permitted Liens;
except, in the case of clauses (i) through (vi), where  the same is not
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.  Discount has reviewed
the schedule (prepared by Holding\'s advisors) of  consents which may be
required to Discount Material Leases as a result  of the change of control
effectuated by virtue of the consummation of  the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and without any  independent investigation, represents
that, to its Knowledge, such  schedule of consents is true and accurate.  
(c) The Discount Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and accurate list 
of all of Discount\'s and its Subsidiaries material trademarks and  describes
all of the other material Discount Intellectual Property  Rights, including
information as to all registrations or other filings  related to such
trademarks and Discount Intellectual Property Rights.  The Discount
Intellectual Property Rights listed in the Discount  Disclosure Schedule are
all those material intellectual property rights  necessary for the conduct of
the business of Discount and the Discount  Subsidiaries as presently
conducted. Except as set forth in the  Discount Disclosure Schedule, neither
Discount nor any Discount  Subsidiary has any obligation to compensate any
Person for the use of  any material Discount Intellectual Property Rights nor
has Discount or  any Discount Subsidiary granted to any Person any license,
option or  other rights to use in any manner any of the material Discount 
Intellectual Property Rights, whether requiring the payment of  royalties or
not. The material Discount Intellectual Property Rights  will not cease to be
rights of Discount or any Discount Subsidiary or  be impaired by reason of
the performance of this Agreement or the  consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. No other Person  (i) has notified Discount or any
Discount Subsidiary that such Person  claims any ownership of or right to use
any material Discount  Intellectual Property Rights or (ii) is infringing
upon any Discount  Intellectual Property Rights except for such infringements
that are not  reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as
set  forth in the Discount Disclosure Schedule, Discount\'s and the
Discount  Subsidiaries\' use of the material Discount Intellectual Property
Rights  does not conflict with, infringe upon or otherwise violate the
valid  rights of any third party except for such conflicts or infringements 
that are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. No  written
notice has been received and not fully resolved and, no action  has been
instituted or, to the Knowledge of Discount, threatened  against Discount or
any Discount Subsidiary alleging that Discount\'s or  any Discount
Subsidiary\'s use of the material Discount Intellectual  Property Rights
infringes upon or otherwise violates any rights of a  third party.  
Section 4.9 Agreements, Contracts and Commitments. The Discount
Disclosure Schedule lists, as of the date of this Agreement, (i) all

credit agreements, lease obligations or similar instruments under which
Discount or its Subsidiaries have borrowed or may borrow at least $250,000,
(ii) all employment agreements, change-in-control arrangements or change-in-
control bonuses, retention agreements, severance agreements and non-
competition agreements (and with respect to this subparagraph (ii) only, also

contemplated by this Agreement or if the services of the counterparty to such
agreement were to be terminated immediately following the Closing based on
covered positions and compensation as of June 30, 2001), (iii) all agreements
with vendors and suppliers involving purchases in excess of $1,000,000
annually and (iv) all other contracts or other written agreements whether or
not made in the ordinary course of business which are material to the
business of Discount and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole and which, if
lost, would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
(collectively, all such contracts and agreements referenced in items (i)
through (iv) are referred to as the "Discount Material Contracts"). Neither
Discount nor any Subsidiary is in default, and no event has occurred which,
whether with or without notice, lapse of time or the happening or occurrence
of any other event, would constitute a default under any of the contracts or
agreements set forth in the Discount Disclosure Schedule, where such default
is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Discount
Material Contract that has not expired by its terms is in full force and
effect, and no party to any of the Discount Material Contracts will have the
right to terminate such contract as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Except as set forth on the Discount Disclosure Schedule,
none of the Discount Material Contracts is currently being renegotiated, and
Discount has no Knowledge that any Discount Material Contract will be the
subject of a voluntary or regulatory ordered renegotiation within 12 months
after the date of this Agreement.   Section 4.10 Litigation. Except as

available prior to the date hereof or as set forth on the Discount Disclosure
Schedule, there is no action, suit or proceeding, claim, arbitration or
investigation against Discount or any of its Subsidiaries pending or as to
which Discount or any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of
assertion, which, individually or in the aggregate, will or would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse
effect on the ability of Discount to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. There is no judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of
any Governmental Entity or arbitration outstanding against Discount or any of
its Subsidiaries which is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 4.11 Employee Benefit Plans.   (a) Discount has listed
in the Discount Disclosure Schedule all material  employee benefit plans (as
defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA")), a  general description of the type of bonus

group of corporations, (ii) a group of trades or  businesses (whether or not
incorporated) under common control with  Discount, or (iii) an affiliated
service group, all within the meaning  of Section 414 of the Code, which

20    (c) With respect to the Discount Employee Plans, individually and in
the  aggregate, no event has occurred and there exists no condition or set 
of circumstances, in connection with which Discount could be subject to  any
liability that is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse  Effect under
ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law.   (d) None of Discount, any
Subsidiary of Discount or any entity that is, or  at any time has been,
considered one employer with Discount under  Section 4001 of ERISA or Section
414 of the Code contributes or has  ever contributed or been obligated to
contribute to any "multiemployer  plan" within the meaning of Sections 3(37)
or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or to  any defined benefit pension plan subject to
Title IV of ERISA or to  Part 3 of Subpart B of Title I of ERISA.   (e)
With respect to the Discount Employee Plans, individually and in the 
aggregate, and except as set forth on the Discount Disclosure Schedule, 
there are no funded benefit obligations for which contributions have  not
been made or properly accrued and there are no unfunded benefit  obligations
which have not been accounted for by reserves, or otherwise  properly
footnoted, in either case in accordance with GAAP, on the  financial
statements of Discount, which obligations are reasonably  likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.   (f) Except as disclosed in Discount SEC Reports
filed prior to the date of  this Agreement, except as set forth on the
Discount Disclosure Schedule  and except as provided for in this Agreement,
neither Discount nor any  of its Subsidiaries is a party to any oral or

this Agreement, or by  the termination of employment following such
transaction, (ii)  agreement with any current or former officer or senior
management  employee of Discount, or with any other current or former
employee of  Discount, providing any term of employment or compensation
guarantee  which would continue after the Closing or otherwise preventing
the  termination at will of such officer or employee after the Closing, or 
(iii) agreement, arrangement or plan, including any stock option plan,  stock
appreciation right plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase  plan,
deferred compensation, retirement or similar plan, change of  control plan or
arrangement, retention plan or arrangement, or  severance plan or
arrangement, any of the benefits of which will be  increased, or the vesting
or funding of the benefits of which will be  accelerated, by the occurrence
of any of the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement or the value of
any of the benefits of which will be  calculated on the basis of any of the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, and with respect to any item
disclosed under this Section  4.11(f) the Discount Disclosure Schedule
includes, to the extent  determinable, the value of benefits vested,
increased or accelerated.   (g) Except as disclosed in the Discount
Disclosure Schedule, (i) there are  no pending or, to the Knowledge of
Discount, threatened claims,  actions, suits, termination proceedings, or

local statute, law or regulation or any judgment, decree or order of any
Governmental Entity with respect to the conduct of their respective business,
or the ownership or operation of their respective businesses, except for
failures to comply or violations which, individually or in the aggregate,
have not been fully resolved with no continuing material liability to
Discount and the Discount Subsidiaries or are not reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Discount and its Subsidiaries have in effect all
federal, state, local and foreign governmental approvals, authorizations,
certificates, filings, franchises, notices, permits, variances and rights  
21   ("Discount Approvals") necessary for them to own or lease and operate
their properties and assets and to carry on their respective businesses as

or failure to obtain such Discount Approval, which would individually or in
the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 4.13 Registration

None of the information supplied or to be supplied in writing by Discount
which is included in either the Registration Statement, the Blue Sky Filings,

Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Discount will promptly inform Holding, and
Discount shall cooperate so as to enable such amendment or supplement to be
promptly filed with the SEC and appropriate state securities administrators,
and disseminated to the stockholders of Discount, to the extent required by
applicable federal and state securities laws. All documents which Discount
files or is responsible for filing with the SEC and any regulatory agency in
connection with the Merger (including, without limitation, the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus) will comply as to form and, to the extent provided by
Discount, as to content, in each case in all material respects with the

its Subsidiaries been requested within the last three years to recognize or
bargain with any labor union or labor organization with respect to any

Discount and its Subsidiaries maintain, in coverages and amounts believed by

or present any material claim under any such policy or binder in due and
timely fashion. Except as set forth in the Discount Disclosure Schedule,
neither Discount nor any Discount Subsidiary has received notice of
cancellation or non-renewal of any such policy or binder.   22   
Section 4.16 Environmental Matters.   (a) Except as described in the
Discount Disclosure Schedule: (i) Discount  and the Discount Subsidiaries
have complied in all respects with, and  are currently in compliance in all
respects with all, and have no  liability under any, applicable Environmental
Laws, except for any  noncompliance or liability that would not reasonably be
expected to  result in a Material Adverse Effect; (ii) the properties
currently  owned, leased or operated by Discount and the Discount
Subsidiaries  (including soils, groundwater, surface water, buildings or
other  structures) are in compliance in all respects with all applicable 
Environmental Laws, and are not contaminated with any Hazardous  Substances
in a manner so as to create any liability for Discount and  the Discount
Subsidiaries, except for any noncompliance or  contamination that would not
reasonably be expected to result in a  Material Adverse Effect; (iii) the
properties formerly owned, leased or  operated by Discount or any of the
Discount Subsidiaries were in  compliance in all respects with all applicable
Environmental Laws, and  were not contaminated with Hazardous Substances
during the period of  ownership or operation by Discount or any of the
Discount Subsidiaries  in a manner so as to create any liability for Discount
and the Discount  Subsidiaries, except for any noncompliance or contamination
that would  not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect; (iv)  neither Discount nor any of the Discount Subsidiaries are or
are  alleged to be subject to any liability for any Hazardous Substance 
disposal or contamination on the property of any third party, except  for any
liability or contamination that would not reasonably be  expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect; (v) neither Discount  nor any of the Discount
Subsidiaries have released any Hazardous  Substance except in compliance in
all respects with applicable  Environmental Law and in a manner that would

Discount Subsidiaries may be in violation of, liable under or have 
obligations under any Environmental Law, except for any violation that  would
not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse  Effect. For
purposes of this Section 4.16, (A) a property will be  deemed to be

other liability under applicable  Environmental Laws, and (B) Discount and
its Subsidiaries shall include  (x) all partnerships, joint ventures and
other entities in which any of  them was at any time a partner, joint
venturer, member or participant  and (y) all predecessor or former entities,

of which have been  acquired or assumed by any of them or to which any of
them has  succeeded.   (b) The representations and warranties in this
Section 4.16 are intended to  be the only representations and warranties of
Discount relating to  environmental matters. No other representation or
warranty made by  Discount shall extend to or cover such matters, even though
it is, by  its terms, broad enough to do so.   Section 4.17 No Existing
Discussions. As of the date hereof, Discount has terminated all discussions
or negotiations with any third party with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
and each such third party has been instructed to return any Confidential
Information obtained from Discount (or to the extent permitted, has certified
the destruction thereof).   Section 4.18 Opinion of Financial Advisor.
Salomon Smith Barney Inc. ("Salomon Smith Barney"), the financial advisor to
Discount, has delivered to the Board of Directors of Discount an opinion
dated the date of approval by such Board of Directors of the terms hereof to
the effect that, as of such date and based upon the matters considered by
Salomon Smith Barney in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Per Share Merger Consideration is fair from a financial point
of view to the holders of Discount Common Stock and a copy of the
subsequently delivered confirming written opinion to such effect based on the
review of the executed copy of this Agreement, which is being addressed to
the Board of Directors of Discount   23   only, will be provided to
Holding promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the receipt thereof by Discount.   Section 4.19 Brokers. No broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other Person, other than Salomon

to any broker\'s, finder\'s, investment banker\'s, financial advisor\'s or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Discount. Discount has delivered to Holding a fully executed copy of its
engagement letter with Salomon Smith Barney, including all amendments thereto
through the date hereof, and such engagement letter (the "Salomon Smith
Barney Engagement Letter") remains in full force and effect as of the date
hereof.   Section 4.20 Anti-Takeover Laws; Stockholder Rights Agreement.
Discount has taken all actions necessary under Florida law such that no "fair
price", "business combination", "control share acquisition", or similar
statute will be applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. With respect to that certain Stockholder Rights Agreement between
Discount and ChaseMellon Shareholder Services, LLC (n/k/a Mellon Investor
Services LLC) dated as of November 21, 2000 (the "Stockholder Rights
Agreement") and the preferred stock purchase rights issued under or pursuant
thereto (the "Rights"), Discount has taken all actions necessary such that
the entering into of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not result in any Right becoming
exercisable.   Section 4.21 Noncompetition Agreements. Except as described
in the Discount Disclosure Schedule and except for ordinary and customary
restrictions in lease agreements, neither Discount nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any noncompetition agreement or any
other agreement or arrangement that limits or otherwise restricts Discount or
any of its Subsidiaries or any successor thereto or that would, after the
Effective Time, limit or restrict Holding, ASCI or the Surviving Corporation
or any of its affiliates or any successors thereto, from engaging or
competing in any line of business or in any geographical area.   Section
4.22 Suppliers. Neither Discount nor its Subsidiaries has received notice,
and Discount does not otherwise have Knowledge, that any of their suppliers
or vendors with whom Discount and its Subsidiaries engage in $1,000,000 or
more in business annually ("significant vendors") intend to cancel, terminate
or otherwise materially modify such significant vendor\'s relationship with
Discount or its Subsidiaries, including with respect to credit terms or any
requirement that Discount or its Subsidiaries provide letters of credit, nor,
to the Knowledge of Discount, has any such significant vendor threatened such
action as a result of execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which in the case of any of the foregoing,
is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth
on the Discount Disclosure Schedule, no contracts with suppliers or vendors
of Discount or any of its Subsidiaries (and regardless of whether or not they
are "significant vendors," as defined in this Section 4.22) have terms
requiring Discount or its Subsidiaries to purchase any services, a product or
line of products exclusively from such supplier or vendor that extend for a
period beyond December 31, 2001.   Section 4.23 Potential Conflict of
Interest. As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth in the
Discount SEC Reports that have been filed and are publicly available prior to
the date hereof, since June 1, 1998, there have been no transactions,
agreements, arrangements or understandings between Discount or any of it
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any other person, on the other hand, that
would be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K under the
Securities Act.   24    ARTICLE 5   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

arranged in paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections
contained in this Article 5 (and in the other Articles of this Agreement) and
the disclosure in any paragraph shall qualify other sections in this Article
5 (and in the other Articles of this Agreement) to the extent that it is
readily apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it should also
qualify or apply to such other sections.   Section 5.1 Organization of
Holding, New Holding, ASCI and Merger Sub. Each of Holding, New Holding, ASCI
and Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing or of active status under the laws of the jurisdiction of its

occurred from the date of formation of New  Holding through the date of this
Agreement. There are no bonds,  debentures, notes or other indebtedness of
New Holding having the right  to vote (or convertible into securities having
the right to vote) on  any matters on which stockholders of New Holding may

which the  Reincorporation will be effectuated (the "New Holding Merger 
Agreement"), there are no obligations, contingent or otherwise, of New 
Holding or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise 
acquire any share of New Holding Common Stock, or the capital stock of  any
Subsidiary or to provide funds or make any material investment (in  the form

other entity other than guarantees of bank  obligations of Subsidiaries
entered into in connection with the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or investments in  Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement. Simultaneously with the execution and
delivery of this  Agreement, Holding and New Holding have executed and
delivered the New  Holding Merger Agreement which constitutes the valid and
binding  obligation of each of Holding and New Holding, enforceable against
each  of them in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and 
Equity Exception.   (c) Except as set forth in the Holding Disclosure
Schedule or as reserved  for future grants of options and warrants under the
Holding Option  Plans, there are no equity securities of any class of
Holding, New  Holding or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or any
security  exchangeable or convertible into or exercisable for such equity 
securities, issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding, and there are  no
options, warrants, equity securities, calls, rights, commitments, 
undertakings or agreements of any character to which Holding, New  Holding or

bound (including under letters of intent, whether  binding or nonbinding)
obligating Holding, New Holding or any of their  respective Subsidiaries to
issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be  issued, delivered or sold, additional
shares of capital stock or other  equity interests of Holding or any of its
Subsidiaries or obligating  Holding, New Holding or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to grant,  extend, accelerate the vesting of, otherwise modify
or amend or enter  into any such option, warrant, equity security, call,
right, commitment  or agreement. To the Knowledge of Holding or New Holding,

of all  liens, charges, encumbrances, options, rights of first refusal or 
limitations or agreements regarding voting rights of any nature. All of  the
outstanding shares of capital stock of ASCI and each of the other 
Subsidiaries of Holding or ASCI are owned beneficially and of record by 
Holding, ASCI or another Subsidiary free and clear of all liens,  charges,
encumbrances, options, rights of first refusal or limitations  or agreements
regarding voting rights of any nature. All of the  outstanding shares of
capital stock of ASCI and each of the other  Subsidiaries of Holding have
been validly issued and are fully paid and  nonassessable. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger  Sub have been validly issued
and are fully paid and nonassessable. New  Holding has no Subsidiaries, other

Filings and Consents.   (a) Each of Holding, New Holding, ASCI and Merger
Sub has all requisite  corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and  to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and  delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the

Merger  Sub have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the  part of each of Holding, New Holding, ASCI and Merger Sub (including 
the approval of the Merger by New Holding as the sole stockholder of  Merger
Sub). No vote of Holding\'s stockholders or of New Holding\'s  stockholders
is required to approve this Agreement or the transactions  contemplated
hereby except for the approval and authorization of  Holding\'s stockholders,
which approval and authorization will be sought  at a meeting to be called
for such purpose, and the approval and  authorization of New Holding\'s
stockholder of the Reincorporation,  which approval and authorization has
been obtained. This Agreement has  been duly executed and delivered by each
of Holding, New Holding,  Merger Sub and ASCI and constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of  each of Holding, New Holding, ASCI and Merger Sub,
enforceable against  each of them in accordance with its terms, subject to
the Bankruptcy  and Equity Exception.   (b) The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by each of Holding, New  Holding, ASCI and Merger Sub does
not, and the consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby will not,
(i) conflict with, or result  in any violation or breach of, any provision of
the Charter Documents  of Holding, New Holding, ASCI or Merger Sub, (ii)
result in any  violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice
or lapse  of time, or both) a default (or give rise to a right of
termination,  cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any
material  benefit) under, or require a consent or waiver under, any of the
terms,  conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
lease,  loan, credit agreement, contract or other agreement, instrument or 
obligation to which Holding or any of its Subsidiaries or New Holding  or
Merger Sub is a party or by which any of them or any of their  properties or
assets may be bound, or (iii) conflict with, violate, or  cause the
termination of any instrument, permit, concession, franchise,  license,
judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or  regulation
applicable to Holding or any of its Subsidiaries or New  Holding or Merger
Sub or any of its or their properties or assets,  except, in the case of (ii)
and (iii), for any such conflicts,  violations, defaults, terminations,
cancellations or accelerations  which are not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably likely to  have a Material Adverse Effect.   (c) No
consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,  declaration
or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required by or  with respect to
Holding or any of its Subsidiaries or New Holding or  Merger Sub in
connection with the execution and delivery of this  Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,  except for (i) the
filing of the pre-merger notification report under  the HSR Act and otherwise
satisfying the requirements of the HSR Act,  (ii) the filing of the Articles
of Merger with the Department of State  of the State of Florida and
appropriate documents with the relevant  authorities of the other
jurisdictions in which Discount is qualified  to do business, (iii) the
simultaneous merger of Holding with and into  New Holding (iv) the filing of
the Registration Statement with the SEC  in accordance with the Securities
Act, (v) the filing of the Articles  of Merger with respect to the
Reincorporation with the State  Corporation Commission of Virginia, (vi) such
consents, approvals,  orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations and
filings as may  be required under applicable state securities laws and the
laws of any  foreign country and (vii) such other consents, authorizations,
filings,  approvals and registrations which, if not obtained or made, would
not  be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.   Section 5.4
Financing. Holding has, or has received binding (subject to the terms and
conditions thereof) written commitments from financially
responsible financial institutions to obtain, the funds necessary to pay the
cash portion of the Merger Consideration and the Option Merger Consideration
as provided in Article 3, to refinance the existing senior credit facilities
of ASCI as more specifically listed on Schedule A to this Agreement, to repay
certain indebtedness of Discount as more specifically listed on Schedule B to
this Agreement, and to pay related fees and expenses, and will make such
funds available to the Surviving   27   Corporation. Holding has
provided Discount with true and complete copies of all commitments and
agreements from third parties to provide such financing to Holding or ASCI
(the "Commitments"). As of the date hereof, each of the Commitments is in
full force and effect, and neither Holding nor ASCI has any reason to expect
that such Commitments will not remain in full force and effect or that the
conditions included in any of the Commitments will not be satisfied before
the Effective Time. Holding believes that the financing described in this
Section 5.4 is sufficient to enable Holding, New Holding and the
Surviving Corporation to complete the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Holding shall give Discount prompt notice of any change with
respect to such financing that would adversely affect the ability of Holding,
New Holding or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger.   Section 5.5 SEC
Filings; Financial Statements.   (a) Since April 15, 1998, and except to the
extent that their failure to do  so would not be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect,  Holding and/or its Subsidiaries have filed all
forms, reports,  registration statements, prospectuses, schedules, statements
and  documents, including the exhibits thereto, required to be filed by 
Holding and/or its Subsidiaries with the SEC under the Securities Act  or the
Exchange Act, including without limitation the Exchange Act  Filings (these
forms, reports, registration statements, prospectuses,  schedules, statements
and documents, including the exhibits thereto,  are referred to collectively
as "Holding SEC Reports"). Each Holding  SEC Report (i) at the time filed
complied in all material respects with  the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act,  as the case may be, and (ii) did not at
the time filed (or if amended  or superseded by a filing prior to the date of
this Agreement, then on  the date of such filing) contain any untrue
statement of a material  fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated in such  Holding SEC Report or necessary in order to make the
statements in such  Holding SEC Report, in the light of the circumstances
under which they  were made, not misleading. Other than ASCI, none of
Holding\'s  Subsidiaries is required to file any forms, reports or other
documents  with the SEC.   (b) Each of the consolidated financial
statements (including, in each case,  any related notes) contained in the
Holding SEC Reports, as of the date  of the applicable Holding SEC Report
(collectively, the "Holding  Financial Statements"), complied as to form in
all material respects  with the applicable published rules and regulations of
the SEC with  respect thereto, were prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP
applied on  a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may
be  indicated in the notes to such Holding Financial Statements, in the 
Holding SEC Reports, or, in the case of unaudited interim financial 
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly presented  the
consolidated financial position of Holding and its Subsidiaries as  of the
dates and the consolidated results of its operations and cash  flows for the
periods indicated, except that the unaudited financial  statements were or
are subject to normal and recurring year-end  adjustments and may not contain
all of the footnotes required by U.S.  GAAP. The unaudited balance sheet of
Holding as of April 21, 2001 is  referred to herein as the "Holding Balance
Sheet."   Section 5.6 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as set forth on the
Holding Disclosure Schedule or as disclosed in the Holding SEC Reports that
have been filed and are publicly available prior to the date hereof, and
except for normal or recurring liabilities incurred since the date of the
Holding Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practices, Holding and its Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities, either
accrued, contingent or otherwise (whether or not required to be reflected in
financial statements in accordance with GAAP), and whether due or to become
due, which individually or in the aggregate, have had or will have a Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 5.7 Taxes.   (a) Holding and each of its
Subsidiaries, and any consolidated, combined,  unitary or aggregate group for
tax purposes of which Holding or any of  its Subsidiaries is or has been a
member, has timely filed all material  Tax Returns required to be filed by it
in the manner provided by law  and has paid all Taxes shown thereon to be
due.   28    (b) Holding has made available to Discount complete, current
and correct  copies of the federal Tax Returns of Holding and the Holding 
Subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended in 1998 and 1999.   Section 5.8
Employee Benefit Plans.   (a) Holding has listed in the Holding Disclosure
Schedule all material  employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of
the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"))
and all  material stock option, stock purchase, incentive, deferred 
compensation, supplemental retirement or severance plans or agreements,  for
the benefit of, or relating to, any current or former employee,  director or
independent contractor providing services to Holding, any  Holding
Subsidiary, or any entity which is a member (an "ERISA  Affiliate") of (i) a
controlled group of corporations, (ii) a group of  trades or businesses
(whether or not incorporated) under common control  with Holding, or (iii) an
affiliated service group, all within the  meaning of Section 414 of the Code,
which includes Holding, or any  Subsidiary of Holding (together, the "Holding
Employee Plans").   (b) With respect to the Holding Employee Plans,
individually and in the  aggregate, no event has occurred and, to the
Knowledge of Holding,  there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in
connection with  which Holding could be subject to any liability under ERISA,
the Code  or any other applicable law where such liability is reasonably
likely  to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (c) With respect to the
Holding Employee Plans, individually and in the  aggregate, and except as set
forth on the Holding Disclosure Schedule,  there are no funded benefit
obligations for which contributions have  not been made or properly accrued
and there are no unfunded benefit  obligations which have not been accounted
for by reserves, or otherwise  properly footnoted, in either case in
accordance with GAAP, on the  financial statements of Holding, which
obligations are reasonably  likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (d)
Except as disclosed in the Holding Disclosure Schedule, (i) there are  no
pending or, to the Knowledge of Holding, threatened claims, actions,  suits,
termination proceedings, or investigations by any Governmental  Entity
against or involving any Holding Employee Plan and (ii) any  Holding Employee
Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of  the Code has received
a determination letter from the Internal Revenue  Service to that effect,
which has not been revoked, and nothing has  occurred since the date of the
most recent determination letter that  would materially and adversely affect
such qualification.   Section 5.9 Compliance With Laws. Holding and its
Subsidiaries have complied with, are not in violation of, and have not
received any written notice that they have been or are in violation of, any
federal, state or local statute, law or regulation or any judgment, decree or
order of any Governmental Entity with respect to the conduct of their
respective business, or the ownership or operation of their respective
businesses, except for failures to comply or violations which, individually
or in the aggregate, have not been fully resolved with no continuing material
liability to Holding and the Holding Subsidiaries or are not reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. Holding and its Subsidiaries have
in effect all federal, state, local and foreign governmental approvals,
authorizations, certificates, filings, franchises, notices, permits,
variances and rights ("Holding Approvals") necessary for them to own or lease
and operate their properties and assets and to carry on their respective
businesses as now conducted and there has occurred no default under any
Holding Approval, or failure to obtain such Holding Approval, which would
individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect.   Section
5.10 Labor Matters. Neither Holding nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
or otherwise bound by or subject to any collective bargaining agreement,
contract or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor
organization, nor, as of the date hereof, is Holding or any of
its Subsidiaries the subject of any material proceeding asserting that
Holding or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice,
has failed to bargain, has denied recognition, or has otherwise interfered
with the representation rights of any labor union or labor organization nor,
as of the date of this Agreement, is there pending or, to the  
29   Knowledge of Holding, threatened, any material labor strike, dispute,
walkout, work stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving Holding or any of
its Subsidiaries, nor, as of the date of this Agreement, has Holding or any
of its Subsidiaries been requested within the last three years to recognize
or bargain with any labor union or labor organization with respect to any
employees of Holding or any of its Subsidiaries.   Section 5.11
Environmental Matters.   (a) Except as described in the Holding Disclosure
Schedule, to the  Knowledge of Holding: (i) Holding and the Holding
Subsidiaries have  complied in all respects with, and are currently in
compliance in all  respects with all applicable Environmental Laws except for
any  noncompliance that would not reasonably be expected to result in a 
Material Adverse Effect; (ii) the properties currently owned, leased or 
operated by Holding and the Holding Subsidiaries (including soils, 
groundwater, surface water, buildings or other structures) are in  compliance
in all respects with all applicable Environmental Laws, and  are not
contaminated with any Hazardous Substances in a manner so as to  create any
liability for Holding and the Holding Subsidiaries, except  for any
noncompliance or contamination or liability that would not  reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; (iii)  the properties
formerly owned, leased or operated by Holding or any of  the Holding
Subsidiaries were in compliance in all material respects  with all applicable
Environmental Laws, and were not contaminated with  Hazardous Substances
during the period of ownership or operation by  Holding or any of the Holding
Subsidiaries in a manner so as to create  any liability for Holding and the
Holding Subsidiaries, except for any  noncompliance or contamination that
would not reasonably be expected to  result in a Material Adverse Effect;
(iv) neither Holding nor any of  the Holding Subsidiaries are or are alleged
to be subject to any  liability for any Hazardous Substance disposal or
contamination on the  property of any third party, except for any liability
or contamination  that would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse  Effect; (v) neither Holding nor any of the Holding
Subsidiaries have  released any Hazardous Substance except in compliance in
all material  respects with applicable Environmental Law other than such 
noncompliance that would not reasonably be expected to result in a  Material
Adverse Effect; and (vi) neither Holding nor any of the  Holding Subsidiaries
has received any written notice, demand, letter,  claim or request for
information alleging that any of the properties  currently or previously
owned, leased or operated by Holding or any of  the Holding Subsidiaries, or
Holding or any of the Holding Subsidiaries  may be in violation of, liable
under or have obligations under any  Environmental Law, except for such
violations, liabilities and  obligations that would not reasonably be
expected to result in a  Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Section 5.11, (A) a  property will be deemed to be "contaminated" with a
Hazardous Substance  only if the Hazardous Substance is present in such
quantity as to give  rise to any remediation obligation or other liability
under applicable  Environmental Laws, and (B) Holding and its Subsidiaries
shall include  (x) all partnerships, joint ventures and other entities in
which any of  them was at any time a partner, joint venturer, member or
participant  and (y) all predecessor or former entities, whether or not in
existence  as of the date hereof, the assets or obligations of which have
been  acquired or assumed by any of them or to which any of them has 
succeeded.   (b) The representations and warranties in this Section 5.11 are
intended to  be the only representations and warranties of Holding relating
to  environmental matters. No other representation or warranty made by 
Holding shall extend to or cover such matters, even though it is, by  its
terms, broad enough to do so.   Section 5.12 Absence of Certain Changes or
Events. Except as disclosed in the Holding SEC Reports that have been filed
and are publicly available prior to the date hereof or the Holding Disclosure
Schedule, since the date of the Holding Balance Sheet, Holding and its
Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only in the ordinary course and
in a manner consistent with recent past practice and, since such date, there
has not been (i) any change in the financial condition, results of
operations, business, prospects, assets or properties of Holding and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that has had, or will have, a Material
Adverse Effect; (ii) any damage, destruction or loss (whether or not covered
by insurance) with respect to Holding or any of its Subsidiaries that has

change by Holding   30   in its accounting methods, principles or
practices to which Discount has not previously consented in writing; (iv) any
revaluation by Holding of any of its assets that has had, or will have, a
Holding Material Adverse Effect; or (v) any other action or event that would
have required the consent of Discount pursuant to Section 6.2 of this
Agreement had such action or event occurred after the date of this
Agreement.   Section 5.13 Registration Statement; Blue Sky Filings;
Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Other Information. Neither the Registration
Statement nor Blue Sky Filings, nor any of the information supplied or to be

other documents to be filed with the SEC or any regulatory agency in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby will, at the respective

the circumstances under which it shall be made, be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in

omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any statement in any
earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of any proxy for such
meeting. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event relating to
Holding, New Holding or any of their affiliates, officers or directors is
discovered by Holding that should be set forth in an amendment to the
Registration Statement or Blue Sky Filings or a supplement to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Holding will promptly inform Discount, and
Discount shall cooperate so as to enable such amendment or supplement to be
promptly filed with the SEC and appropriate state securities administrators,
and disseminated to the stockholders of Discount, to the extent required by
applicable federal and state securities laws. All documents which Holding,
New Holding or their respective Subsidiaries file or are responsible for
filing with the SEC and any regulatory agency in connection with the Merger
will comply as to form and, to the extent provided by Holding, New Holding or
their respective Subsidiaries, as to content, in each case in all material
respects with the provisions of applicable law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Holding, ASCI, New Holding and Merger Sub make no representations
or warranties with respect to any information that has been supplied by
Discount or its auditors, attorneys, financial advisors, other consultants or
advisors specifically for use in the Registration Statement, Blue Sky
Filings, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or in any other documents to be
filed by Holding, New Holding or their respective Subsidiaries with the SEC
or any regulatory agency in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.   Section 5.14 Litigation. Except as described in the Holding SEC
Reports that have been filed and are publicly available prior to the date
hereof or as set forth on the Holding Disclosure Schedule, there is no
action, suit or proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation against
Holding, New Holding or any of their respective Subsidiaries pending or as to
which Holding, New Holding or any of their respective Subsidiaries has
received any written notice of assertion, which, individually or in the
aggregate, will have a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect
on the ability of Holding, New Holding, ASCI or Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There is no judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitration
outstanding against Holding, New Holding or any of their respective
Subsidiaries having or which is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 5.15 Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other Person, other than J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., The Chase
Manhattan Bank, Credit Suisse First Boston and Lehman Commercial Paper Inc.
the fees of which are the obligation of Holding and ASCI, is entitled to any
broker\'s, finder\'s, investment banker\'s, financial advisor\'s or other
similar fee or commission in connection with the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Holding
ASCI, New Holding or Merger Sub. Holding has delivered to Discount a fully
executed copy of its engagement letter with J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.

hereof, and each such engagement letter remains in full force and effect as
of the date hereof.   31    Section 5.16 New Holding and Merger Sub.

and liabilities incurred and reasonably contemplated in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 5.17 No Other

Holding, ASCI or Merger Sub or any of their respective representatives or
agents are negotiating the acquisition of, or an agreement to acquire by

or by any other manner, any business or any corporation, partnership or other
business organization or division (other than Discount) or otherwise to
acquire or agree to acquire any assets other than in the ordinary course of
business, which in any such case would be material to Holding and ASCI, taken

Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this
Agreement or the Effective Time, Holding, ASCI and New Holding agree as

provided  that there shall be no such grants of options or other rights to
any of  the Principal Holding Stockholders or to any of their respective 
Affiliates in connection with such a purchase or acquisition  transaction

Holding, in reasonable good faith, based on full  and fair disclosure to the
Board of Directors of Holding, to be no less  favorable to Holding than are
available from any unaffiliated third  party and provided further that such
grants (A) dilute all stockholders  of Holding (after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by  this Agreement, so that such dilutive impact is
measured on a pro forma  basis as if the stockholders of Discount were then
holding New Holding  Common Stock as a result of the Merger) on a pro rata
basis, (B) are  fully disclosed to Discount promptly following such grants
and, (C) to  the extent such grants, individually or collectively, could
reasonably  be considered material to the Discount stockholders in their

with the  purchase or acquisition of another entity, whether by acquisition
of  assets, merger, tender offer, stock purchase, consolidation or 
recapitalization, subject in all respects to being in compliance with 
Holding\'s obligations under Section 6.2(g); provided, that such  issuances
and sales (x) dilute all stockholders of Holding (after  giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, so  that such dilutive impact
is   35    measured on a pro forma basis as if the stockholders of
Discount were  then holding New Holding Common Stock as a result of the
Merger) on a  pro rata basis, (y) are fully disclosed to Discount promptly
following  such issuances and sales and, (z) to the extent such issuances

part of or by way of amendment or supplement to the  Proxy
Statement/Prospectus prior to the taking of the Discount  Stockholder Vote
and as promptly as reasonably possible following such  issuance or sale and,

this Agreement or  granted thereafter in compliance with the terms of
subsection (a) of  this Section 6.2;   (c) enter into any transaction or
series of related transactions with any  Affiliate of Holding, ASCI, New
Holding or Merger Sub unless such  transaction is entered into and
consummated on terms (as determined in  reasonable good faith based on full

favorable to Holding, ASCI, New  Holding and Merger Sub than are available
from an unaffiliated third  party and is not otherwise prohibited under any
other subsection of  this Section 6.2;   (d) change in any material respect
its methods of accounting as in effect  at the date of the Holding Balance
Sheet, except insofar as such change  may be required by GAAP;   (e) adopt,

stockholders,  (ii) amend the terms of or reclassify, or effect a stock split

capital structure except (x) in connection with financing  transactions
entered into in order to effectuate the consummation of  the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as more particularly  expressly described in
the Commitments, and (y) as may be necessary to  consummate the permitted
purchase or acquisition of another entity,  whether by acquisition of assets,
merger, tender offer, stock purchase,  consolidation or recapitalization
subject in all respects to being in  compliance with Holding\'s obligations
under Section 6.3(g) and provided  that such amendment, reclassification,
stock split, combination,  distribution or capital structure alteration would
not impact (after  giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, so  that such impact is measured on a pro forma basis as if the 
stockholders of Discount were then holding New Holding Common Stock as  a
result of the Merger) any such common stockholder of New Holding in a  manner
disproportionate to the relative stock ownership of such common  stockholder
otherwise contemplated by the Merger and the  Reincorporation, (iii) pay any

delay or materially adversely impair the ability  of Holding, New Holding and
ASCI to satisfy the conditions to, and/or  to secure, the financing
contemplated by or under the Commitments.   Section 6.3 Cooperation;
Access.   (a) Subject to compliance with applicable law, from the date
hereof until  the Effective Time, each of Holding and Discount shall confer
on a  regular and frequent basis with one or more representatives of the 
other party to report on the general status of ongoing operations and  shall
promptly provide the other party or its counsel with copies of  all filings
made by such party with any Governmental Entity in  connection with this
Agreement, the Merger and the transactions  contemplated hereby and thereby,
or with the SEC pursuant to the  Exchange Act.   (b) Prior to the Closing,
Discount will, and will cause each of its  Subsidiaries to, permit
representatives of Holding and ASCI to have  full access at all reasonable
times and with reasonable advance notice,  and in a manner so as not to
interfere with the normal business  operations of Discount and its
Subsidiaries, to all premises,  properties, officers (and any other specific
employees to whom such  officers may expressly authorize access in writing
from time to time),  books, records (including Tax records), contracts,
commitments and  documents of or pertaining to each of Discount and its
Subsidiaries and  to conduct such inspections and investigations as Holding
and ASCI may  reasonably require; provided, however, that, prior to the
expiration or  termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act or other
similar  law applicable to the transaction, Holding and ASCI shall only be 
permitted such reasonable access which, in their discretion, after 
consultation with their counsel, is appropriate during such inspection  and
investigation process and provided further, Discount may withhold  such
portions of documents or information relating to pricing or other  matters
that are highly sensitive and the exchange of such documents  (or portions
thereof) or information, as determined by Discount or  Discount\'s outside
legal counsel, that might reasonably result in  antitrust difficulties
between Discount and Holding (or any of its  Affiliates). If any material is
withheld from Holding or ASCI pursuant  to the second proviso of the
preceding sentence, Discount shall inform  Holding as to what is being
withheld. No information or knowledge  obtained in any investigation pursuant
to this Section 6.3 shall affect  or be deemed to modify any representation
or warranty contained in the  Agreement or the conditions to the obligations
of the parties to  consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The  confidentiality of all such documents and information
furnished in  connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall  be governed by the terms of Section 6.4. In addition to the
foregoing,  with respect to the Designated Discount Real Properties, Discount
shall  use its best efforts to complete any and all environmental 
questionnaires that may be required or deemed necessary by Holding and  ASCI;
and, if required and to the extent required by the providers of  the
Commitments, Discount shall arrange for environmental reports to be  prepared
and/or further testing to be conducted with respect to those  Designated
Discount Real Properties for which the providers of the  Commitments may so
require the preparation of such reports and/or  conduct of further testing.
The cost of any such environmental reports  and any such further testing
shall be borne by Discount.   (c) Prior to the Closing, Holding will, and
will cause each of its  Subsidiaries to, permit representatives of Discount
to have access at  all reasonable times and with reasonable advance notice,
and in a  manner so as not to interfere with the normal business operations
of  Holding and its Subsidiaries, to such premises, properties, books, 
records (including Tax records), contracts, commitments and documents  
37    of or pertaining to each of Holding and its Subsidiaries and to
conduct  such inspections and investigations in all cases only as Discount
may  reasonably believe is necessary in order to confirm the accuracy of
the  representations and warranties of Holding and ASCI (if Discount 
reasonably believes that a representation or warranty may have been 
breached), the compliance by Holding and ASCI of their respective  covenants
under this Agreement, and the satisfaction of the conditions  to Discount\'s
obligation to consummate the transactions hereunder;  provided, however,
that, prior to the expiration or termination of any  waiting period under the
HSR Act or other similar law applicable to the  transaction, Discount shall
only be permitted such reasonable access  which, in their discretion, after
consultation with their counsel, is  appropriate during such inspection and
investigation process and  provided further, Holding may withhold such
portions of documents or  information relating to pricing or other matters
that are highly  sensitive and the exchange of such documents (or portions
thereof) or  information, as determined by Holding or Holding\'s outside
legal  counsel, might reasonably result in antitrust difficulties between 
Discount and Holding (or any of its Affiliates). If any material is  withheld
from Discount pursuant to the second proviso of the preceding  sentence,
Holding shall inform Discount as to what is being withheld.  No information
or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to  this Section 6.3
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation  or warranty contained
in the Agreement or the conditions to the  obligations of the parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement. The
confidentiality of all such documents and  information furnished in
connection with the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement shall be
governed by the terms of Section 6.4.   Section 6.4 Confidentiality. The
parties acknowledge that ASCI has previously executed a confidentiality
agreement dated as of March 15, 2001 and Discount has previously executed a
confidentiality agreement dated as of June 12, 2001 (the "Confidentiality
Agreements"), which Confidentiality Agreements will continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms, except as expressly modified
herein, until the Effective Time, and if this Agreement is terminated or if
the Effective Time shall not have occurred for any reason whatsoever, the
Confidentiality Agreements shall thereafter remain in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party
hereby expressly consents to the disclosure of any information subject to the
Confidentiality Agreements required to be disclosed by applicable law in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, that the parties shall consult with one another prior to
the disclosure of any such information.   Section 6.5 Notices of Certain
Events. Each of Holding and New Holding, on the one hand and Discount, on the
other hand, shall give prompt notice to the other of (i) any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Merger; (ii) any notice of other
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or
any party\'s filings under the Exchange Act; and (iii) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to its knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting Holding,
New Holding or Discount or their respective Subsidiaries that relate to the
consummation of the Merger. Each of Holding and Discount will use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other if, in the
course of such party\'s investigations with respect to the other and
the other\'s Affiliates, such party obtains knowledge that any representation
or warranty of the other is, or is reasonably expected to be, untrue or
inaccurate so as to have a Material Adverse Effect.   ARTICLE 7  
ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS   Section 7.1 No Solicitation.   (a) From the date
hereof until the Effective Time, Discount shall  immediately cease and desist
and discontinue and cause to be terminated  any and all existing activities
with respect to any of the following  and shall not, nor shall it authorize
or permit any of its  Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly,   38    to,
nor shall it authorize or permit any officer, director, affiliate,  employee,
attorney, accountant, financial advisor, independent  representative or
independent agent or any other advisor or  representative of Discount or of
any of its Subsidiaries to, solicit,  initiate, encourage or take any action
to facilitate (including by way  of furnishing information or engaging in
discussions or negotiations)  any inquiries, proposals or offers that
constitute, or could reasonably  be expected to lead to or relate to, a
proposal or offer to acquire any  assets, business or properties of Discount
or any of its Subsidiaries  other than assets, businesses or properties that
are permitted to be  sold by Discount and its Subsidiaries pursuant to
Section 6.1 or any  part of the capital stock of Discount or any of its
Subsidiaries,  whether by merger, share purchase or exchange,
reorganization,  recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, consolidation,
business  combination, purchase of assets, tender offer, exchange offer or 
similar transaction, whether for cash, securities or any other  consideration
or combination thereof other than the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement and other than another transaction or  series of related
transactions in which Holding, New Holding or a  Subsidiary of Holding or of
New Holding is the acquiring Person (any of  the foregoing inquiries or
proposals being referred to in this  Agreement as an "Acquisition Proposal");
provided, however, that if, at  any time prior to the Discount Stockholder
Vote on this Agreement, the  Plan of Merger and the Merger, the Board of
Directors of Discount  determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that  failure to do so would constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties to  Discount\'s stockholders under applicable law, Discount
in response to a  bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Discount
Board of  Directors determines in good faith is not subject to a financing 
contingency that is more uncertain or conditioned than the financing 
contingency applicable to the Merger that is contained in the  Commitments
described in Section 8.2(h) of this Agreement and, if  consummated, would
constitute a Superior Proposal, and that was  unsolicited or that did not
otherwise result from a breach of this  section, may, (x) furnish non-public
information with respect to  Discount to the Person or group who made such
Acquisition Proposal  pursuant to a confidentiality agreement containing
confidentiality  terms at least as stringent as those contained in the
Confidentiality  Agreement protecting information of Discount and executed by
ASCI and  (y) participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such 
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Discount agrees  not to
release any third party from, or waive any provision of, any  confidentiality
agreement between Discount and another Person  previously entered into by
Discount in the course of Discount\'s efforts  to identify an acquisition
partner, unless the Board of Directors of  Discount determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside  legal counsel, that such action is necessary
for the Board of Directors  to comply with its fiduciary duties to
Discount\'s stockholders and to  enable such third party to communicate with
and make an Acquisition  Proposal addressed to the Board of Directors of
Discount, and in such  event, such waiver shall only be made to the extent
necessary to permit  such third party to make such Acquisition Proposal
directly to the  Board of Directors of Discount, to negotiate a Superior
Proposal with  the Board of Directors of Discount, and/or to enter into and
to  consummate a Superior Proposal that is ultimately approved by the Board 
of Directors of Discount. No other provisions of such confidentiality 
agreement shall be released or waived, and no authorization shall be  given
to such third party to obtain proxies, voting agreements, options  or option
agreements or to purchase shares of any shareholder of  Discount other than
pursuant to a tender offer approved by Discount\'s  Board of Directors in
connection with and as part of consummating a  Superior Proposal. In the
event that the Board of Directors of Discount  determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal  counsel, that such action is necessary
as described in the foregoing  two sentences, then the Board of Directors of
Discount shall concurrent  with its release of such third party from those
provisions of the  confidentiality agreement between Discount and such person
that are  necessary to accomplish the foregoing, simultaneously release
Holding  and ASCI from the comparable provisions of their Confidentiality 
Agreement previously entered into with Discount. In addition, in the  event
that any third party that has not entered into a confidentiality  agreement
with Discount takes any action or actions that would lead to  or constitutes
an Acquisition Proposal, then the Board of Directors of  Discount shall
immediately release Holding and ASCI from those   39    provisions of
their Confidentiality Agreement previously entered into  with Discount that
would enable Holding and ASCI to take such action or  actions comparable to
those then being taken by such third party.   (b) For these purposes, a
"Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide  unsolicited written proposal
made by a third party to acquire all or  substantially all the equity
securities or assets of Discount, pursuant  to a tender offer or exchange
offer, a merger, a consolidation, a  liquidation or dissolution, a
recapitalization, a sale of all or  substantially all of its assets or a
similar transaction, (i) on terms  which the Board of Directors of Discount
determines in their good faith  judgment is more favorable from a financial
point of view for the  holders of Discount Common Stock than the Merger,
after consultation  with its outside counsel and financial advisor, taking
into account all  the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including  any proposal in the form of a firm commitment by
Holding to amend the  terms of the Merger) and (ii) that is not subject to a
financing  contingency that is more uncertain or conditioned than the
financing  contingency applicable to the Merger that is contained in the 
Commitments described in Section 8.2(h) of this Agreement and is  reasonably
capable of being completed, taking into account all  financial, regulatory,
legal and other aspects of such proposal and the  Person making such
proposal.   (c) Nothing contained in this Section 7.1 shall prohibit
Discount from at  any time taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position  contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) of the Exchange Act with regard to
an  Acquisition Proposal.   (d) Neither the Board of Directors of Discount,
nor any committee thereof,  shall withdraw, modify or qualify (or propose to
withdraw, modify or  qualify) the Discount Recommendation in any manner
adverse to Holding  or ASCI, or take any action or make any statement in
connection with  the Discount Meeting inconsistent with such Discount
Recommendation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the
Discount  stockholder vote on this Agreement, the Plan of Merger and the
Merger,  the Board of Directors of Discount may, in response to a Superior 
Proposal that was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a  breach of
this Section 7.1, withdraw, modify or qualify the Discount  Recommendation if
the Board of Directors of Discount determines, in  good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that its fiduciary  obligations require it
to do so.   (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) two (2) Business Days
prior to  providing any information to any Person or entering into
discussions or  negotiations with any such Person regarding such Superior
Proposal,  Discount shall notify Holding promptly of such inquiries or
proposals  received by, any such information requested from, or any such 
discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with,  any of
Discount\'s authorized representatives indicating, in connection  with such
notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and  conditions of any
inquiries, proposals or offers, and Discount agrees  that it will keep
Holding informed in all material respects of the  status and terms of any
such inquiries, proposals or offers, and not  enter into any agreements which
would prohibit or impair its obligation  to do so hereunder, and (ii)
Discount shall not terminate this  Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(g) nor
enter into an agreement with  respect to a Superior Proposal unless Discount
shall have first (x)  furnished Holding with written notice not later than
12:00 noon (New  York time) five (5) Business Days in advance of any date
that it  intends to terminate this Agreement and enter into such agreement,
and  (y) caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate with Holding 
during such five day period in an effort to make such adjustments in  the
terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable Discount to  proceed
with the transactions contemplated hereby on such adjusted  terms. In
addition, as provided for in Section 9.3, if Discount enters  into an
agreement with respect to any Superior Proposal, it shall  concurrently with
or prior to entering into such agreement pay, or  cause to be paid, to ASCI
the Termination Fee (as defined in Section  9.3), plus any amounts payable
for Expenses pursuant to the provisions  of Section 9.3.   (f)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Holding shall have received notice  from
Discount pursuant to the provisions of either Section 7.1(e)(i) or  Section
7.1(e)(ii) and then only in the case where such notice   40    is
received after the Rating Date, Holding shall have the right, by  written
notice to Discount given within five (5) Business Days of the  receipt of
such notice, to require Discount to call and hold the  Discount Meeting,
notwithstanding the existence of such Superior  Proposal, in which event (i)
Discount shall not have the right to  terminate this Agreement pursuant to
the provisions of Section 9.1(g)  and (ii) Holding shall not have the right
to terminate this Agreement  pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.1(e) due
to (x) any approval or  recommendation by the Board of Directors of Discount
of such Superior  Proposal reasonably considered necessary as a result of
such Superior  Proposal or adoption of a resolution to such effect, (y) any
withdrawal  or modification or qualification of its recommendation or
qualification  of its approval of this Agreement, the Plan of Merger or the
Merger by  the Board of Directors of Discount in a manner adverse to the
interests  of Holding or ASCI reasonably considered necessary as a result of
such  Superior Proposal or adoption of a resolution to such effect, or (z) 
any failure to include in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus the  recommendation
without adverse modification or qualification that the  stockholders of
Discount approve this Agreement, the Plan of Merger and  the Merger
reasonably considered necessary as a result of such Superior  Proposal. For
these purposes, the "Rating Date" shall mean the earlier  of (i) thirty (30)
days after the date of this Agreement or (ii) the  date on which Holding
delivers to Discount copies of letters from each  of Standard and Poors Rating
Service ("SandP;") and Moody\'s Investors  Service, Inc. ("Moody\'s") which
confirm that, with respect to ASCI\'s  Senior Subordinated Facility (as such
term is defined in the  Commitments), ASCI\'s senior subordinated debt, on a
pro forma basis,  after giving effect to the Transactions (as is defined in
the  Commitments), has been issued ratings from each of SandP; and Moody\'s, 
with such ratings (x) being B- or better, in the case of SandP;, and B3 or 
better, in the case of Moody\'s and (y) each having an "outlook" of  stable
or better.   Section 7.2 Proxy Statement/Prospectus; Registration Statement;
Stockholders Meeting.   (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution
of this Agreement,  Discount, ASCI, Holding and New Holding will (i) prepare
and file with  the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (as amended or 
supplemented, the "Registration Statement") relating to the adoption of  this
Agreement and the approval of the Merger and Plan of Merger by the 
stockholders of Discount pursuant to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus 
described in subsection (c) below and the registration under the  Securities
Act of the Stock Consideration included in the Merger  Consideration, and
(ii) file with state securities administrators such  registration statements
or other documents as may be required under  applicable blue sky laws to
qualify or register the Stock Consideration  in such states as are designated
by Discount (the "Blue Sky Filings").  Discount, ASCI, Holding and New
Holding will use their reasonable best  efforts to cause the Registration
Statement to become effective as soon  as practicable. Holding and New
Holding will notify Discount promptly  of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or its staff or from any  state securities administrators and of any
request by the SEC or its  staff or by any state securities administrators
for amendments or  supplements to the Registration Statement or any Blue Sky
Filings or  for additional information, and will supply Discount with copies
of all  correspondence between Holding, New Holding or any of their
respective  representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, its staff or any
state  securities administrators, on the other hand, with respect to the 
Registration Statement. If at any time prior to receipt of the  Stockholder
Approval there shall occur any event that should be set  forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,  Discount, Holding
and New Holding shall promptly prepare and arrange  for the mailing to
Discount stockholders such an amendment or  supplement. Each party will cause
its counsel and independent auditors,  promptly upon request therefor, to
deliver any consents, legal opinions  or "cold comfort" letters that may
reasonably be required by any party  or its financial advisor or agents in
connection with the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.   (b)
Discount hereby represents that its Board of Directors has (i)  determined
that the Merger is fair to and in the best interests of  Discount\'s
stockholders, (ii) approved the Merger and (iii) resolved to  recommend in
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus adoption of this Agreement  and authorization
of the Merger by the stockholders of Discount.   41    (c) Discount
agrees, subject to Section 7.1, that this Agreement shall be  submitted at
the Discount Meeting. As soon as practicable after the  date of this
Agreement and following the date on which the Proxy  Statement/Prospectus is
in a position to be mailed to the Discount  stockholders, Discount shall take
all action, to the extent necessary  in accordance with applicable law and
its Charter Documents, to convene  a meeting of its stockholders promptly to
consider and vote upon the  approval of the Merger, and Discount shall
prepare and file with the  SEC, subject to the prior approval of Holding,
which approval Holding  shall not unreasonably withhold, together with the
Registration  Statement, the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and proxy and other
filings  relating to the Discount Meeting as required by the Exchange Act.
The  term "Proxy Statement/Prospectus" shall mean such proxy statement at 
the time it initially is mailed to stockholders and all duly filed 
amendments or revisions made thereto, if any, similarly mailed. Notice  of
the Discount Meeting shall be mailed to the stockholders of Discount  along
with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Discount, Holding and ASCI  each shall
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and furnish the  information
required to be included in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus;  and Discount,
Holding and ASCI, as appropriate, shall respond promptly  to any comments
made by the SEC with respect to the Proxy  Statement/Prospectus and cause the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and proxy  to be mailed to Discount\'s
stockholders at the earliest practicable  time.   Section 7.3 NYSE Listing.
Discount agrees to use reasonable efforts to continue the listing of Discount
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange through the earlier of the
Closing or termination of this Agreement.   Section 7.4 Legal Conditions to
Merger.   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this  Agreement, and subject to Section 7.1 and 9.1(g), Discount, Holding, 
ASCI and New Holding shall use their respective reasonable best efforts  to
(i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or  cause to
be done, all things necessary and proper under applicable law  to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner  practicable, the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) obtain from any  Governmental Entity
any consents, licenses, permits, waivers,  approvals, authorizations, or
orders required to be obtained or made by  Discount or Holding or New Holding
or any of their Subsidiaries in  connection with the authorization, execution
and delivery of this  Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby  including, without limitation, the Merger, and (iii) as
promptly as  practicable, make all necessary material filings, and thereafter
make  any other required material submissions, with respect to this
Agreement  and the Merger required under (A) the Securities Act and the
Exchange  Act, and any other applicable federal or state securities laws, (B)
the  HSR Act and any related governmental request thereunder, and (C) any 
other applicable law. Discount, Holding, New Holding and ASCI shall 
cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such  filings,
including providing copies of all such documents to the non-  filing party
and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested, to  accept all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested in  connection therewith. Discount,
Holding, New Holding and ASCI shall use  reasonable commercial efforts to
furnish to each other all information  required for any application or other
filing to be made pursuant to the  rules and regulations of any applicable
law (including all information  required to be included in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus) in  connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. If  Discount is requested to do so in writing by Holding,
Discount will use  commercially reasonable efforts to obtain those Holding
Designated  Consents identified in such request; provided, however, that in
no  event shall Discount be required to pay any money or provide any 
guarantee to obtain such Holding Designated Consent; provided, further,  that
the failure to obtain any Holding Designated Consent shall not in  any way
prevent or delay the parties from closing the transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement. In connection therewith, and in  connection with its
negotiations for such Holding Designated Consents,  Discount may not offer or
consent to any modification or amendment of  any lease or other contract
without Holding\'s prior written consent  which consent may be withheld in
Holding\'s sole discretion. At  Holding\'s election,   42    Holding may
participate in and jointly control the process of obtaining  any such Holding
Designated Consents. Discount agrees to transmit the  form of requested
consent to the appropriate parties for approval  promptly after the execution
of this Agreement. Holding shall have the  right to approve the form of
consent and the transmittal letter used to  transmit such consents to each
such party. Discount shall keep Holding  advised of its progress in obtaining
such Holding Designated Consents  and shall obtain Holding\'s written consent
which consent may be  withheld in Holding\'s sole discretion prior to
offering or consenting  to any substantive change or modification of the form
of the consent  approved by Holding. The "Holding Designated Consents" are
set forth on  Schedule D to this Agreement and such Schedule D may be updated
from  time to time to add any material consents, material licenses,
material  permits, material waivers, material approvals or material 
authorizations that are discovered by Holding after the date of this 
Agreement. Discount shall take all necessary action so that the Senior  Term
Notes issued under the Note Purchase Agreement dated as of July  17, 1997 and
the Senior Secured Notes issued under the Note Agreement  dated as of October
30, 1989 may be repaid in full and retired on the  Closing Date. If requested
by Holding, Discount shall further take all  necessary action so that,
effective on the Closing Date, the Master  Lease Agreement dated as of May
30, 2000 between Atlantic Financial  Group, Ltd. and Discount Auto Parts
Distribution Center, Inc. and all  other documents related to said
transaction are terminated (except for  obligations that expressly survive
termination under the terms of such  documents, as such documents exist as of
the date hereof) and the real  property subject thereto is reacquired by
Discount in accordance with  their terms free and clear of all monetary liens
(other than any lien  for nondelinquent taxes) and take all other action
associated therewith  without any liability other than provided for in such
Master Lease  Agreement and the other related documents.   (b) Holding, New
Holding and Discount agree, and shall cause each of their  respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, to cooperate and to use  reasonable commercial
efforts to obtain any government clearances or  approvals required for
Closing under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as  amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act,  as amended, and any other
Federal, state or foreign law or, regulation  or decree designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions for the  purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade (collectively  "Antitrust Laws"), to respond to any
government requests for  information under any Antitrust Law and, unless
either Holding or New  Holding determines that there is a reasonable basis to
conclude that  such action is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect  either on Holding and its Subsidiaries, on Discount and its 
Subsidiaries or on the consolidated entities after the Merger and the 
Reincorporation and notifies Discount to such effect or Discount  determines
that there is a reasonable basis to conclude that such  action is reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the  consolidated entities after
the Merger and the Reincorporation and  notifies Holding to such effect, to
contest and resist any action,  brought by a private party under the
Antitrust Laws (a "Private Party  Action") , and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any  order, stay, decree, judgment, injunction or
other order (whether  temporary, preliminary or permanent) obtained by a
private party (a  "Private Party Order") that restricts, prevents or
prohibits the  consummation of the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by  this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. Holding and New
Holding shall  not be obligated to but may elect to contest and resist any
action  brought by a Governmental Entity, including any legislation, 
administrative or judicial action (a "Government Action"), or to seek  to
vacate, lift, reverse or overturn any order issued by a Governmental  Entity
as a consequence or arising out of an action brought by a  Governmental
Entity (a "Government Order") that restricts, prevents or  prohibits the
consummation of the Merger or any other transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement under any Antitrust Law. If Holding or  New Holding so elects,
Discount shall fully cooperate and assist  Holding and New Holding therewith.
The parties hereto will consult and  cooperate with one another, and consider
in good faith the views of one  another, in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations,  memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted  by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings  under or relating to   43    any Antitrust
Law. Holding, New Holding and Discount shall mutually  direct any proceedings
or negotiations with any private party relating  to proceedings under or
relating to any Antitrust Law and constituting  a Private Party Action or a
Private Party Order and shall share equally  the reasonable costs and
expenses incurred in connection therewith  (except that if such Private Party
Action or Private Party Order is to  be contested and Discount determines
that there is a reasonable basis  to conclude that such action is reasonably
likely to have a Material  Adverse Effect either on Holding and its
Subsidiaries, on Discount and  its Subsidiaries or on the consolidated
entities after the Merger and  the Reincorporation and notifies Holding to
such effect, the parties  shall not share the costs and expenses equally but
instead each party  shall bear its own costs and expenses). Holding and New
Holding shall  direct any proceedings or negotiations with any Governmental
Entity  relating to any Government Action or Government Order, and shall
afford  Discount a reasonable opportunity to participate therein, and
Discount  shall fully cooperate and assist Holding in any such proceedings
or  negotiations. Discount and its Subsidiaries shall cooperate with 
Holding and New Holding with respect to any action which Holding and/or  New
Holding shall choose to take in response to any demand,  requirement, or
other action taken by the United States Federal Trade  Commission ("FTC") or
the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ")  or any other regulatory body
or agency, including, but not limited to,  divesting any of its businesses,
retail stores, product lines or  assets; provided such divestitures or other
actions are not required to  be taken, completed or implemented until on or
after the Effective Time  and is not reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the  consolidated New Holding after the Merger and the
Reincorporation. If a  Private Party Action or a Private Party Order is
reasonably likely to  have a Material Adverse Effect either on Holding and
its Subsidiaries,  on Discount and its Subsidiaries or on the consolidated
entities after  the Merger and the Reincorporation, Holding shall not be
obligated to  consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
may  terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c). If a Private
Party  Action or a Private Party Order is reasonably likely to have a
Material  Adverse Effect on the consolidated entities after the Merger and
the  Reincorporation, Discount shall not be obligated to consummate the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and may terminate this  Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.1(c). Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary
contained in this Section 7.4, Holding, ASCI or their  Subsidiaries shall not
be required to (i) divest or agree to divest any  of their or Discount\'s and
its Subsidiaries\' respective businesses,  retail stores, product lines or
assets or to take or agree to take any  other action with respect to Holding,
New Holding, ASCI, Discount or  their respective Subsidiaries, or (ii) take
any other action under this  Section 7.4, if the DOJ or the FTC or any other
regulatory body or  agency authorizes its staff to seek a preliminary
injunction or  restraining order to enjoin consummation of the Merger. Each
Person  shall pay any filing fee required under the regulations promulgated 
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to its own filing thereunder.   Section
7.5 Public Disclosure. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release acceptable
to Holding and Discount. Thereafter, Holding and Discount shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statement or public filing with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement or
public filing prior to such consultation, except as, in the reasonable
judgment of the Board of Directors of either Holding or Discount, may be
required by law or the rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange.   Section 7.6 Certain Employee Benefit Plan Obligations.   (a)
During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending twelve  (12)
months thereafter, New Holding, ASCI and/or the Surviving  Corporation shall
provide the employees of Discount and the Discount  Subsidiaries (the
"Discount Employees") with benefits (other than stock  and stock-based
benefits and the value thereof) that are in the  aggregate substantially
equivalent to or more favorable than the  benefits provided to such employees
immediately before the Effective  Time by Discount and the Discount
Subsidiaries identified in the  Discount Disclosure Schedule; provided
however, this covenant shall not  prohibit changes in benefit plans required
by law or in the ordinary  course of   44    business on a basis
reasonably consistent with the practices of ASCI,  it being understood by
Discount, Holding, ASCI and New Holding that the  benefits provided by ASCI
to its employees on the date hereof (as  described in a schedule of benefits
delivered by ASCI to Discount)  satisfy such agreement. New Holding, ASCI and
the Surviving Corporation  will treat, and cause their benefit plans to
treat, the service of the  Discount Employees with Discount or any Discount
Subsidiary  attributable to any period before the Effective Time as service 
rendered to New Holding, ASCI and/or the Surviving Corporation, as 
applicable, for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting,  benefit
accrual and for other benefits including, but not limited to,  applicability
of minimum waiting periods for participation. Without  limiting the
foregoing, New Holding, ASCI and the Surviving Corporation  shall not, except
as may be required by applicable law, treat any  Discount Employee as a "new"
employee for purposes of any exclusions  under any health or similar plan of
New Holding, ASCI and/or the  Surviving Corporation for a pre-existing
medical condition, and will  make appropriate arrangements with its insurance
carrier(s) to ensure  such result.   (b) Following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall honor and  shall cause its Subsidiaries to honor
(i) in accordance with their  terms, all written individual employment,
termination, severance,  bonus, change in control, post-employment and other
written  compensation agreements, arrangements and plans existing prior to
the  execution of this Agreement and referred to in the Discount Disclosure 
Schedule ("Disclosed Discount Employment Arrangements"), which are  between
Discount or any Discount Subsidiary and any current or former  director,
officer or employee thereof, and (ii) all legally imposed  obligations
relating to employment matters pursuant to applicable law.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, no officer  or employee shall have
any right to continued employment or any other  right, except to the extent
specifically set forth in such officer\'s or  employee\'s Disclosed Discount

are  (x) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each  Person who is a counterparty to the Designated Arrangements, his or
her  heirs and his or her representatives and (y) in addition to, and not

from the applicable indemnified  Person to whom advances are to be advanced
of an undertaking to repay  such advances required under applicable law and

as are afforded to other directors and officers of Holding  and/or of New
Holding.   (b) For not less than six years after the Effective Time, New
Holding, ASCI  or the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect
Discount\'s  current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance covering
acts or  omissions occurring at and/or prior to the Effective Time with
respect  to those Persons who are currently covered by Discount\'s
directors\' and  officers\' liability insurance policy on terms with respect
to such  coverage and amount no less favorable in the aggregate to
Discount\'s  directors and officers currently covered by such insurance than
those  of such policy in effect on the date hereof; provided, that New
Holding  may substitute therefor policies of New Holding, ASCI or their 
Subsidiaries containing terms with respect to coverage and amount no  less
favorable to such directors or officers so long as no lapse in  coverage
occurs as a result of such substitution; provided, further,  that in no event
shall Holding or New Holding or the Surviving  Corporation be required to pay
annual premiums for such insurance in  excess of 150% of the annual premiums
currently paid by Discount for  such insurance and if New Holding and/or the
Surviving Corporation are  unable to obtain the insurance required by this
Section 7.7(b), they  shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible
for an annual  premium equal to such maximum amount. In the event that any
claim or  claims are asserted or made within such six-year period, such
insurance  shall be continued in respect of any such claim or claims until
final  disposition of any and all such claims.   (c) In the event that
either of the Surviving Corporation or New Holding or  ASCI or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates  with or merges with or
into any other Person and is not the continuing  or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or  (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties  and assets to any Person, then, and in

will assume the obligations  thereof set forth in this Section 7.7.   (d)

is not a Superior Proposal and, within  twelve (12) months of the Discount

shall pay to ASCI,  in cash by wire transfer in immediately available funds
to the ASCI  Account, the Termination Fee and any Expenses to the extent
not  previously paid by Discount (including those Expenses paid by Holding 
and/or ASCI) up to the Expense Cap when aggregated with any amount that  was
previously paid by Discount to ASCI following the Discount Meeting.   (c) If

of the failure of the closing condition set forth  in Section 8.2(d),
Discount shall pay to ASCI, within five (5) Business  Days of receipt from
Holding or ASCI of reasonably satisfactory  documentation thereof, in cash by
wire transfer in immediately  available funds to the ASCI Account, in the
case of termination as a  result of the failure of the closing condition set

this Section 9.3 which might be  considered to be to the contrary, ASCI shall
never be entitled to  receive more than one Termination Fee under this
Agreement and shall  never be entitled to be reimbursed for any item of

9.3,  wind up being achieved by way of two separate payments).   Section

the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented
