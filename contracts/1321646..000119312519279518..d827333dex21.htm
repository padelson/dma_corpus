ARTICLE 3

 

PURCHASE PRICE; CLOSING

 

 _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ _ _ _Purchase Price_. The aggregate amount to be
paid by Purchaser to Seller for the Acquired Assets shall be $530,000,000
(the " _Base Purchase Price_ ", and as adjusted pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.2_, the " _Purchase Price_ ").

 

 _Section_ __ _ 3.2_ _ _ _Purchase Price_ _Adjustments_.

 

(a) At least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
deliver an estimate prepared by Seller of the Purchase Price (the "
_Estimated Purchase Price_ "), calculated as:

(i) the Base Purchase Price, _plus_

(ii) an estimate of the amount of Cash held in the accounts of
the Acquired Entities as of the Closing Date (" _Estimated Cash_ "), _minus_

(iii) an estimate of the amount of Indebtedness of the Acquired Entities
as of the Closing Date (" _Estimated Debt_ "), _plus_ __

 

(iv) the difference (positive or negative value) obtained by subtracting
Target Working Capital from the Estimated Working Capital; _minus_

(v) the difference (positive or negative value) obtained by subtracting an
estimate of the amount of the costs and expenditures associated with the
Growth Capital Expansion Projects actually paid as of the Closing Date ("
_Estimated Cap Ex_ ") from $29,300,000.

 

For clarity, the Purchase Price includes an amount equal to Target Working
Capital. The Estimated Working Capital (and Closing Working Capital) shall
be calculated in a manner consistent with the manner in which the Target
Working Capital was calculated in accordance with _Schedule_ _3.2(a)_.

 

(b) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver
to Purchaser a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ "), certified by an
officer of Seller, setting forth (i) the Working Capital of the Cariflex
Business as of the close of business on the Closing Date (" _Closing Working
Capital_ "), (ii) the amount of Cash held in the accounts of the Acquired
Entities as of the Closing Date (" _Closing Cash_ "), (iii) the amount of
Indebtedness of the Acquired Entities as of the Closing Date (" _Closing Debt_
"), and (iv) the amount of the costs and expenditures associated with the
Growth Capital Expansion Projects as of the Closing Date (" _Closing Cap Ex_
"); provided that in the case of (iv), to the extent final information is
available as of the date on which the Closing Statement is prepared and
delivered. A physical inventory of the Finished Inventory, the IR Inventory,
the Raw Materials, the WIP Inventory and the Spare Parts shall be conducted by
Seller for the purpose of preparing the Closing Working Capital. For purposes
of calculating the Estimated Working Capital and Closing Working Capital, the
Finished Inventory, the Raw Materials, the WIP Inventory, the IR Inventory and
the Spare Parts will be valued at the book value for such inventory, raw
materials and spare parts.

(c) During the 30-day period following delivery of the Closing Statement
to Purchaser, Seller shall provide Purchaser with reasonable access to the
books and records and personnel of Seller necessary to enable Purchaser to
evaluate the accuracy of the Closing Statement. If Purchaser disagrees with
the determination of any component of the Closing Statement calculations, then
Purchaser shall notify Seller in writing (an " _Objection Notice_ ") of such
disagreement within 30 days after delivery of the Closing Statement, which
Objection Notice shall describe the nature of any such disagreement in
reasonable detail. If Purchaser does not deliver an Objection Notice to Seller
within such 30-day period, then the Closing Statement shall be conclusive and
binding upon the Parties.

(d) If Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve all disagreements
properly identified by Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(c)_ within 30
days after delivery to Seller of the Objection Notice, then such disagreements
shall be resolved by an independent accounting firm to be selected by the
mutual agreement by the Parties (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "), and
such determination shall be final and binding on the Parties. If Seller and
Purchaser cannot mutually agree on the identity of the Independent Accounting
Firm, then Seller and Purchaser shall each submit to the other Partys
independent auditor the name of an internationally-recognized accounting firm
that does not currently act as its independent auditor, and the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be selected by lot from these two firms. Any fees and
expenses relating to the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm in
respect of its services pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.2(d)_ shall be
paid 50% by Seller and 50% by Purchaser. The Independent Accounting Firm shall
be instructed to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform its services
within 20 days after submission of the dispute to it and, in any case, as
promptly as practicable after such submission.

(e) The Purchase Price shall be deemed:

 

(i) increased by: (1) the amount by which Closing Working Capital exceeds
Target Working Capital, (2) the amount by which Closing Cash exceeds
Estimated Cash, (3) the amount by which Estimated Debt exceeds Closing Debt,
and (4) the amount by which Closing Cap Ex exceeds $29,300,000; and

 

(ii) reduced by: (1) the amount by which Closing Working Capital is less
than Target Working Capital, (2) the amount by which Closing Cash is less
than Estimated Cash, (3) the amount by which Estimated Debt is less than
Closing Debt and (4) the amount by which Closing Cap Ex is less than
$29,300,000.

 

The Purchase Price as so increased or reduced pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
3.2(e)_, is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Adjusted Purchase Price_
". If the Adjusted Purchase Price is higher than the Estimated Purchase Price,
Purchaser shall pay the difference to Seller. If the Adjusted Purchase Price
is lower than the Estimated Purchase Price, Seller shall pay the difference
to Purchaser.

(f) Any amounts due under this _Section_ __ _ 3.2_ (other than pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(g)_) shall be paid by the owing Party to the other
Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated by the receiving Party on or before the fifth Business
Day after the Closing Statement becomes final and binding on the Parties.

(g) With respect to the Growth Capital Expansion Projects:

 

(i) Within 60 days after the completion of the Growth Capital Expansion
Projects, the completing Party shall deliver to the other Party a completion
statement setting forth, among others, details of itemized payments (the "
_Completion Statement_ "), certified by an officer of the completing Party.
Each Party shall have the right to audit the books and records of the other
Party regarding the costs and expenditures of the Growth Capital Expansion
Projects on reasonable notice and during normal business hours, and at the
auditing Partys sole cost, provided that such audit is initiated on or
before the 30th day after delivery of the Completion Statement. The Parties
will discuss and work together in good faith to agree on the aggregate amount
of costs and expenditures by Seller and Purchaser (and their Affiliates) with
respect to the Growth Capital Expansion Projects. If the Parties are unable to
agree on this amount within 30 days after the later of completion of the
audit, if applicable, or delivery of the Completion Statement, the Parties
shall resolve any remaining disagreement in accordance with the procedures
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.2(d)_.

 

(ii) If the aggregate amount of the costs and expenditures associated with
the Growth Capital Expansion Projects as determined in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(g)(i)_ is greater than or less than $37,600,000, the
Parties will share on a 50/50 basis any such additional costs or savings, as
the case may be. Any amounts due from one Party to the other Party under this
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(g)(ii)_ will be paid to the owing Party by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designed by the owed Party on the
later of (1) the fifth Business Day after the final determination thereof and
(2) the date contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 3.2(f)_.

 

(iii) Each Party agrees that it will make a good faith commercially
reasonable effort to progress the Growth Capital Expansion Projects in
accordance with (1) the estimated costs and timeline set forth in _Schedule_
_3.2(g)_ and (2) the original design, and will not make modifications except
as required by Law or as approved in writing by the other Party (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there are any material deviations in
the costs or timeline outlined within _Schedule_ _3.2(g)_ (1) prior to the
Effective Time, Seller will provide Purchaser written notice of such
deviations and (2) after the Effective Time, Purchaser will provide Seller
written notice of such deviations.

_Section_ __ _ 3.3_ _ _ _Closing_. The closing of the Transaction (the "
_Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Sellers counsel, Baker and
McKenzie LLP, 700 Louisiana, Suite 3000, Houston, Texas 77002, on the fifth
Business Day following satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the
Closing set forth in _Article_ _7_ (other than those to be satisfied at the
Closing), or at such other time and place as Purchaser and Seller may agree in

this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

applicable Law). If the Final Allocation is disputed by any Governmental
Authority, the Party receiving notice of such dispute will promptly notify the
other Party concerning the existence and resolution of such dispute and Seller
and Purchaser agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to defend
such Final Allocation in such dispute. In the event an adjustment to the

such amounts will be treated as having been paid to the applicable recipient
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any capital gains tax
(and any withholding tax related thereto) incurred in connection with the
Restructuring or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne by
Seller.

 the Transaction and to cooperate with each other in connection with the
foregoing, including to: (i) obtain any necessary waivers, Consents and
approvals from other parties to Acquired Contracts; (ii) obtain all
Governmental Authorizations that are required to be obtained under any Law and
that are material to the Cariflex Business or an Acquired Entity or the
Transaction; (iii) lift or rescind any injunction, restraining order or other
Judgment adversely affecting or delaying the ability of the Parties to
promptly consummate the Transaction; (iv) effect any necessary registrations
and filings including filings and submissions of information required by any

made promptly, but in no event later than 10 Business Days after the date

promptly make any other required submissions under the HSR Act or other such
laws; (v) use their best efforts to cooperate with one another in (1)
determining which, if any, other filings are required to be made under the
Antitrust Laws of other jurisdictions and which consents, approvals, permits
or authorizations are required to be obtained prior to consummation of the
Transaction and (2) timely making all such filings; and (vi) fulfill all
conditions to this Agreement. The Parties further covenant and agree, with
respect to any threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction or
other Judgment or Law that would adversely affect or delay the ability of the
Parties to consummate the Transaction, to use their respective best efforts
to prevent the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may be.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Purchaser will
use its best efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted with
respect to the Transaction under any antitrust, competition, merger control or
trade regulatory Laws (" _Antitrust Laws_ "). Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Purchaser will (i) use its best efforts to avoid the entry
of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Judgment that would restrain,
prevent or delay the consummation of the Transaction, including defending
through litigation on the merits and through any available appeals any claim
asserted in any court or other venue by any party, and (ii) take any and all
steps necessary to avoid (or eliminate) any impediment under any Antitrust
Laws that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Transaction so as to enable the consummation of such transactions to occur,
including proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting (by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise) the sale, divestiture or disposition
of such businesses, product lines or assets (or otherwise taking or committing
to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain or operate, any of the businesses, product lines or assets
of Purchaser or its Affiliates or Seller) as may be required in order to avoid
the pursuit or entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other Judgment in any proceeding, which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the Transaction,
but only to the extent taking any such steps and actions would not cause a
material adverse effect to Purchaser.

(c) The Parties will keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the Transaction and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining the requisite Governmental Authorizations,
including: (i) cooperating with the other Party in connection with filings
under any Antitrust Laws, including, with respect to the Party making a
filing, (1) providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing Party and
its advisors prior to filing (other than documents containing confidential
Business Information that will be shared only with outside legal counsel to
the non-filing Party) and (2) if requested, considering in good faith all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection with any
such filing; 

 



35

    

 (ii) furnishing to each other all information required for any application
or other filing to be made pursuant to any Antitrust Laws in connection with
the Transaction; (iii) promptly notifying the other of, and if in writing
furnishing the other with copies of, any communications from or with any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transaction; (iv) permitting the
other Party to review in advance and considering in good faith the views of
one another in connection with any proposed communication with any
Governmental Authority in connection with proceedings under or relating to any
Antitrust Laws; (v) not participating in any meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Authority in connection with proceedings under or relating to any
Antitrust Laws unless it consults with the other Party in advance, and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings or discussions; and
(vi) consulting and cooperating with one another in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either Party in connection
with Proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Laws. If either Party or
any Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or
documentary material from any such Governmental Authority with respect to the
Transaction, then such Party will use its best efforts to make, or cause to be
made, as expeditiously as possible and after consultation with the other
Party, an appropriate response in substantial compliance with such request.
Purchaser will advise Seller promptly in respect of any understandings,
undertakings or agreements (oral or written) which Purchaser proposes to make
or enter into with any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transaction, and will consider in good faith Sellers views regarding such
understanding, undertaking or agreement prior to making any proposal or offer.

 

(d) All filing fees with any Governmental Authority under applicable
Antitrust Laws, together with any other fees payable to a Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transaction, shall be borne by Purchaser.

(e) Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, obtain all Governmental
Authorizations from, give all notices to, and make all filings with, all
Governmental Authorities, and to obtain all other Consents from, and give all
other notices to, all other Persons, that are necessary or advisable in
connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transaction, including those listed in _Section_
__ _ 4.3_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Purchaser shall bear all costs
for any fees associated with such filings and Consents.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 6.4_ _ _ _No Financing Condition_. Purchaser expressly
acknowledges and agrees that Purchasers obligations under this Agreement are
not conditioned in any manner whatsoever upon Purchaser or its Affiliate
obtaining any financing and any failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement arising from the failure of Purchaser or its Affiliate to obtain
financing or the unavailability of such financing will be deemed to be knowing
and intentional for purposes of this Agreement, including _Section_ __ _
8.2_. To the extent that Purchaser has obtained any financing commitment,
Purchaser will keep Seller apprised of all developments or changes relating to
the financing contemplated by the financing commitments. In the event that the
financing commitments cease to be in full force and effect at any time or the
lenders party thereto indicate any unwillingness or inability to provide the
financing contemplated thereby, or for any reason Purchaser otherwise no
longer believes in good faith that it or any Affiliate will be able to obtain
the financing contemplated thereby, then Purchaser will immediately notify
Seller and use its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain replacement
financing arrangements or commitment letters as soon as possible.

 



36

    

_Section_ __ _ 6.5_ _ _ _Employment Matters_.

(a) Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) will
continue to employ with effect from the Closing Date (where employment
continues by operation of law), or, will offer employment to commence on the
Closing Date (where employment does not continue by operation of law) to, each
Business Employee listed in  _Section_ __ _ 4.14(a)_ of Seller Disclosure
Schedule in accordance with local law. Such continued employment or such offer
of employment, as the case may be, will be on terms and conditions, in
accordance with applicable Law, including total compensation (basic pay,
bonus target, benefits, stock awards, etc.), position, and responsibility,
that are equivalent to or better than the terms and conditions provided to
such Business Employee by Seller, its Affiliates, or the Acquired Entities
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Each Business Employee who (i) is
employed by an Acquired Entity, (ii) continues in employment with Purchaser or
its Affiliates by operation of law; or (iii) who takes up employment with
Purchaser or its Affiliates pursuant to an offer of employment made pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, will be referred to in this Agreement as a "
_Transferred Employee_." Seller shall be responsible for all severance or
termination costs and Liabilities related the termination of employment of any
Business Employee who does not become a Transferred Employee.

 

(b) For the two-year period commencing on the Closing Date (or such longer
period as may be required by applicable Law) (the " _Continuation Period_ "),
Purchaser will provide, and will cause the Acquired Entities to continue to
provide, the Transferred Employees with total compensation (basic pay, bonus
target, benefits, stock awards, etc.) that in the aggregate are substantially
equivalent to, and no less favorable than, those provided to such Transferred
Employees immediately prior to the Closing, and in all cases in accordance
with applicable Law. If any Transferred Employee is severed by Purchaser or
an Acquired Entity (other than for cause) within the two-year period after the
Closing, such severed employee shall receive severance in an amount, no less
than one month per year of service, severance plan in place, or
statutory requirement, whichever of the three is greater.

(c) Purchaser will maintain each welfare and benefit plan of an Acquired
Entity listed on _Schedule_ _6.5(c)_ from and after the Closing or provide
substantially equivalent (or same or better, if required by applicable Law)
benefits (including years of service) under other Purchaser-sponsored plans
for at least two years after the Closing, in all cases in accordance with
applicable Law and any Third Party employee representatives ( _e.g._ , works
councils, labor unions and similar groups).

 

(d) Effective as of the Closing Date, all Transferred Employees shall cease
active participation in all Company Employee Benefit Plans other than the
Assumed Benefit Plans.

(e) With respect to each Assumed Benefit Plan, including severance,
vacation and paid time-off plans, policies or practices, sponsored or
maintained by Purchaser or an Affiliate of Purchaser, Purchaser or such
Affiliate shall recognize, for all Transferred Employees, all service with
Seller, its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities) and their respective
predecessors, for

 



37

    

 all purposes (including eligibility, vesting, level of benefits, benefit
accrual, pre-existing condition limitations and early retirement
subsidies); provided that no service credit shall be granted to the extent
any duplication of benefits results.

(f) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide such information and cooperation as
Seller or its Affiliates may reasonably request with sufficient time in
advance to enable Seller and its Affiliates to meet any information or
consultation requirements to inform, consult with, or obtain approval from
Third Party employee representatives ( _e.g._ , works councils, labor unions
and similar groups) in connection with the Transaction.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended
to confer upon any Business Employee any benefits under any employee benefit
plan, fund or program including severance benefits or the right to employment
or continued employment with Purchaser or any Affiliate of Purchaser for any
period by reason of this Agreement. In addition, the provisions of this
Agreement, in particular this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, are for the sole benefit
of the Parties and their respective Affiliates and are not for the benefit of
any Third Parties.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ _ _ _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Each Party agrees not to issue any press release or make any other
public announcement relating to this Agreement or the agreements to be
executed and delivered in connection with this Agreement, without the prior
written approval of the other Party, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, except that each Party reserves the
right, without the other Partys prior consent, to make any public disclosure
it believes in good faith is required by applicable securities laws or
securities listing standards, including the filing of this Agreement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The Parties agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the Transaction shall be in the form
mutually agreed to by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) to the
extent the content of any press release or other public statement has been
made in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_, no separate approval shall
be required in respect of such content to the extent replicated in whole or in
part in any subsequent press release or other public statement, and (ii) the
Parties may make public statements in response to questions by the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences or financial
analysts conference calls, so long as any such statements are consistent with
the initial press release and other press releases and public statements made
jointly by the Parties or made by one Party in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 6.6_ and do not reveal material nonpublic information regarding this
Agreement or the Transaction.

(b) Seller agrees that Purchasers and Sellers obligations under that
certain Confidential Disclosure Agreement dated as of April 1, 2019 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") will terminate upon the Closing.

 

(c) Following the Closing, and except as specifically provided herein, each
Party shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and their respective
shareholders, owners, directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively,
the " _Related Persons_ ") to keep secret, retain in strictest confidence and
not distribute, disseminate or disclose any and all Confidential Information,
except to the Related Persons and contractors of such Party and its respective
Affiliates on a "need to know" basis in connection with this Agreement and the
performance 

 



38

    

 thereof, and such Party receiving Confidential Information pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.6(c)_ shall use, and shall cause its Related Persons to use,
such Confidential Information only for the specific purposes for which it was
disclosed to such Person; provided that disclosure of Confidential Information
by a Party or its Affiliates shall not violate this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(c)_
(i) to the extent that such Party (or its ultimate parent entity) deems it
necessary, pursuant to Law, regulation or stock exchange rule (in the
reasonable good faith judgment of such parent entity) to disclose such
information in connection with filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission or other Governmental Authority, (ii) to the extent that disclosure
is necessary in order to sustain a position taken for Tax purposes, or (iii)
in connection with any dispute between the Parties arising under this
Agreement. Except to the extent Confidential Information constitutes an
Acquired Asset, all Confidential Information disclosed in connection with or
pursuant to this Agreement shall remain the property of the Party whose
property it was prior to such disclosure. The Parties and their respective
Affiliates shall consult with each other on an ongoing basis with respect to
disclosures permitted under clause (i) of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(c)_.
The receiving Party shall be liable for any impermissible use or disclosure
of the Confidential Information of the other Party by it or its Related
Persons. To the extent that any Confidential Information disclosed to
Purchaser contains confidential information of Seller not concerning or
related to the Cariflex Business, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Related
Persons, to abide by the foregoing obligations in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(c)_
as if Purchaser (and its Related Persons) were Seller (and Sellers Related
Persons) with respect to such confidential information.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ _ _ _Disclosures Required by_ _Law_. Following the
Closing, in the event that a Party is legally required (by interrogatories,
discovery requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative
demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information of the
other Party, it is agreed that such Party prior to disclosure will provide
the other Party with prompt notice of such request so that the other Party may
seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive
its compliance with the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_. In the event
that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or that the other
Party grants a waiver hereunder, the Party required to furnish such
Confidential Information may furnish that portion (and only that portion) of
the Confidential Information which, in the opinion of such Partys counsel,
such Party is legally compelled to disclose, and such Party will exercise its
reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded any Confidential Information so furnished. The provisions of
_Sections_ _6.6(a)_ , _6.6(c)_ and _6.7_ shall survive the termination of this
Agreement for a period of two years.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ _ _ _Indemnification and Insurance_. Purchaser will
not, for a period of six years after the Closing, take or permit any action
to alter or impair any exculpatory or indemnification provisions now existing
in any organizational document of an Acquired Entity for the benefit of any
individual who served as a manager or an officer of Seller or an Acquired
Entity or an officer or director of at any time prior to the Closing (each an
" _Affiliate Indemnified Party_ "), except for any changes which may be
required to conform with changes in applicable Law and any changes which do
not affect the application of such provisions to acts or omissions of such
individuals prior to the Closing. Without limiting the generality of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.8_, the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ are
intended for the benefit of, and may be enforced by, each of the Affiliate
Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs.

 



39

    

_Section_ __ _ 6.9_ _ _ _Representation and Warranty Insurance_
_Policy_.

(a) The Parties will cooperate and use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Policy to be issued to Purchaser
Party on or prior to the Closing Date. Without limiting the foregoing,
Purchaser and Purchaser Party will each use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to obtain and to consummate
the issuance of the Policy on the terms and conditions described in the Binder
Agreement, including using its commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
maintain in effect the Binder Agreement, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Purchaser and Purchaser Party contained in the Binder
Agreement, including participation in the Insurers "bring down" diligence
review and the payment of the Policy Premium and any other amounts required as
a condition to the issuance of the Policy, (iii) upon the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions, consummate the issuance of the Policy on or prior
to the Closing Date, (iv) comply with its obligations under the Binder
Agreement, and (v) fully enforce its rights under the Binder Agreement in the
event of any failure by the Insurer to issue the Policy.

 

(b) At or prior to the Closing, Seller will reimburse or pay Purchaser for
50% of any and all Policy Premium required to be paid pursuant to the terms
of the Policy, up to the amount of $1,000,000.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 6.10_ _ _ _Restrictions on Seller Activities_.

 

(a) As an essential consideration for the obligations of Purchaser under
this Agreement, Seller, on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates (each,
a " _Seller Restricted Party_ "), hereby agrees and covenants that from the
Closing Date until the later of (i) the expiration of the Term (as defined in
the Supply Agreement) and the renewal period provided in Section 1.1 of the
Supply Agreement or (ii) the fifth anniversary of the expiry of the Term of
the Supply Agreement, no Seller Restricted Party shall, for whatever reason
and with or without cause, either individually or in partnership or jointly
or in conjunction with any Person or Persons (other than a holding of shares
listed on a publicly traded stock exchange or automated quotation system that
does not exceed 5% of the outstanding shares so listed), participate directly
or indirectly, anywhere in the world, in the Restricted Business, including
through use of the Application Technology licensed to Seller and its
Affiliates under the Technology License Agreement executed and delivered by
the Parties at the Closing. As used in this Agreement, " _Restricted
Business_ " means the manufacturing, development or sale of synthetic
alternatives to natural rubber latex for commercial and development
applications that involve isoprene rubber with a molecular weight of equal to
or higher than 1,500 kg/mol., isoprene rubber for latex applications, isoprene
rubber latex, SIS latex and butyl latex products; provided that neither the
sale by Sellers Affiliate of "Product" to Purchaser under the Supply
Agreement nor the sale by Seller or its Affiliate of wide-spec isoprene rubber
that is not purchased by Purchaser under the Supply Agreement is subject to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_.

 

(b) If Purchaser believes that any Seller Restricted Party has violated the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, Purchaser shall have the right to
seek injunctive or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction
against such Seller Restricted Party. Seller, on its own behalf and on behalf
of each Seller Restricted Party, acknowledges that money damages alone shall
not adequately compensate Purchaser in the event of a breach of the covenants
of this _Section_ __ _ 6.10_. Therefore, Seller, on its own behalf and on
behalf of each Seller Restricted Party, agrees that in addition to

 



40

    

 all remedies available at law, in equity or under this Agreement and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Purchaser shall be entitled
to seek injunctive or equitable relief for the enforcement of this covenant.

(c) From the Closing Date until the fifth anniversary of the Effective
Time, Seller and its Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly, hire,
solicit, knowingly induce, attempt to solicit or induce, or otherwise
knowingly encourage any Transferred Employee to terminate or otherwise
adversely alter his or her employment or engagement with Purchaser or its
Affiliate or enter into an employment, consulting, independent contractor or
similar relationship with any such Person; provided, however, the foregoing
shall not preclude Seller or its Affiliate from making general or public
solicitations not targeted at the Transferred Employees.

(d) Seller, on its own behalf and on behalf of each Seller Restricted
Party, agrees that the covenants in this Section 6.10 are reasonable with
respect to their duration, scope and geographical area. If any provision of
this Section 6.10 is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable by applicable
Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, and the remainder of such
provision or the remaining provisions of this Section 6.10 shall remain valid,
legal and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by Law.

_Section_ __ _ 6.11_ _ _ _Restrictions on Purchaser Activities_.

(a) As an essential consideration for the obligations of Seller under this
Agreement, Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates (each, a
" _Purchaser Restricted Party_ "), hereby agrees and covenants that from the
Closing Date until the fifth anniversary of the Effective Time, no Purchaser
Restricted Party shall, for whatever reason and with or without cause, either
individually or in partnership or jointly or in conjunction with other
Purchaser Restricted Party, compete directly or indirectly, anywhere in the
world, with the Kraton Retained Business using the Acquired Assets. As used
in this Agreement, " _Kraton Retained Business_ " means the manufacture,
development and sale of unhydrogenated styrenic block co-polymers
and hydrogenated styrenic block copolymers products and pine chemicals and
derivatives thereof, all in non-latex form, anywhere in the world.

 

(b) If Seller believes that any Purchaser Restricted Party has violated the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_, Seller shall have the right to
seek injunctive or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction
against such Purchaser Restricted Party. Purchaser, on its own behalf and on
behalf of each Purchaser Restricted Party, acknowledges that money damages
alone shall not adequately compensate Seller in the event of a breach of the
covenants of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_. Therefore, Purchaser, on its own
behalf and on behalf of each Purchaser Restricted Party, agrees that in
addition to all remedies available at law, in equity or under this Agreement
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Seller shall be entitled
to seek injunctive or equitable relief for the enforcement of this covenant.

(c) From the Closing Date until the fifth anniversary of the Effective
Time, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly, hire,
solicit, knowingly induce, attempt to solicit or induce, or otherwise
knowingly encourage any employees of Seller or its Affiliates with whom
Purchaser or its Affiliates came into contact with in connection with the
Transaction or performance of any Transaction Agreement, to terminate or
otherwise adversely alter his or her

 



41

    

 employment or engagement with Seller or its Affiliates or enter into an
employment, consulting, independent contractor or similar relationship with
any such Person, provided, however, the foregoing shall not preclude
Purchaser from making general or public solicitations not targeted at Sellers
employees.

 

(d) Purchaser, on its own behalf and on behalf of each Purchaser Restricted
Party, agrees that the covenants in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ are
reasonable with respect to their duration, scope and geographical area. If any
provision of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ is held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable by applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to
the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, and the
remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this _Section_ __ _
6.11_ shall remain valid, legal and enforceable to the maximum extent
permitted by Law.

_Section_ __ _ 6.12_ _ _ _No Negotiation_. During the period from the
date of this Agreement through the Closing or the earlier termination of this
Agreement, Seller will refrain, and will cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to refrain from taking any action (a) to solicit or initiate
the submission of any proposal or indication of interest from any Person
(other than Purchaser) with respect to an acquisition of all or any part of
the Cariflex Business (an " _Alternative Proposal_ "), (b) to intentionally
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any information with respect to, or that may reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Alternative Proposal (or any proposal or indication of
interest relating thereto) with any Person (other than Purchaser) or (c) to
authorize, engage in, or enter into any agreement or understanding with
respect to an Alternative Proposal with any Person (other than with
Purchaser). In the event that any of Seller or its Affiliates or
Representatives receives a written offer for an Alternative Proposal, Seller
shall within two Business Days notify Purchaser of such an offer and the terms
thereof and shall not negotiate or discuss with the offeror or otherwise
pursue said offer in any manner. Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
and Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions, communications or negotiations with any Person (other
than Purchaser) conducted heretofore with respect to the sale of the Cariflex
Business.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ _ _ _Post-Closing Cooperation, Retained
Litigation_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall, at Sellers sole cost and
expense, (a) provide such access to its personnel, records and facilities and
(b) direct its employees to provide reasonable cooperation to Seller or its
Affiliate or Representatives, in each case as is reasonably requested during
normal business hours by Seller or its Affiliate or Representatives in order
to aid Seller or its Affiliate or Representatives in continuing to pursue to
final resolution (as determined by Seller in its sole discretion) the Retained
Litigation; provided that such access and cooperation do not unreasonably
interfere with the operation of the Cariflex Business or other business of
Purchaser.

(b) From and after the Closing, (i) as required by applicable Law, (ii) in
response to the request or at the direction of a Governmental Authority, or
(iii) for the preparation of Tax Returns or other documents related to Tax
matters of Purchaser and its Affiliates, Seller shall afford, or to cause to
be afforded, to Purchaser and its Representatives reasonable access to, upon
reasonable notice during normal business hours, the officers, business,
financial information, Tax Returns and other data of Seller and its
Affiliates that were primarily related to the Cariflex

 



42

    

 Business prior to the Closing (the " _Business Information_ "). Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, preserve and keep the Business
Information for a period of seven years from the Closing Date.

_Section_ __ _ 6.14_ _ _ _Employee-Related Authorizations_. 

(a) To enable Seller to comply with any obligations it may have under any
Law or any agreement to inform and/or consult with the works councils,
unions or other Third Party employee representative bodies of any Transferred
Employee or Acquired Entity concerning the transactions contemplated hereby,
the Parties agree that Seller and Purchaser shall have no obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby until such time as such
obligations have been completed.

 

(b) Seller agrees to comply with all requirements to inform and/or consult
the works councils and any other employee representative body prior to
Closing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and to
ensure that the relevant Third Party employee representatives or employees
right of information and/or consultation shall be given the fullest effect
provided by Law or agreement, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Seller
shall not be deemed to have made any final decision to proceed with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby until such time as Seller
has had the opportunity to take each affected relevant Third Party employee
representatives or employees opinion or comments into consideration.

_Section_ __ _ 6.15_ _ _ _Further Assurances_. Subject to the other
express provisions of this Agreement, upon the reasonable request of either
Party, the other Party will (a) furnish to the requesting Party any additional
information, (b) execute and deliver, at its own reasonable expense, any

period up to one year after the Closing, Purchaser may use Sellers marks
containing the word "Kraton" in relation to the conduct of the Cariflex

efforts to replace any mark containing the word "Kraton" on (i) any Product
packaging as promptly as practicable after the Closing and in any event within
one year after the Closing Date, and (ii) any signage or other assets located
on or about the Facility within six months after the Closing Date.

ARTICLE 7

 

CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO OBLIGATION TO CLOSE

 

 _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ _ _ _Conditions to the Obligation of_ _Purchaser_.
The obligation of Purchaser to consummate the Transaction is subject to the
satisfaction or waiver, on or before the Closing Date, of each of the
following conditions:

 

(a) _Accuracy of Representations and Warranties_. The representations and
warranties of Seller in this Agreement must have been true and correct in all
material respects as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date
(and except to the extent any representation or warranty of Seller speaks as
of any other specific date, in which case such representation or warranty
must have been true and correct in all material respects as of such date),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true
and correct would not, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
a Material Adverse Condition to Purchaser. " _Material Adverse Condition_ "
means the aggregate Losses in the amount equal to 10% of the Base Purchase

TERMINATION

 

 _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ _ _ _Termination Events_. This Agreement may, by
written notice given before or at the Closing, be terminated:

(a) by mutual consent of Purchaser and Seller;

 

(b) by Purchaser (so long as Purchaser is not then in material breach of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement) if there has been a breach of any of Sellers representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which would
result in the failure of a condition set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)_, and which breach has not been cured or cannot be
cured within 30 days after the notice of the breach from Purchaser;

 



45

    

(c) by Seller (so long as Seller is not then in material breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement) if there has been a breach of any of Purchasers representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which would
result in the failure of a condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)_, and which breach has not been cured or cannot be
cured within 30 days after the notice of breach from Seller;

 

(d) by either Purchaser or Seller if any Governmental Authority has issued
a nonappealable final Judgment or taken any other nonappealable final action,
in each case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Transaction; or

 

(e) by either Seller or Purchaser if the Closing has not occurred on or
before June 30, 2020 (the " _Outside Date_ ") (other than through the failure
of the Party seeking such termination to comply fully with its obligations
under this Agreement); provided that if the Closing has not occurred due
to non-satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(d)_,
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_, _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(g)_,
the Outside Date shall be automatically extended to December 31, 2020.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ _ _ _Effect of Termination_. Each Partys rights of
termination under _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ are in addition to any other rights it
may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of such rights of
termination is not an election of remedies. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_, this Agreement and all rights and
obligations of the Parties under this Agreement automatically end without
Liability against any Party or its Affiliates, except that (a) _ Section_ __
_ 4.25_ ( _Brokers or Finders_ ), _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ ( _Confidentiality_ ),
this ___Section_ __ _ 8.2_, _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ ( _Termination Fees_ ), and
_Article_ _11_ ( _General Provisions_ ) (except for _Section_ __ _ 10.11_ (
_Specific Performance_ )) will remain in full force and survive any
termination of this Agreement, and (b) if this Agreement is terminated by a
Party because of the breach of this Agreement by the other Party or because
one or more of the conditions to the terminating Partys obligations under
this Agreement is not satisfied as a result of the other Partys failure to
comply with its obligations under this Agreement, the terminating Partys
right to pursue all legal and contractual remedies will survive such
termination unimpaired. If this Agreement is terminated (other than
because of a breach of this Agreement by Seller), Purchaser will immediately
return or destroy all Confidential Information in its or its Affiliates or
their Representatives possession, and will promptly certify that it has
returned and/or destroyed all Confidential Information.

_Section_ __ _ 8.3_ _ _ _Termination Fee_. The Parties hereby
acknowledge and agree that the extent of damages to Seller or Purchaser from
the termination of this Agreement by any reason would be impossible or
extremely impractical to ascertain and that the amounts specified in this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.3_ are a fair and reasonable estimate of the damages
suffered by Seller or Purchaser. In the event that the Agreement is terminated
by Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_, Purchaser shall pay to Seller
the amount equal to 5% of the Base Purchase Price (the " _Reverse Termination
Fee_ ") within two Business Days following such termination by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account specified by Seller in writing
to Purchaser. The Reverse Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Seller and its Affiliates with respect to such termination,
including any Losses arising out of or related to the breach or breaches
giving rise to such termination. In the event that the Agreement is
terminated by Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.1(b), Seller shall pay to
Purchaser the amount equal to 5% of the Base Purchase Price (the "
_Termination Fee_ ") within two Business Days following such termination by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to

 



46

    

 an account specified by Purchaser in writing to Seller. The Termination Fee
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser and its Affiliates with
respect to such termination, including any Losses arising out of or related
to the breach or breaches giving rise to such termination; provided that
Purchaser may seek specific performance and other equitable remedies in lieu
of receiving the Termination Fee. Moreover, if this Agreement is terminated
and such termination results in payment of the Reverse Termination Fee by
Purchaser in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_, Purchaser shall also
reimburse Seller for any and all Remodel Costs incurred by Seller.

Party in control of the defense or settlement of any such Tax Contest may not
settle such Tax Contest in any manner which would adversely affect the other

be borne by the Party that is legally liable to bear under the applicable
local Tax Law, provided that in case no payer is designated by such local Tax

primarily or customarily responsible under the applicable local law for
filing such Tax Returns, and such party will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other party at least 10 days prior
to the due date for such Tax Returns. If, pursuant to the immediately

Transfer Taxes, the other Party hereto shall pay such Party that portion of
the Transfer Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return for which it
is responsible hereunder no later than five days after receiving a copy of
such Tax Return.

intangible property Taxes and other similar periodic or ad valorem Taxes, be
deemed to be equal to the amount of all such Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in such Straddle Period through and including the Closing Date,
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period; provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date
and the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of
days in each period.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ _ _ _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. (a) Any amount
paid pursuant to  _Article_ _2_ or _Article_ _10_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

 



48

    

_Section_ __ _ 9.6_ _ _ _Purchaser s Claiming, Receiving, or Using of
Refunds, Overpayments and Prepayments_. If, after the Closing, Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates (a) receives any refund (whether by payment, offset, or
credit (in lieu of a refund), including any Tax credits arising from or
relating to the Restructuring) or (b) utilizes the benefit of any overpayment
of Taxes (including any overpayment that results in a credit in lieu of a
refund) that, in each case of provisions (a) and (b) above, relates to Taxes
paid by Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect to the Pre-Closing Period
and which was not reflected in the calculation of the Working Capital of the
Cariflex Business (each, a " _Tax Refund_ "), Purchaser shall transfer, or
cause to be transferred, to Seller the entire amount of the Tax Refund
(including any interest paid thereon by a Governmental Authority, but less any
expenses or costs of Purchaser or its Affiliates in receiving or obtaining
such Tax Refund) received or utilized by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
within 30 days after the Tax Refund is received or utilized. Purchaser shall
notify Seller within 15 days following the discovery of a right to claim any
such Tax Refund and the receipt of any such refund or utilization of any such
overpayment. Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to claim any such
refund as soon as possible and to furnish to Seller all information,
records and assistance necessary to verify the amount of the Tax Refund. At
Sellers request and expense, Purchaser will undertake commercially reasonable
efforts to claim any Tax Refund.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 9.7_ _ _ _Post-Closing Actions That Affect Seller_ __ _s
Liability for Taxes_. Neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates shall take any
action (including amending any Tax Return or engaging in any non-ordinary
course of business transaction) on or after the Closing that could increase
Sellers (or Sellers Affiliates) liability for Taxes (including any
liability of Seller to indemnify Purchaser for Taxes under this Agreement),
without the prior written consent of Seller.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 9.8_ _ _ _Assistance and Cooperation_. The Parties agree

relevant correspondence received by such Party or its Affiliates from any
taxing authority in connection with any Taxes for which such other Party may
have an indemnification obligation under this Agreement; and

 



49

    

(e) each Party shall retain (and shall cause its Affiliates to retain) all
Tax Returns and books and records with respect to Taxes relating to any
taxable period beginning on or before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations of the relevant taxable period.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ _ _ _Tax Elections_. (a) With respect to any
Acquired Entity, Purchaser shall not (a) cause an election pursuant to

their respective directors, officers, equity owners, employees, agents,
consultants and other advisors and representatives (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against, and will pay and
reimburse them for, any and all Losses incurred or suffered by Purchaser
Indemnified Parties directly or indirectly arising out of, relating to or
resulting from any of the following:

 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered by or on behalf

50

    

_Section_ __ _ 10.3_ _ _ _Claim Procedure_. 

(a) A Party that seeks indemnity under this _Article_ _10_ (an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") will give written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the
Party from whom indemnification is sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
containing (i) a description and, if known, the estimated amount of any Losses
incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party, and
(ii) a reasonable explanation of the basis for the Claim Notice to the extent
of the facts then known by the Indemnified Party.

 

(b) Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party
will deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response to such Claim
Notice. If the Indemnifying Party fails to so respond within 30 days after
delivery of the Claim Notice, then the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to
have irrevocably accepted the Claim Notice and agreed to pay the Losses at
issue in the Claim Notice.

(c) If, within 30 days after delivery of the Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party delivers a written notice disputing the Indemnified
Partys entitlement to indemnification for the Losses described in the Claim
Notice, then the dispute may be resolved by any legally available means
consistent with the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 11.9_.

(d) Any indemnification payment pursuant to this _Article_ _10_  will be
effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the Indemnifying
Party to an account designated by the Indemnified Party, and will be made
within five Business Days after the date on which (i) the amount of such
payments are determined by mutual agreement of the Parties, (ii) the amount
of such payments are determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ if a
written response has not been timely delivered in accordance with
subsection (b) of this _Section_ __ _ 10.3_, or (iii) both such amount and
the Indemnifying Partys obligation to pay such amount have been finally
determined in accordance with the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 11.9_ if a
written response has been timely delivered in accordance with subsection (b)
of this _Section_ __ _ 10.3_.

 

(e) With respect to claims related to Tax matters, to the extent any claim
procedure governed by this  _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ conflicts with a claim
procedure governed by _Article_ _9_ , then _Article_ _9_ shall control.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 10.4_ _ _ _Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) If the Indemnified Party seeks indemnity under this _Article_ _10_ in
response to a claim or Proceeding by another Person not a party to this
Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), then the Indemnified Party will give a
Claim Notice to the Indemnifying Party within 10 days after the Indemnified
Party has received notice or otherwise learns of the assertion of such Third
Party Claim and will include in the Claim Notice (i) the facts constituting
the basis for such Third Party Claim and the amount of the damages claimed by
the other Person, in each case to the extent known to the Indemnified Party,
accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation submitted by such Third
Party (to the extent then in the possession of the Indemnified Party), and
(ii) the assertion of the claim or the notice of the commencement of
any Proceeding relating to such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that no
delay or deficiency on the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the
Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party of any Liability under
this Agreement except to the extent such delay or deficiency prejudices or
otherwise materially adversely affects the rights of the Indemnifying Party
with respect thereto.

 



51

    

(b) In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will be
entitled, at its own expense, to participate in the defense thereof and, if it
so chooses, to assume at any time control of the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party by giving to the Indemnified
Party written notice of its intention to assume control of the defense of
such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel at
its own expense.

 

(c) The Indemnifying Party will not agree to any settlement of, or Consent
to the entry of any Judgment (other than a Judgment of dismissal on the
merits without costs) arising from, any such Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the
Consent of the Indemnified Party will not be required if the Indemnifying
Party agrees in writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement
or any Judgment and such settlement or Judgment includes a full, complete and
unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from further Liability.
The Indemnified Party will not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of
any Judgment (other than a Judgment of dismissal on the merits without costs)
arising from, any such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party.

_Section_ __ _ 10.5_ _ _ _Environmental Matters_. Seller shall have no
obligation under _Section_ __ _ 10.1(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.1(c)_ with
respect to any Retained Environmental Liabilities, to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Purchaser from and against any Losses arising in
connection therewith to the extent that such Losses result from (i) a change
in the use of any portion or parcel of any Real Property from industrial use
or commercial use to residential use or (ii) an investigation of environmental
conditions on any Real Property involving invasive testing or sampling
procedures, such as soil and groundwater sampling, voluntarily undertaken by
or for Purchaser. For the avoidance of doubt, such voluntary investigations
providing limitations on Sellers obligations as provided above shall not
include any such investigation (A) required under any applicable Environmental
Law in effect, (B) required by an order of any Governmental Authority issued
under an Environmental Law (provided such order has not been solicited by, or
on behalf of, Purchaser or resulted from a voluntary investigation as provided
above), or (C) conducted in connection with Purchasers good faith need to
conduct subsurface maintenance, repair and renovation activities,
construction or demolition on any Real Property. Sellers obligations to
indemnify Purchaser as provided in this _Section_ __ _ 10.5_ shall be limited
to the cost of any such response action or remediation conducted in a
reasonable and cost effective manner and based upon industrial standards
applicable to the current use of the Real Property as determined by
Environmental Laws, and, to the extent applicable to that particular site,
must include the use of risk-based cleanup standards, natural attenuation,
deed restrictions and other institutional controls available under
Environmental Laws so long as such standards, restrictions and controls will
not unreasonably interfere with Purchasers operation of or current use of
the Real Property.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 10.6_ _ _ _Survival_. All representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall expire at the Closing. All covenants of the
Parties shall expire at the Closing unless they contain an express survival
period, in which case such covenant will expire on the date specified therein
plus 60

 



52

    

 days thereafter. The obligation of Seller to indemnify Purchaser for Losses
attributable to any Retained Environmental Liabilities pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 10.1(c)_ shall survive for 60 months following the Closing Date. The
obligation of Seller to indemnify Purchaser for Losses attributable to Seller
Taxes shall survive until 30 days after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations relative thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
claims for indemnification asserted in good faith with reasonable specificity
(to the extent known at such time) and in writing by notice before the
expiration of the applicable survival period will not thereafter be barred by
the expiration of the relevant representation or warranty and such claims will
survive until finally resolved.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 10.7_ _ _ _Insurance Proceeds and Other Payments_. The
amount of any and all Losses for which indemnification is provided pursuant
to this _Article_ _10_ will be net of (a) any amounts of any insurance
proceeds (including under the Policy), indemnification payments (other than
from the Indemnifying Party) and other Third Party recoveries actually
receivable by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses or any of the
circumstances giving rise thereto. In connection therewith, if, at any time
following payment in full by the Indemnifying Party of any amounts of Losses
due under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party receives any insurance
proceeds, indemnification payments or other Third Party recoveries relating to
the circumstances giving rise to such Losses, the Indemnified Party
will promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party the value of such proceeds,
payments or recoveries in an amount not to exceed the amount of the
corresponding indemnification payment made by the Indemnifying Party.
Purchaser will use (and will cause its Affiliates to use) commercially
reasonable efforts to collect the proceeds of any available insurance
(including the Policy), indemnification agreements, contracts and similar
rights and to seek recovery under all applicable insurance
policies, indemnification agreements, contracts and similar rights for all
Losses (including a Loss directly or indirectly arising out of, relating to or
resulting from a Seller Tax) to the extent such Losses are covered by any
insurance policy, indemnification agreement, contract or similar right of
Purchaser, which would have the effect of reducing any Losses (in which case
the net proceeds thereof will reduce the Losses). For the avoidance of doubt,
any Losses arising out of a breach of Sellers representations and warranties
will be asserted first against the Policy to the extent covered by the Policy
prior to asserting any Claim for a Loss against Seller arising out of or
related to a Retained Liability. In the event that an insurance or other
recovery is made by any Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses
for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal
to the aggregate amount of the recovery will be made promptly to Seller. 

_Section_ __ _ 10.8_ _ _ _Mitigation_. The Indemnified Party will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses with respect to which
it may be entitled to seek indemnification pursuant to this Agreement,
including diligently pursuing and attempting to recover all insurance proceeds
and all other recoveries under each applicable insurance policy (including
the Policy).

_Section_ __ _ 10.9_ _ _ _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Closing,
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any
breach of any covenant under this Agreement (other than claims or causes of
action arising from fraud or willful misconduct) will be pursuant to the
indemnification obligations set forth in this _Article_ _10_. The sole and
exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to breaches

 (including breaches of representations and warranties that would be covered
by the Policy but for the exhaustion or impairment of that Policys limits of
liability), except for any such breach arising or resulted from fraud or
willful misconduct by Seller. Except to the extent either Party has asserted a
claim for indemnification by giving a Claim Notice in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 10.3_ or  _Section_ __ _ 10.4_ prior to the expiration of
the applicable survival period set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.6_, either
Party will have no remedy against the other Party for any breach of any
provision of this Agreement. To the extent anything from this _Section_ __ _
10.9_ shall conflict with any other provision of this Agreement, the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.9_ shall prevail. Each of Seller and
Purchaser hereby waive any and all other remedies (other than claims or
causes of action arising from fraud or willful misconduct) that may be
available at law or equity for any breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein
will limit the right of any Party to seek injunctive or equitable relief for
any breach or threatened breach of any covenant in this Agreement. For
purposes of determining (i) whether the breach of a representation, warranty
or covenant exists for purposes of this _Article_ _10_ , and (ii) the amount
of Losses sustained or suffered by a Purchaser Indemnified Party, all
"materiality," "Material Adverse Effect," and similar qualifications shall be
disregarded in the representations, warranties and covenants made by Seller in
this Agreement.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 10.10_ _ _ _Retention_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, in the event that a claim is made by a Purchaser Indemnified
Party under the Policy and is finally determined by the Insurer (pursuant to
any dispute resolution mechanism in the Binder Agreement) to be valid and
payable under the Policy, Seller shall pay 50% of such claim amount to be
retained by Purchaser or Purchaser Party under the Policy to the Purchaser
Indemnified Party within 10 Business Days after the delivery of a notice by
Purchaser to Seller of such determination by the Insurer; provided that
Sellers obligation to pay under this _Section_ __ _ 10.10_ shall cease when
the aggregate amount of the claims finally determined by the Insurer to be
valid and payable exceeds the then applicable retention amount under the
Policy and the Insurer begins payment to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
under the Policy.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 10.11_ _ _ _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Parties accordingly agree that, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity, the Parties are entitled to injunctive or
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and otherwise to
enforce specifically the provisions of this Agreement. Each Party expressly
waives any requirement that any other Party obtain any bond or provide any
indemnity in connection with any action seeking injunctive or equitable relief
or specific enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement. Each
Party irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware with respect to all actions
and Proceedings under this _Section_ __ _ 10.11_.

 

 _Section_ __ _ 10.12_ _ _ _Express Negligence Notice_. SUBJECT TO THE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS HEREOF, THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT
SHALL BE APPLICABLE WHETHER OR NOT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY OF THE
PERSON ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION HEREUNDER IS ALLEGED OR PROVEN.

 



54

    

_Section_ __ _ 10.13_ _ _ _Subrogation_. If Purchaser or any Purchaser
Indemnified Party is indemnified for any Losses pursuant to this Agreement
with respect to any claim by a Person not a party to this Agreement, then
Seller will be subrogated to all rights and remedies of Purchaser or
the Purchaser Indemnified Party against such Third Party, and Purchaser will,
and will cause each Purchaser Indemnified Party to, cooperate with and assist
Seller in asserting all such rights and remedies against such Third Party.
Purchaser agrees that the Policy shall provide that there shall be no
subrogation against Seller for any claims made by Purchaser or any Purchaser
Indemnified Party under the Policy.

Affiliate prior to Closing without the prior written consent of Seller;
provided that Purchaser shall remain obligated for the performance of all
obligations of Purchaser under this Agreement as the primary obligor. Nothing
expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any
