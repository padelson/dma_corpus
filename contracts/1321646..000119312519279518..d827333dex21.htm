any amounts of Losses due under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party receives any insurance proceeds, indemnification payments or other Third Party recoveries relating to the circumstances giving rise to such Losses, the Indemnified Party will
promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party the value of such proceeds, payments or recoveries in an amount not to exceed the amount of the corresponding indemnification payment made by the Indemnifying Party. Purchaser will use (and will cause its
Affiliates to use) commercially reasonable efforts to collect the proceeds of any available insurance (including the Policy), indemnification agreements, contracts and similar rights and to seek recovery under all applicable insurance policies,
indemnification agreements, contracts and similar rights for all Losses (including a Loss directly or indirectly arising out of, relating to or resulting from a Seller Tax) to the extent such Losses are covered by any insurance policy,
indemnification agreement, contract or similar right of Purchaser, which would have the effect of reducing any Losses (in which case the net proceeds thereof will reduce the Losses). For the avoidance of doubt, any Losses arising out of a breach of
Seller&#146;s representations and warranties will be asserted first against the Policy to the extent covered by the Policy prior to asserting any Claim for a Loss against Seller arising out of or related to a Retained Liability. In the event that an
insurance or other recovery is made by any Purchaser Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery will be made promptly to Seller.
