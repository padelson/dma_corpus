clauses _(i)_ and _(ii)_ and, as of the date of such replacement, such
Seller or any its Affiliates reasonably determines in good faith that the
performance of the Company is unacceptable or deficient in a more than
immaterial __ manner (taking into account standards that a reasonable investor
in CMBS securitizations would consider appropriate as well as applicable facts
and circumstances, _it_ _being_ _understood_ and _agreed_ that the level of
fees the Company charges with respect to such Covered PSA shall not be taken
into account in making any such determination unless such Seller or Affiliate
has discussed its concern about such fees with the Company before it replaces
the Company as special servicer under such Covered PSA); and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that (i) the maximum aggregate amount any Seller shall be required
to pay under this _Section 2.8(a)_ is $50,000,000; (ii) no Seller shall have
any liability under this _Section 2.8(a)_ unless the aggregate amount
otherwise payable by such Seller under this _Section 2.8(a)_ exceeds
$7,500,000; and (iii) if the aggregate amount otherwise payable by such Seller
under this _Section 2.8(a)_ exceeds $7,500,000, such Seller shall be required
to pay all amounts payable under this _Section 2.8(a)_ (including such
initial $7,500,000) up to an aggregate amount of $50,000,000; _it_ _being_
_understood_ that each Sellers liability under this _Section 2.8(a)_ shall
be several and not joint.

 



 

(b) Solely for purposes of _Section 2.8(a)_ (i) the term "Affiliate", with
respect to any Seller, (x) means any entity controlled by, controlling or
under common control with such Seller and (y) shall be deemed to exclude any
portfolio company in which such Seller or any of its Affiliates invests,
directly or indirectly, and with respect to Oaktree, shall be deemed to
further exclude Oaktree PPIP Fund, L.P.; (ii) the term "control" means the
ability to exercise majority voting power or to appoint a majority of the
board of directors (or similar governing body) of an entity, in each case,
through equity ownership, contract or otherwise; (iii) the phrase
"compensation or benefit" with respect to any Seller or any of its Affiliates
shall be deemed to exclude any compensation or benefit received by such Seller
or any of its Affiliates in its capacity as a holder of the relevant
securities ( _pro rata_ with other holders of such securities) to the extent
such holder reasonably believes the relevant action is in the best interests
of the holders of such securities generally, but only if such Seller or
Affiliate has discussed its concern about the fees with the Company before it
replaces the Company as special servicer under the applicable Covered PSA;
(iv) the term "Company" means the Company and its Affiliates (without giving
effect to clause _(i)_ of this _Section 2.8(b)_); and (v) "competitor", with
respect to

 



       
 

 



 

the Company, shall mean any entity primarily engaged in commercial mortgage
special servicing activities in the U.S.

 



 

(c) For all Tax purposes, the parties agree to treat any payment pursuant to a
Clawback Event as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_**

 



 

The Company represents and warrants as of the date of this Agreement and as of
the Closing Date (except for the representations and warranties that by their
terms refer to a specific date, which representations and warranties shall be
made solely as of the specified date) to Purchaser that the statements
contained in this _ARTICLE III_ are correct and complete, except as set forth
in the disclosure schedule set forth as _Exhibit H_ hereto (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ ") accompanying this Agreement with reference to the
applicable section of this _ARTICLE III_ to which the disclosures on such
schedule relate; _it_ _being_ _understood_ that the listing or setting forth
of an item in one section of the Company Disclosure Schedule pertaining to the
representations and warranties shall be deemed to be a listing or setting
forth in another section or sections of the Company Disclosure Schedule
pertaining to the representations and warranties if such disclosure is
reasonably apparent on its face to be applicable to such other section or
sections. Each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement contained
herein shall have independent significance. Accordingly, if any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein is breached,
the fact that there exists another representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) shall not detract from or mitigate the breach of the
first representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The Company also
represents that, to its Knowledge, the statements with respect to Material
Subsidiaries or Subsidiaries set forth in Sections _3.1_ , _3.3_ , _3.6_ ,
_3.8_ , _3.10_ , _3.12_ , _3.13_ , _3.17_ and _3.18_ are true and correct with

sentence).

as it is now being conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified and authorized to do business and is in good standing (or in active
status) under the Laws of each jurisdiction in which it owns or leases real
property and each other jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or
the ownership of its properties requires such qualification or authorization,

aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The Company has made available to Purchaser prior to the date hereof true
and complete copies of the Organizational Documents of the Company, each of
its Material

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries and each Non-Controlled JV Entity. The membership register, stock
certificate and transfer books and the minute books of the Company and each of
its Material Subsidiaries, all of which have been made available to Purchaser
before the date hereof, are true and complete in all material respects. At the
Closing, all such books, other than those with respect to Non-Controlled JV
Entities, will be in the possession of the Company or the applicable Material
Subsidiary.

 



 

3.2 _Authorization_. The Company has all requisite limited liability company
power and authority and has taken all limited liability company or similar
action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations

other similar Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights
generally, and to the extent that the remedy of specific performance and
injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable
defenses and to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding
therefor may be brought (collectively, the " _Bankruptcy and Equity
Limitation_ ").

 



 

3.3 _No Violation_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.3_ (Part A) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or, when executed, the other Transaction Documents to which the
Company is a party, by the Company, the performance by the Company of its

result in a breach of any provision of the Organizational Documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (b) conflict with or result in a breach
of, or constitute a default (with or without due notice or lapse of time or
both) or result in or give any Person any right of termination, cancellation,

Agreement and the other Transaction Documents other than (i) consents and
approvals of or filings or registrations with the Federal Trade Commission and
the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice pursuant to
the HSR Act and (ii) the consents, approvals, filings and registrations
required under any applicable foreign antitrust or competition Laws (the "
_Other Required Competition Approvals_ ") relating to the European Union, the
United Kingdom, Germany or any other member state of the European Union.

 



 

3.5 _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) _Section 3.5(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct
and complete description of the following: (i) all the issued and outstanding
Units of the Company as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) the record
owners of the Units of the Company as of the date of this Agreement. Except as
set forth on _Section 3.5(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are
no other equity interests of the Company outstanding, issued or reserved for
issuance.

 



 

(b) The Acquired Units (i) constitute 100% of the issued and outstanding Units
of the Company; (ii) have been duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid
(to the extent required under the Company LLC Agreement) and are nonassessable
(except as such nonassessability may be affected by Section 18-607 of the
Delaware LLC Act); (iii) were not issued in violation of any preemptive
rights, rights of first refusal, purchase option, call option, subscription
right or other similar rights of any Person and (iv) have been issued in
compliance with applicable federal and state securities Laws.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 3.5(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no preemptive rights or other outstanding rights, options,
warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights,
repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, subscription agreements,
commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue or sell any equity interests or any securities or
obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any
Person (other than the Company or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries) a
right to subscribe for or acquire, any equity interests in the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights
are authorized, issued or outstanding. The 2010 Equity Plan is the only
Benefit Plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under which any equity
interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been issued or are
issuable. Each Unit which may be issued pursuant to the 2010 Equity Plan has
been duly authorized and, when issued pursuant to the terms thereof, will be
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights
(other than as expressly provided by the Company LLC Agreement). To the extent
that the Company has agreed to grant an option to purchase Units under the
2010 Equity Plan to a Bonus Plan Participant, if a Sale Transaction (as
defined in the Bonus Plan) closes before the Bonus Plan terminates pursuant to
its terms, any such rights to the option held by the Bonus Plan Participant
shall thereupon terminate.

 



 

(d) _Section 3.5(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and accurate list, as of the date hereof, of all Options, the number of Units

grant dates, expiration dates, exercise prices and vesting schedules thereof
and the names of the holders thereof.

 



 

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have outstanding any bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to
vote (or that are convertible into or exercisable for securities having the
right to vote) with the holders of equity interests in the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries on any matter.

 



 

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, except as set forth in _Section 3.5(f)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and its Subsidiaries do not
own any shares or other equity or ownership interests in any Person other than
the Subsidiaries; _it_ _being_ _understood_ that, for purposes of this
sentence, the Controlled JV Entities are deemed not to be Subsidiaries of the
Company. Except as set forth in _Section 3.5(f)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company that is directly or
indirectly wholly owned by the Company is the record and beneficial owner of
all the shares or other ownership interests in each of the Companys
Subsidiaries. Set forth on _Section 3.5(f)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule is the applicable percentage ownership of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in each of the Non-Controlled JV Entities as of the date hereof.
Except as set forth in _Section 3.5(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
on the Closing Date, the Company or the applicable Subsidiary of the Company
will hold all such shares or other ownership interests free and clear of any
Liens, other than Permitted Liens or Liens securing Indebtedness of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and other than shares or interests that are sold
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date without violating the
terms of this Agreement. The shares or other ownership interests in each
Subsidiary of the Company, and to the Knowledge of the Company, each Non-
Controlled JV Entity, (i) have been duly authorized, validly issued and fully
paid and are nonassessable; (ii) were not issued in violation of any
preemptive rights, rights of first refusal, purchase option, call option,
subscription right or other similar rights of any Person and (iii) have been
issued in compliance with applicable federal and state securities Laws.

 



 

(g) The Company or a wholly owned Subsidiary thereof is the sole record and
beneficial owner of, and has good and valid title to, all of the Acquired
Shares (as defined in the CPG Purchase Agreement), free and clear of any Lien,
other than those set forth on _Section 3.5(g)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. The Acquired Shares constitute 100% of the issued and outstanding
equity interests of the CPG Entities (other than LNR ADC Ventures, LLC) and
50% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of LNR ADC Ventures, LLC,
have been duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid (to the extent
required under the Company LLC Agreement) and are nonassessable (except as
such nonassessability may be affected by Section 18-607 of the Delaware LLC
Act). Assuming SCG has the requisite power and authority to be the lawful
owner of the Acquired Shares, upon the sale and delivery of the Acquired
Shares as provided in the CPG Purchase Agreement, SCG will acquire good and
valid title to such Acquired Shares, in each case (assuming the repayment of
the Indebtedness set forth on _Section 3.5(g)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and release of the pledges thereunder at Closing as contemplated by
this Agreement) free and clear of all Liens (other than the Liens arising
under applicable securities Laws) and free of any limitation or restriction on
the right to vote the Acquired Shares, in each case, other than those arising
from SCGs ownership. As of the date hereof, each of the entities identified
in _Section 1.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule satisfies the
definition of "Non-Controlled JV Entity".

Entities do not have any Liability or obligation to pay any fees or
commissions or any similar payment to any broker, finder, or agent with

obligated.

its face to be applicable to such other section or sections. Each
representation, warranty, covenant and agreement contained herein shall have
independent significance. Accordingly, if any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein is breached, the fact that there exists
another representation, warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the same
subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) shall not
detract from or mitigate the breach of the first representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement.

existing, and in good standing (or in active status) under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of organization.

result in a breach of, or constitute a default (with or without due notice or
lapse of time or both) or result in or give any Person any right of

Commitment Letter, other than any such default or breach that has been
irrevocably waived by the Lenders or otherwise cured in a timely manner by
Purchaser to the satisfaction of the Lenders. Purchaser

 



      
 

 



 

has timely paid, or will have timely paid as of the Closing Date, in full any
and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the

(g) Purchaser believes that the Debt Financing will be available on the
Closing Date. Purchaser acknowledges that its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not and will not be subject to
the receipt by Purchaser (or SCG, as the case may be) of any financing or the
consummation of any other transaction (other than as set forth in _Section
7.1(d)_ hereof with respect to the CPG Transaction).

 



 

5.7 _Purchase for Investment_. Purchaser has such knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of the purchase of the Units hereunder. Purchaser is acquiring the Units
for investment and not with a view toward, or present intention of, any
distribution or sale of the Units in violation of any federal or state
securities or "blue sky" Laws. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
will offer, sell, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or
encumber any of the Units without (i) registering such transaction under the
Securities Act or complying in all respects with an applicable exemption from
such registration and (ii) complying with all other applicable Laws.

 



 

5.8 _Brokers  Fees and Commissions_. Neither Purchaser nor any of its
directors, managers, officers, employees or Affiliates has employed any broker
or finder or incurred any Liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or
finders or other fees in connection with this Agreement or the Transaction,
other than any of the foregoing which will be paid solely by Purchaser or its
Affiliates.

 



 

5.9 _Certain Acknowledgments_. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that one or
more of the Sellers and/or their respective Affiliates are in the business of
owning, managing and/or investing, directly or indirectly, in assets and/or
businesses in the commercial real estate industry, which as of the date of
this Agreement or any time thereafter may be in competition with the Company
and its Affiliates. The representations, warranties, covenants and other
agreements of the Sellers set forth in _Section 2.8_, _Section 4.6_ and
_Section 6.17_ shall not operate in any manner to restrict the conduct of any
of the Sellers and/or their respective Affiliates as of the date of this
Agreement or at any time thereafter, subject to the express remedies of
Purchaser set forth in this Agreement with respect to any breach of such
Sections, or set forth in such Sections themselves. For purposes of this
_Section 5.9_, (i) the term "Affiliate", with respect to any Seller, means
any entity controlled by, controlling or under common control with such Seller
and (ii) the term "control" means the ability to exercise majority voting
power or to appoint a majority of the board of directors (or similar governing
body) of an entity, in each case, through equity ownership, contract or
otherwise.

and nature and taken in the Ordinary Course of Business) taken by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries that would require the prior written consent of
Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ but for the fact that such action
did not meet or exceed a threshold set forth in this _Section 6.1_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.1(a)_:

 



 

(i) From the date of this Agreement through the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall have the right to acquire (x) CMBS and/or CDO bonds and/or
whole loans (or participations therein) in respect of the transactions set
forth on _Section 6.1_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (y) in one or
more transactions in the Ordinary Course of Business, from one or more Non-
Group Members, up to $25,000,000 (based on consideration paid) in the
aggregate of CMBS and/or CDO bonds and/or whole loans (or participations
therein) so long as no individual purchase, or series of related purchases,
exceeds $10,000,000 (based on consideration paid); _provided_ that (1) the
restrictions in _Section 6.1(a)(v)_ shall not apply to the sale of CMBS
and/or CDO bonds and/or whole loans (or participations therein) in the
Ordinary Course of Business by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the
extent the consideration received from such sales is used to fund the purchase
of CMBS and/or CDO bonds and/or whole loans (or participations therein)
pursuant to this clause _(i)_ and (2) the consideration received from such
sales of CMBS and/or CDO bonds and/or whole loans (or participations therein)
shall be credited towards the $25,000,000 threshold (such that, for example,
any such sales for $10,000,000 in total consideration provide an additional
$10,000,000 in permitted acquisitions of such CMBS, CDO bonds and whole
loans); _provided_ , _further_ , that if Purchaser consents in writing (which
the parties agree may be granted by electronic mail from an authorized
representative of Purchaser) to any acquisitions of CMBS and/or CDO bonds
and/or whole loans (or participations therein) referenced in this clause _(i)_
, the aggregate consideration paid in respect of such acquisitions shall not
be applied against the thresholds stated herein. From the date hereof to the
Closing, the Company agrees to report to Purchaser on a weekly basis as to all
actions taken in respect of this clause _(i)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) From the date of this Agreement through the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall have the right to originate loans in the Ordinary Course of
Business in connection with the Companys conduit business in amounts that do
not, individually or in the aggregate, result in an equity investment by the
Company or its Subsidiaries in such loans of more than $50,000,000, in the
aggregate; _provided_ that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall also have
the right to incur, pursuant to the existing repurchase facilities of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (to the extent permitted thereunder), for
purposes of such origination indebtedness equal to 75% of the loan to value
ratio (as determined in accordance with the existing repurchase facilities of
the Company and its Subsidiaries); _provided_ , _further_ , that (1) the
restrictions in _Section 6.1(a)(v)_ shall not apply to the sale of loans
originated in the Ordinary Course of Business in connection with the Companys
conduit business to the extent the consideration received from such sales is
used to fund the origination of loans pursuant to this clause _(ii)_ and (2)
(x) if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries sells any such loans to a Non-
Group Member the $50,000,000 threshold shall calculated without regard to such
loan origination except that the amount of gain or loss realized by the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries as a result of such sale shall be applied as a
credit or deduct, as applicable, to such threshold and (y) if Purchaser
consents in writing (which the parties agree may be granted by electronic mail
from an authorized representative of Purchaser) to any loan origination
referenced in this clause _(ii)_ , such originations shall not be applied
against the threshold ( _provided_ that, notwithstanding this clause _(y)_ ,
in no event shall the Company and its Subsidiaries have loans outstanding that
were originated in connection with the Companys conduit business after the
date of this Agreement that, individually or in the aggregate, result in an
equity investment by the Company or its Subsidiaries in such loans of more
than $75,000,000). Notwithstanding the foregoing, all references to
$50,000,000 in this clause _(ii)_ shall instead refer to $25,000,000 until
the Company consummates the GSMC 2013-GC10 securitization transaction.

 



 

(iii) From the date of this Agreement through the Closing, except (1) for
Permitted Activities, (2) as required by applicable Law or (3) as described in
_Section 6.1(c)_, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its Affiliates which it Controls to, in each case
without the prior written consent of Purchaser (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and which the parties agree may
be granted by electronic mail from an authorized representative of Purchaser)
take or cause to be taken any action, or exercise any power or authority, or
fail to take any action required of it under applicable Law, or any existing
Contract, permit, license, or authorization, or take or permit to occur any
Specified Restricted Activity, in respect of any of the commercial properties
identified in _Exhibit O-1_ (collectively, the " _Commercial Properties_ "
and each individually a " _Commercial Property_ ").

 



 

Without limiting anything contained in this clause _(iii)_ , the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates which it Controls to,
consult with Purchaser with respect the Commercial Properties (including
regarding (x) the management, maintenance, development, construction,
operation, and remediation thereof, (y) any substantive communications with
any Governmental Authority and (z) any offers or solicitations regarding any
Commercial Property), on a weekly basis (and, with respect to material issues
with respect to a Commercial Property, at Purchasers request, on a "day-to-
day"

 



      
 

 



 

basis), and shall report to Purchaser regarding the status of same and any
material issues related thereto as Purchaser may reasonably request (which may
include requests for information regarding any Permitted Activities; _it_
_being_ _understood_ that the Company shall not be required to disclose any
information that would reasonably be likely to result in a waiver of attorney-
client privilege; _provided_ that in no event shall the Company consult any
attorney regarding any matter with the intent to prevent disclosure to
Purchaser hereunder).

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this clause _(iii)_ , Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions in this clause _(iii)_ shall
not apply to any action taken or caused to be taken, or any exercise of any
power or authority, by any Subsidiary of the Company (referred to in this
paragraph as an " _LNR Entity_ "), acting in its capacity as a fiduciary as a
partner or member in any other Subsidiary or any JV Entity, so long as (v)
such action taken or caused to be taken or exercise of power or authority has
been requested in writing by the other partners or members (or advisory board
or similar authorized representatives of such other partners or members under
the applicable Organizational Documents) in such other Subsidiary or JV Entity
such that such LNR Entity is contractually obligated under the terms of the
applicable Organizational Documents of such other Subsidiary or JV Entity to
take such action, (w) such LNR Entity has used commercially reasonable efforts
to satisfy such request of such other partners or members (or advisory board
or similar authorized representatives) without otherwise breaching the terms
of this clause _(iii)_ , (x) such action is not and does not result in a
Prohibited Real Estate Financing (except to the extent necessary to effectuate
a payoff and release of a Real Estate Financing in connection with the sale of
property disclosed on _Section 6.1(a)(v)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule)
or a Prohibited Carson Action, (y) such LNR Entity has reasonably consulted
with external counsel regarding same, and (z) such LNR Entity has determined
in its sole judgment, exercised in good faith and after consultation with
external counsel, that failing to take or cause to be taken such action, or
failing to exercise such power or authority, would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of fiduciary duty by such LNR Entity in its capacity as a
fiduciary to such other partners or members; provided, however, prior to
taking any such action, or exercising any such power or authority, Company and
such LNR Entity shall first reasonably consult with Purchaser regarding same
(which reasonable consultation shall include, at Purchasers request, delivery
to Purchaser by Company and such LNR Entity of a reasonably detailed written
explanation of same, it being understood that no such explanation shall be
required to include the legal analysis of counsel where it would be reasonably
likely to result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege).

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for purposes of
_ARTICLE IX_ of this Agreement, to the extent the Company, its Subsidiary or
Affiliate which it Controls requests approval from the Purchaser in respect of
any action prohibited by this clause _(iii)_ , delivers to Purchaser all
information reasonably required by Purchaser in order to determine whether or
not to grant such approval, and provides Purchaser a reasonable time period
(taking into account the facts and circumstances) to respond to such request,
and the Purchaser refuses to consent to such request or fails to respond
within such reasonable time period, none of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to obtain indemnification under _ARTICLE IX_ for any Losses
proximately caused by the failure of

 



      
 

 



 

the Purchaser to provide such consent or respond within such reasonable time
period (as the case may be).

 



 

The term " _Specified Restricted Activity_ " means any of the following
actions or omissions with respect the Commercial Properties, taken by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates which it Controls in any
capacity (including as general partner, managing member, or manager for any JV
Entity, and whether related to the management, maintenance, development,
construction, operation, or remediation of any Commercial Property):

 



 

(A) alienating, encumbering, transferring, optioning, leasing, assigning,
selling, or conveying any interest or portion of any interest therein or any
portion thereof, or recording, or authorizing the recordation of any
instrument or other document against any portion thereof;

 



 

(B)(i) amending, modifying, supplementing, extending, terminating, or
retracting any existing Contract material to the development, operation or
maintenance of a Commercial Property, or relating to the sale of any portion
of any Commercial Property, or any permit, license, or authorization related
to any Commercial Property, including rescinding, terminating, retracting, or
modifying, or requesting a rescindment, retraction or release from, any issued
letters of credit or other collateral or guaranty, or credit enhancement of
any kind or nature, with respect thereto, or (ii) taking any actions (or
failing to take any actions) under any existing Contract, permit, license, or
authorization related thereto that would reasonably be expected to result in a
breach or default thereunder or Losses thereunder (including ordering or
authorizing any change orders under applicable remediation or construction
agreements or advancing funds under any Contract) in each case, to the extent
related to a Commercial Property;

 



 

(C)(i) entering into any Contract material to the development, operation or
maintenance of a Commercial Property or relating to the sale of any portion of
any Commercial Property (a " _Sale Contract_ "), or (ii) obtaining or applying
for any permit, license, or authorization material to the development,
operation or maintenance of a Commercial Property; _provided_ that it shall
not be a Specified Restricted Activity to obtain or apply for sub-permits
underneath a master permit, certificates of occupancy and/or other similar
occupation permits and/or other permits in furtherance of existing plans
and/or specifications and/or conduct or permit inspections in connection
therewith, in each case, in the Ordinary Course of Business; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that this proviso shall not apply to obtaining, applying for or
modifying permits, licenses or authorizations that would result in a change of
use, zoning, entitlements or remediation activities or otherwise that would
reasonably be expected to adversely impact the Commercial Property in any
material respect, each of which shall be Specified Restricted Activities (any
of the foregoing, a " _Fundamental Permitting Change_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(D) except to the extent consistent with the proviso in subsection _(C)_ , to
the fullest extent reasonably practicable, participating in substantive
communications, whether orally or in writing, with any Governmental Authority
(including any redevelopment agency) related to a Commercial Property ( _it_
_being_ _understood_ that this shall not restrict the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from any immaterial communications with respect to a Commercial
Property that in the sole judgment of the Company exercised in good faith are
necessary to maintain adequate relationships with such Governmental
Authority);

 



 

(E) altering or seeking to alter any zoning or entitlements,

 



 

(F) pursuing, participating in, or actively cooperating with changes in the
composition of any metropolitan district boards of directors, any service
plans, service areas or district boundaries;

(or remarketing or reissuance) of any bonds;

submitting for approval to any Governmental Authority any document or
instrument material to the development, operation or maintenance of a
Commercial Property;

 



 

(K) taking any actions in connection with any litigation or other dispute
resolution process or procedure related to a Commercial Property, whether as
plaintiff, defendant or otherwise, ( _provided_ that this subsection _(K)_
shall not restrict the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from prosecuting or
defending any actions in the Ordinary Course of Business subject only to the
limitations in _Section 6.1(a)(xii)_);

 



 

(L) modifying, replacing, terminating or allowing coverage to lapse under any
policy of insurance related to a Commercial Property;

 



 

(M) undertaking or performing any capital or other construction work related
to a Commercial Property (except to the extent necessary in an

 



      
 

 



 

emergency situation to remedy an imminent threat to public safety or imminent

(N) failing to timely perform all work in respect of a Commercial Property
that is guaranteed by any completion guaranty, or that is required to be
performed pursuant to any contract or agreement with a Governmental Authority
or as a condition of an approval granted by a Governmental Authority, in each
case, unless taking such action would otherwise constitute a Specified
Restricted Activity, in which case, if the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary or Affiliate which it controls provides reasonable advance notice
of such required work and seeks consent of Purchaser in respect of performing
such work, this subsection _(N)_ shall be deemed to be satisfied in respect
of such specific situation ( _provided_ that, if consent is timely granted by
Purchaser, then the Company or its applicable Subsidiary or Affiliate which it
controls must timely complete such work or be in breach of this subsection
_(N)_ ); _it_ _being_ _understood_ _and_ _agreed_ that to the extent the
Company obtains Purchasers consent to fail to perform timely any such work,
and such failure would otherwise breach another provision of this _Section
6.1(b)(iii)_, such failure to timely perform shall be deemed not to breach
this _Section 6.1(b)(iii)_;

 



 

(O) failing to properly store and maintain any construction materials related
thereto in the Ordinary Course of Business (whether located at any Commercial
Property or offsite, and except such materials that are incorporated into any
construction projects undertaken in compliance with the terms of this _Section
6.1_);

 



 

(P) any Prohibited Real Estate Financing (except to the extent necessary to
effectuate a payoff and release of a Real Estate Financing in connection with
the sale of property disclosed on _Section 6.1(a)(v)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule), and

 



 

(Q) any Prohibited Carson Action.

 



 

Without limiting the definition of " _Contract_ " as used elsewhere in this
Agreement, as used in this _Section 6.1_ the term Contract expressly includes
any agricultural lease, sale agreement, homeowners association agreement,
disposition and development agreement, pass-through agreement, letter of
intent, option agreement, guaranty, credit enhancement, payment assurance or
similar agreement, understanding, easement, right-of-way, covenant, condition,
restriction, lien, and any agreement regarding rights in, and ability to
explore for or extract, any water, gas, oil and/or minerals.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that in no event shall the
ability of the Sellers, the Company, its Subsidiaries and JV Entities to
undertake Permitted Activities pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ limit the other
obligations of such Persons described elsewhere in this Agreement or the CPG
Purchase Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) Nothing in this _Section 6.1_ shall apply to any of the Companys
Subsidiaries acting in their capacity as a "servicer", "primary servicer",
"master servicer", "special servicer" or "subservicer" to the extent any such
Subsidiary determines in its sole judgment exercised in good faith that taking
such restricted action or failing to take such restricted action would
reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of contract by such Subsidiary
in the performance of its services in any such capacity under the servicing or
similar Contract governing such Subsidiarys activities in such capacity.

 



 

(c) Any covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this _Section 6.1_,
insofar as it relates to any Subsidiary of the Company, shall also be
applicable to the JV Entities; _provided_ , _however_ , that such covenants
and agreements shall be deemed to have been complied with by the Company with
respect to a JV Entity if (i) the Company has used its reasonable best efforts
through any voting, consent, approval or management rights in the capacity as
director (or similar status), general partner, manager, and/or equityholder to
cause such JV Entity to comply therewith and (ii) without limiting the
reasonable best efforts standard in the preceding clause _(i)_ , if the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company has a right to vote, consent to or
approve or disapprove any action of a JV Entity (whether or not such vote,
consent, approval or disapproval is controlling or determinative), where the
taking or omitting to take such action by the JV Entity would result in a
breach of any covenant or agreement under this Agreement if such JV Entity
were a Subsidiary of the Company, the Company or its applicable Subsidiary
shall cast such vote, or grant or withhold such consent or approval against
such action except, as the case may be, as otherwise directed in writing by
Purchaser acting in Purchasers sole discretion. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the
restrictions in _Section 6.1(b)(i)_ and _Section 6.1(b)(ii)_ shall not (i)
apply to any action taken or caused to be taken, or any exercise of any power
or authority, by any Subsidiary not wholly owned directly or indirectly by the
Company or any JV Entity so long as (x) such action taken or caused to be
taken or exercise of power or authority has been requested by any third party
investor in such Subsidiary or JV Entity or, with respect to the CPI Fund and
CPI Fund GP (acting in its capacity as a fiduciary as general partner of the
CPI Fund), by a majority of the members of the CPI Fund Advisory Board, and
the relevant Subsidiary or JV Entity (including, with respect to the CPI Fund,
CPI Fund GP) has used commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy such request
without otherwise breaching the terms of _Section 6.1(b)_, (y) is not and
does not result in a Prohibited Real Estate Financing (except to the extent
necessary to effectuate a payoff and release of a Real Estate Financing in
connection with the sale of property disclosed on _Section 6.1(a)(v)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule), or a Prohibited Carson Action, and (z) the
Company has reasonably consulted with external counsel regarding same and has
determined in its sole judgment, exercised in good faith after consultation
with external counsel, that failing to take or cause to be taken such action,
or failing to exercise such power or authority, would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of fiduciary duty by the Company or a Subsidiary or
Controlled JV Entity of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to
taking any such action, or exercising any such power or authority, the Company
shall first reasonably consult with Purchaser regarding same (which reasonable
consultation shall include, at Purchasers request, delivery to Purchaser by
Company of a reasonably detailed written explanation of same, it being
understood that no such explanation shall be required to include the legal
analysis of counsel where it would be reasonably likely to result in a waiver
of attorney-client privilege), or (ii) require any actions or inactions that
would result in a breach or

 



      
 

 



 

default under any of the agreements existing as of the date of this Agreement
listed on _Section 6.1(c)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(d) The parties agree that nothing contained in this _Section 6.1_, or
otherwise in this Agreement, shall make any party the fiduciary of any other
party for any purpose whatsoever, nor shall this _Section 6.1_ or any other
provision of this Agreement be deemed to create any form of business
organization between or among the parties, including a joint venture or
partnership.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.1(a)_, from the
date of this Agreement until the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall have the right to engage in credit hedging in the Ordinary Course of
Business.

 



 

6.2 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

 



 

(a) The Company and the Sellers, on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other,
shall cooperate with the other and use (and cause each of its Subsidiaries to
cooperate with the other and use) reasonable best efforts to take or cause to
be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done all things (including through
any voting, consent, approval or management rights in the capacity as director
(or similar status), general partner, manager, and/or equityholder of any JV
Entity), necessary or advisable to consummate the Transaction as promptly as
practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all
documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings
(including the notification and required form under the HSR Act and any other
notifications or filings required under any applicable foreign antitrust,
competition or foreign investment Laws to consummate the Transaction) and
obtaining as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations,
authorizations, permits and other approvals, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Sellers and Purchaser, that are necessary or advisable to
obtain from any Person (including any Governmental Authority and, if
applicable, any member, partner, equityholder or other Person whose consent is
necessary or advisable under the Organizational Documents of any JV Entity or
Subsidiary) in order to consummate the Transaction, including those consents
of the applicable counterparties with respect to the Agreements listed on
_Section 6.2(a)(1)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ ,
_however_ that the parties shall not be required to pay or commit to pay any
amount to, or incur any obligation in favor of, any Person from whom any such
consents, registrations, authorizations, permits or other approvals may be
required (other than customary filing fees payable to Governmental Authorities
and nominal filing or application fees paid to other third parties as
contemplated by written agreements with such third parties as in effect prior
to the date of this Agreement) and Purchaser shall not be required to agree to
any conditions or restrictions imposed by any such Person that, individually
or in the aggregate, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser exercised in good
faith, would materially impair (or would reasonably be expected to materially
impair) the ability of Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the economic benefits to Purchaser arising therefrom; and _provided_
, _further_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the Sellers
shall not, and shall cause the Subsidiaries of the Company not to, seek any of
the consents, registrations, authorizations, permits and other approvals set
forth in _Section 6.2(a)(2)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Purchaser shall pay all filing fees in

 



       
 

 



 

connection with the filings made by the parties under the HSR Act and in
connection with the Other Required Competition Approvals.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
_Section 6.2_, each of the Company and Purchaser agrees promptly to take or
cause to be taken (and to cause each of its Subsidiaries to take or cause to
be taken) the following actions: (i) use reasonable best efforts to prepare
and file with each relevant Governmental Authority as promptly as practicable
all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings
required under applicable antitrust, competition or foreign investment Laws
and to obtain as promptly as practicable the expiration or early termination
of the waiting periods under the HSR Act and all other consents,
registrations, authorizations, permits and other approvals that are necessary
or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental Authority in order to
consummate the Transaction, and (ii) provide to each relevant Governmental
Authority all non-privileged information and documents requested by such
Governmental Authority or that are necessary or advisable to provide in order
to obtain the expiration or early termination of the waiting periods under the
HSR Act and to obtain such other consents, registrations, authorizations,
permits and other approvals. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser agrees
to use reasonable best efforts to bring about the expiration or termination of
the waiting period under the HSR Act and/or to obtain clearance or approval
under any applicable foreign antitrust, competition or foreign investment Laws
in order to enable the Closing to be completed by the End Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be required to oppose any motion
or action for a temporary, preliminary or permanent injunction against the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, divest or hold separate any
assets or voting securities, terminate or modify any existing relationships or
contractual rights, or enter into a consent decree order requiring the
divestiture or holding separate of any assets or voting securities or the
termination or modification of existing relationships and contractual rights,
to enable the Closing to be completed by the End Date. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, within six (6) Business Days from the date of
this Agreement, the Purchaser shall provide the Company with all information
concerning itself and its Affiliates which the Company is required to provide
in connection with the initial filings and registrations with any Governmental
Authority set forth on _Section 7.2(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(c) Unless prohibited by applicable Law relating to the exchange of
information, prior to the Closing, the Company and the Sellers, on the one
hand, and Purchaser, on the other, shall (i) keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the Transaction, including by
promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications
received by the Company, any Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, or Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other, from
any Person (including any Governmental Authority) with respect to the
Transaction, (ii) have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable will consult the other and consider in good faith the views of the
other on, all filings made with, or written materials submitted to, any
Governmental Authority or any other Person from whom any consent,
registration, authorization, permit or other approval is necessary or
advisable to be obtained in connection with the Transaction ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the parties shall have
the obligation to disclose to any other party pursuant to this clause _(ii)_
any confidential information relating to itself or any of its Affiliates),
(iii) provide the other with copies of all correspondence relating to the
Transaction between it or any of its Representatives and any Governmental

 



      
 

 



 

Authority or any other Person from whom any consent, registration,
authorization, permit or other approval is necessary or advisable to be
obtained in connection with the Transaction and (iv) include, to the extent
reasonably practicable, in all telephone calls and meetings regarding the
Transaction with a Governmental Authority or any other Person from whom any
consent, registration, authorization, permit or other approval is necessary or
advisable to be obtained in connection with the Transaction, Representatives
of Purchaser and Representatives of the Sellers. In exercising the foregoing
rights and complying with the foregoing obligations, the Company, the Sellers
and Purchaser shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

 



 

(d) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company and each Seller, on
the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other, shall, upon request by the other,
furnish the other with all information concerning itself and its Subsidiaries
and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to
consummate the Transaction as promptly as practicable in connection with any
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Purchaser,
the Company, each Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries with or to
any Third Party and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transaction.

 



 

6.3 _Termination of Affiliate Transactions_. Each Seller shall take, or cause
to be taken, all actions necessary to terminate, on an arms-length basis,
prior to the Closing, those Contracts between any member of the Company Group,
on the one hand, and such Seller or any Affiliates thereof (excluding any
member of the Company Group), on the other, which are specified in _Section
3.20_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, other than those Contracts specified
in _Section 6.3_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. In addition, if
Purchaser, within one year after the Closing Date, discovers any Contract
between any member of the Company Group, on the one hand, and a Seller or any
of its Affiliates, on the other, that was in place as of Closing and is not
listed in _Section 3.20_ or _6.3_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
Purchaser shall have the right to request, by written notice to the relevant
Seller given within 60 days from the time the Purchaser discovers such
Contract, that such Seller (or its relevant Affiliate) terminate the Contract,
and if Purchaser does so on a timely basis such Seller shall take, or cause to
be taken, all actions necessary to terminate that Contract promptly.

 



 

6.4 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. In the event any federal, state, local or foreign
excise, sales, use, value added, transfer (including real property transfer),
stamp, documentary, filing, recordation and other similar Taxes and fees that
are imposed or assessed on the sale of the Units pursuant to _Section 2.1_ or
with respect to the CPG Transaction, together with any interest, additions or
penalties with respect thereto and any interest in respect of such additions
or penalties (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") are required to be paid by (i) a Seller,
then Purchaser shall reimburse such Seller for 50% of such Transfer Taxes or
(ii) any other Person, then such Transfer Taxes shall be paid 50% by the
Sellers (with each Seller liable solely for its Pro Rata Portion thereof) and
50% by Purchaser. Purchaser, or the Sellers if required by applicable Law,
shall duly file on a timely basis all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to any Transfer Tax, and provide to the other party
upon request evidence of timely filing and payment of such Transfer Taxes.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Withholding_. Each Seller shall cause to be delivered at the Closing a
valid and duly executed certificate, in compliance with Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1445-2(b), certifying that such Seller is not a foreign person for
purposes of Section 1445 of the Code.

 



 

(c) _Liability for Taxes_.

 



 

(i) Each Seller shall, severally and not jointly, be liable for and pay, and
pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(ii)(E)_, shall, severally and not jointly,
indemnify and hold harmless, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from and
against such Sellers Pro Rata Portion of any and all (A) Taxes imposed on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or for which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries may otherwise be liable, as a result of having been a member of
an Affiliated Group (including Taxes for which the Company or any Subsidiary
may be liable pursuant to Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 or similar provisions
of state, local or foreign law as a result of having been a member of an
Affiliated Group and any Taxes resulting from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries ceasing to be a member of any Affiliated Group), and (B) Taxes
imposed on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or for which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries may otherwise be liable, in any case referred to in
clause _(A)_ or _(B)_ , for any taxable year or period that ends on or before
the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) any indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.4(c)_
shall not be subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.1(d)_ other
than subsections _(ii)_ , _(v)_ and _(vii)(c)_ and (y) the Sellers shall not
have any liability under this _Section 6.4(c)(i)_ for (A) Entity Level Taxes,
which the parties agree are a liability of the Company and the Subsidiaries
and not of Purchaser and, accordingly, shall be timely paid out of the funds
of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the Ordinary Course of Business or (B)
Taxes (other than Specified Taxes, for which the Sellers shall remain liable
under this _Section 6.4(c)(i)_) imposed on and paid or payable at the entity
level by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent accrued in the
Interim Financial Statements and in the aggregate not in excess of $4,402,406.
The Sellers liability under this Agreement with respect to the Taxes imposed
on or paid by any Subsidiary shall not exceed an amount equal to the Companys
proportionate share of such Tax (based on the Companys percentage ownership
of such Subsidiary as of the Closing Date) and, for the avoidance of doubt,
each Seller shall be severally and not jointly liable for such Sellers Pro
Rata Portion of such amount. The amounts for which any Seller shall be liable
under _Sections 9.1(a)(ii)(E)_ and _6.4(c)_ are subject to certain limits
set forth in _Section 6.4(c)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(ii) For purposes of _Section 6.4(c)(i)_, whenever it is necessary to
determine the liability for Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for a Straddle Period, the determination of the Taxes of the Company or such
Subsidiary for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the
Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Company or its
Subsidiary, as the case may be, had a taxable year or period which ended at
the close of the Closing Date, except that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for
depreciation, shall be apportioned on a pro rata time basis; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that with respect to Entity Level Taxes, "Closing Date" shall be
replaced with "September 30, 2012" wherever it appears in this _Section
6.4(c)(ii)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) Purchaser shall be entitled to any refund or credit with respect to
Taxes (including any interest relating thereto) imposed on the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that results from the carryback of losses, credits or
similar items from a taxable year or period that begins after the Closing Date
and any such refund or credit received by the Sellers or any of their
respective Affiliates shall be paid by the Sellers to Purchaser within fifteen
days after such Seller or its Affiliate actually receives or is deemed to
receive such refund or credit, or realizes an actual reduction in Taxes as a
result of such refund or credit. The Sellers shall be entitled to all other
refunds or credits with respect to Taxes (including related interest) for
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
with respect to Entity Level Taxes, "Closing Date" shall be replaced with
"September 30, 2012" wherever it appears in this _Section 6.4(c)(iii)_.

 



 

(d) _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) The Sellers shall file or cause to be filed when due (taking into account
all extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns that are required to be
filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to Taxable years
ending on or before the Closing Date (whether or not such Tax Returns were
filed after the Closing Date), and the Sellers shall remit or cause to be
remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Purchaser shall file or
cause to be filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly
obtained) all other Tax Returns that are required to be filed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and Purchaser shall remit or cause to be remitted
any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.

 



 

(ii) All Tax Returns that the Sellers are required to file or cause to be
filed in accordance with this _Section 6.4_ shall be prepared and filed in a
manner consistent with past practice and, on such Tax Returns, no inconsistent
position shall be taken, inconsistent election made or inconsistent method
adopted that would have the effect of deferring income to periods ending after
September 30, 2012 or accelerating deductions to periods ending on or before
September 30, 2012. With respect to any Tax Return to be filed by the Sellers
pursuant to this _Section 6.4_, (x) with respect to Entity Level Taxes or for
an entity that is classified as a "C corporation" for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, not less than 30 days prior to the due date for such Tax Return,
taking into account extensions, the Sellers shall provide Purchaser with a
draft copy of such Tax Return for Purchasers review and consent, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, and (y) for any other Taxes or entity, not less
than 30 days prior to the due date for such Tax Return, taking into account
extensions (the " _Filing Date_ "), Sellers shall provide Purchaser with a
draft copy of such Tax Return for review and comment, and consider any
comments made by Purchaser in good faith; _provided_ that such comments are
provided to the Sellers no later than 15 days prior to the Filing Date. With
respect to any Tax Return to be filed by Purchaser pursuant to this _Section
6.4_ that relates to any Straddle Period with respect to which the Sellers may
have liability under this _Section 6.4_, not less than 30 days prior to the
due date for such Tax Return, taking into account extensions, Purchaser shall
provide the Sellers with a draft copy of such Tax Return for the review and
consent of the Sellers, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Purchaser
shall prepare and file such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with past
practice and, on such Tax Returns, no inconsistent position shall be taken,
inconsistent election made or inconsistent method adopted that would have the

 



      
 

 



 

effect of accelerating income to periods ending on or before the Closing Date
or deferring deductions to periods beginning after the Closing Date. Purchaser
shall not file an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to a
Subsidiary without the consent of the Sellers.

 



 

(iii) The Sellers or Purchaser shall reimburse the other party the Taxes for
which any of the Sellers or Purchaser is liable pursuant to subsections _(a)_
and _(c)_ of this _Section 6.4_ but which are remitted in respect of any Tax
Return to be filed by the other party pursuant to subsections _(a)_ or _(d)_
of this _Section 6.4_ upon the written request of the party entitled to
reimbursement setting forth in detail the computation of the amount owed by
the Sellers or Purchaser, as the case may be, but in no event earlier than ten
(10) days prior to the due date for paying such Taxes. For the avoidance of
doubt, such reimbursement obligations shall not be subject to the limitations
on indemnification set forth in _ARTICLE IX_.

 



 

(e) _Cooperation_. Purchaser, the Sellers, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates and
such parties respective directors, officers, employees, agents, auditors and
representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns (including any claim for a refund) and in resolving all disputes and
audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes, including
maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in
connection with Taxes. Without limiting the foregoing, Cerberus hereby agrees
that it and its Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate in connection with any
IRS audit of a pre-closing Tax Return relating to any issue with respect to
which ownership information regarding Cerberus and its Affiliates is relevant.

 



 

(f) _Partnership Termination; Auction.com Equity Interests_.

 



 

(i) For U.S. federal income Tax purposes, Purchaser, the Company and the
Sellers agree to treat the Transaction as governed by Rev. Rul. 99-6, 1999-1
C.B. 432 (Situation 2), and to treat the Transaction as resulting in the
termination of the Company within the meaning of Section 708(b)(1)(A) of the
Code as of the Closing Date, and agree to file all Tax Returns in a manner
consistent with the foregoing, and not take any position, whether in any Tax
Return, audit, examination, claim, adjustment litigation or other proceeding
with respect to a Tax, which is inconsistent with such treatment, unless
required to do so by applicable Law.

 



 

(ii) The Company and the Sellers shall treat the units issued as Auction.com
Equity Interests as received in a transaction under Section 721 of the Code.
The Company shall treat the issuance of warrants issued as Auction.com Equity
Interests in accordance with Section 707(a)(2)(B) of the Code.

 



 

(g) _Survival; Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the obligations of the parties set forth in this _Section
6.4_ shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statutes of
limitation (taking into account extensions thereof), and shall not be subject
to the limitations on indemnification set forth in _Section 9.1(d)_ other
than subsections _(ii)_ , _(v)_ and _(vii)(c)_.

 



      
 

 



 

6.5 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) With respect to the employees of the Company Group who are listed on
_Section 6.5(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (" _CPG Employees_ "),
Purchaser, in its sole discretion, may elect to either (i) cause the Company
to continue to employ such employees and enter into an employee leasing
arrangement with SCG or one of its Affiliates under which Purchaser shall
lease the services of the CPG Employees to SCG or one of its Affiliates
following the Closing Date or (ii) cause SCG or one of its Affiliates to offer
employment to such employees commencing immediately after the Closing. All
such employees who accept SCGs or one of its Affiliates offer of employment
and actually perform services for SCG or one of its Affiliates on or after the
Closing Date are hereinafter referred to as the " _Transferred Employees_."

 



 

(b) _Compensation and Benefits_.

 



 

(i) Purchaser agrees that, during the period commencing on the Closing Date
and ending on the first (1st) anniversary thereof, Purchaser shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, provide each Transferred Employee (if any) with (1)
base salary or wage rate (as applicable) and annual cash bonus opportunities
which are no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate and annual cash
bonus opportunities provided immediately prior to the Closing Date, (2)
welfare benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
welfare benefits provided immediately prior to the Closing Date, (3) to the
extent that Purchaser, in its sole discretion, permits Transferred Employees
to participate in a pension plan maintained by SCG or one of its Affiliates,
pension benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate to those pension
benefits provided under the plan listed on _Section 6.5(b)(i)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and (4) severance benefits that are no less favorable than
the severance benefits provided by the Company Group immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

 



 

(ii) Purchaser (A) agrees that, during the period commencing on the Closing
Date and ending on the first (1st) anniversary thereof, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause the Company Group to, provide each employee of the Company Group
who is employed as of immediately prior to the Closing Date and who is not a
Transferred Employee (such employees of the Company Group, together with
Transferred Employees (if any), collectively " _Covered Employees_ ") with (1)
base salary or wage rate (as applicable) and annual cash bonus opportunities
which are no less favorable than the base salary or wage rate and annual cash
bonus opportunities provided immediately prior to the Closing Date, (2)
pension and welfare benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those pension and welfare benefits provided immediately prior to
the Closing Date and (3) severance benefits that are no less favorable than
the severance benefits provided by the Company Group immediately prior to the
Closing Date and (B) subject to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and effective as of the Closing Date, shall cause the
Company to honor each of the employee incentive arrangements set forth in
_Section 6.5(b)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall cause any employee benefit plans in which the Covered
Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing Date to take into
account for

 



      
 

 



 

purposes of eligibility, vesting and, for purposes of vacation and severance,
level of benefits thereunder (other than for benefit accrual purposes or to
the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits)
service by such employees to the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
as if such service were with Purchaser or its Affiliates, to the same extent
such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable. With respect to any employee benefit plans
maintained for the benefit of the Covered Employees following the Closing Date
(whether maintained by Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates), Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates or the Company and
any successor thereto, to, (i) use commercially reasonably efforts to cause
there to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition
limitations or waiting period requirements to the same extent waived under
comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable and (ii)
give effect, in determining any deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-
pocket limitations, to amounts paid by such employees during the calendar year
in which the Closing Date occurs under similar plans maintained by the Company
or its Subsidiaries, as applicable.

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall, or shall cause its Affiliates or the Company and any
successor thereto to, honor, assume, fulfill and discharge the Companys and
its Subsidiaries obligations under the plans, policies and agreements
identified in _Section 6.5(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule in
accordance with their terms. Without limiting the foregoing, if the Closing
Date occurs prior to the payment of each eligible Covered Employees annual
cash bonus in respect of the 2012 bonus year (the " _2012 Bonus_ "), Purchaser
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates or the Company to, pay such Covered
Employee, at the time the 2012 Bonus would otherwise be paid, the Covered
Employees 2012 Bonus in accordance with the bonus targets, performance
measures and other applicable terms in place immediately prior to the Closing
Date, based on the actual level of performance achieved for the 2012 bonus
year.

 



 

(e) The Company shall use reasonable efforts to effectuate (i) any assignment,
as requested by Purchaser prior to the Closing Date, of the Benefit Plans
listed on _Section 6.5(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (ii) any
amendment to such Benefit Plans to clarify that the transfer of the
Transferred Employees employment to SCG or one of its Affiliates will not
entitle any Transferred Employee to any severance benefits thereunder; _it_
_being_ _understood_ _and_ _agreed_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that the
transfer of the Transferred Employees employment to SCG or one of its
Affiliates will not entitle any Transferred Employee to severance benefits
under any Company-wide severance plan, practice or policy. Prior to adopting
such amendment, the Company shall allow Purchaser to review such amendment and
cooperate with Purchaser to make changes to such amendment reasonably
requested by Purchaser.

 



 

(f) Sellers shall have no obligation to reimburse the Company for any earned
and unused vacation days and (if applicable) sick days under the Companys
vacation and sick pay policy, including any banked amounts, upon a Transferred
Employees termination of employment with the Company and in accordance with
the Companys vacation and sick pay policy at or before the Closing Date and
any such payments made by the Company shall not be deemed to be Transaction
Expenses.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Each of the Sellers and the Company hereby agree that any noncompetition
restrictions in an employment agreement covering a Transferred Employee, and
any confidentiality restrictions in an employment agreement covering a
Transferred Employee that pertain to the confidential information of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent it relates to the Business, shall
not prohibit such Transferred Employee from performing his or her necessary
and required duties with the Business, and hereby assigns to Purchaser the
right to enforce any such restrictions on behalf of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the extent that such restrictions relate to the Business.

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
treated as an amendment or other modification of any particular Benefit Plan;
(ii) require Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates to
employ or continue to employ any particular employee of the Company Group or
maintain any benefit plan or arrangement after the Closing Date; or (iii) give

applicable Law), each present and former manager, director and officer (the "
_Managers_ ") of the Company and its Subsidiaries and each employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who serves as a fiduciary of a Benefit Plan or a
Non-U.S. Benefit Plan (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (together
with the Managers, the " _Indemnitees_ ") against Losses incurred in
connection with any Legal Proceeding, arising out of or related to such
Indemnitees service with the Company or its Subsidiaries or services
performed by such Indemnitees at the request of the Company or its
Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed prior to,
at or after the Closing, including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection
with (i) the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by the other
Transaction Documents and (ii) actions to enforce this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee; _provided_ that the
Indemnitee to whom Losses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
Losses if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to
indemnification.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and, if the Company is unable to,
Purchaser shall cause the Company as of the Closing to, obtain and fully pay
the premium for "tail" insurance policies for the extension of (i) the
Managers liability coverage of the Companys existing insurance policies for
the Managers, and (ii) the Companys existing fiduciary and employment
practices liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Closing Date
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys insurance carrier as of the date of this Agreement with respect to
Managers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively,
" _Managers Insurance_ ") with respect to any matters that existed or occurred
at or prior to the Closing (including in connection with this Agreement, the
Transaction or the transactions contemplated by the other Transaction
Documents) with benefits, terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage
that are at least as favorable to the Managers as the Companys existing
policies; _provided_ that the cost of the annual premium amount for such
"tail" insurance policies does not exceed an amount equal to 300% of the
annual premiums

 



      
 

 



 

currently paid by the Company for such insurance. If the Company for any
reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Closing,
Purchaser shall continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
(6) years from and after the Closing the Managers Insurance in place as of the
date of this Agreement with benefits, terms, conditions, retentions and levels
of coverage that are at least as favorable to the insureds as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be required to expend for such
policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300%
of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Purchaser shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(c) If the Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate
with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all its properties and assets to
any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Company shall assume all the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnitees, who are third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.6_.

 



 

(e) The rights of the Indemnitees under this _Section 6.6_ shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnitees may have under the Organizational
Documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable
Contracts or Laws. All rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing and
rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of
any Indemnitee as provided in the Organizational Documents of the Company and
its Subsidiaries or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnitee and
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Transaction and shall
not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnitee.

 



 

6.7 _Access_.

 



 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause the other
members of the Company Group to, (i) afford Purchaser and its Representatives

business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the personnel, properties,
assets and books and records of the members of the Company Group and (ii)
furnish promptly to Purchaser such information concerning the business,
operations, properties, assets, liabilities and personnel of the members of
the Company Group, in each case, as Purchaser may reasonably request;
_provided_ , ___however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no member of
the Company Group shall be required to permit any inspection, or to disclose
any information, that (i) in its reasonable judgment would result in (x) the
disclosure of any trade secrets of any Third Party or the violation of any
confidentiality obligations of any member of the Company Group (solely to the
extent such confidentiality obligation is set forth in a Contract made
available to Purchaser prior to the date hereof with any Third Party or is
contained in a

 



      
 

 



 

Contract entered into after the date hereof that does not purport to be
binding on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates), in each case if reasonable
best efforts to obtain the consent of such Person to such inspection or
disclosure and to make the requested information available in a manner and to
the extent that would not result in disclosure of trade secrets or violation
of confidentiality obligations have been made or (y) the waiver of the
attorney-client privilege by any member of the Company Group ( _it_ _being_
_understood_ that in such event the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to make such information available to Purchaser and its
Representatives in a manner and to the extent that would not result in the
waiver of such attorney-client privilege) or (ii) is set forth in _Section
6.7(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. All such information shall be
treated as "Confidential Information" governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(b) Subject to applicable Law, for six (6) years after the Closing, Purchaser

properties, assets and books and records of the members of the Company Group
and (ii) such information concerning the business, operations, properties,
assets, liabilities and personnel of the Company Group, in each case to the
extent reasonably requested by such Seller primarily for accounting, audit or
tax matters relating to periods prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
___however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be
required to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in its
reasonable judgment would result in (x) the disclosure of any trade secrets of
any member of the Company Group or any Third Party or the violation of any
confidentiality obligations of any member of the Company Group to any Third
Party, in each case if reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such Person
to such inspection or disclosure and to make the requested information
available in a manner and to the extent that would not result in disclosure of
trade secrets or violation of confidentiality obligations have been made or
(y) the waiver of the attorney-client privilege by Purchaser or any member of
the Company Group ( _it_ _being understood_ that in such event Purchaser shall
use its reasonable best efforts to make such information available to such
Seller and its Representatives in a manner and to the extent that would not
result in the waiver of such attorney-client privilege). For a period of
twenty-four (24) months from the date a Seller receives any information
pursuant to this _Section 6.7_, such Seller shall treat such information as
Company Confidential Information governed by the terms of _Section 6.16_
(without regard to any time limitations set forth in _Section 6.16_).

 



 

(c) Purchaser agrees to hold all, and not to destroy or dispose of any, of the

for purposes of determining the amount of or whether any Person is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_.

 



 

(b) Sellers and the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, upon
obtaining actual Knowledge of any event, condition or fact that would cause
any of the conditions to Purchasers obligation to consummate the Transaction
not to be fulfilled, notify Purchaser thereof, and furnish Purchaser any
information it may reasonably request with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) Purchaser shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable, upon obtaining
actual Knowledge of any event, condition or fact that would cause any of the
conditions to the Companys and the Sellers obligation to consummate the

and furnish to each of the Company and the Sellers any information such Person
may reasonably request with respect thereto.

 



 

6.9 _Publicity_. Except as required by applicable Law or by the listing rules

and the Transaction shall be paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of (i) Sellers (each on a several basis
with respect to its Pro Rata Portion), on the one hand, and (ii) Purchaser, on
the other hand, shall be responsible for 50% of any fees, expenses and other
liabilities or obligations payable to the Escrow Agent in respect of the
transactions contemplated by the Deposit Escrow Agreement and the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement, except, in the case of indemnification obligations to the
Escrow Agent, to the extent such obligations arise as the direct result of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or any breach of this Agreement by,
the other party.

 



 

6.11 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter (as subject to modifications
pursuant to the flex provisions, if any, of the Fee Letter and as subject to
modifications and replacements contemplated by the parties to the Commitment

the conditions contemplated by, the Commitment Letter and shall give the
Sellers prompt notice of any event or change that would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect the ability of Purchaser to consummate the Debt Financing.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser agrees to notify
the Sellers promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days: (i) of
obtaining Knowledge of any breach or default that is continuing (or any event
or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or default) by any party to
the Commitment Letter or definitive document related to the Debt Financing (in
a manner that would reasonably be expected to impair the ability of Purchaser
to obtain the Debt Financing); and (ii) of the receipt of any written notice
or other written communication from any person with respect to any: breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter or
any definitive document related to the Debt Financing or any provisions of the

(c) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions, if any) contemplated in the
Commitment Letter (subject to modifications, replacements or reductions (as a
result of an alternative financing or otherwise) as permitted therein),
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event but no later than the
business day immediately prior to the End Date. Purchaser shall keep the
Sellers informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and promptly shall provide
copies of all definitive documents agreed with the Lenders or otherwise
related to the Debt Financing to the Sellers, subject to customary redaction

(d) During the pre-Closing period, upon the request of Purchaser and at
Purchasers sole expense, the Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts
to cause the members of the Company Group and their Representatives to provide
cooperation reasonably requested by Purchaser in connection with Purchasers

participating in meetings and road shows and facilitating direct contact
between the senior management of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their

timely basis information reasonably requested by Purchaser relating to such
financing; (iii) assisting in a timely manner in the preparation of offering

Financing or any other financing relating to the Transaction; and (ix) using

cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or
operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries. None of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of the Sellers shall be required to take any action
that would require it to enter into prior to the Closing, or incur any
obligation that would be effective prior to the Closing Date under, the
Commitment Letter, any other agreement relating to the financing of the
Transaction or the definitive loan documentation for the Debt Financing or to
bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or other similar fee or make
any other payment (other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs) or provide or
agree to provide any indemnity in connection with the Debt Financing or any of
the foregoing prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Sellers and their respective

financing, and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or any written
information provided by the Sellers or the Company Group to Purchaser
specifically for inclusion in offering memoranda, private placement memoranda,
confidential information memoranda and similar documents). Purchaser shall,

(e) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.11(d)_, the Company agrees
as follows:

December 31, 2012 (and shall in any event deliver on or before January 7,
2013) to Purchaser (x) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet and related
consolidated statements of earnings, members equity and cash flows of the
Company and the GAAP Reporting Entities as of September 30, 2012 and for the
nine-month period ending on September 30, 2012 (including for the comparable

specified by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in SAS 100/AU 722),
and (y) the Required Material as of such date.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver on or before
March 8, 2013 (and shall in any event deliver on or before March 15, 2013) to

(iii) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver, with respect
to the financial statements required by this _Section 6.11(e)_ to be
delivered before the Closing Date, the adjustments and other information
reasonably requested by Purchaser regarding the Company that Purchaser would
be required to reflect or include in Purchasers pro forma financial
statements with respect to the Transaction and the CPG Transaction meeting the
applicable requirements of Article 11 of Regulation S-X.

 



 

(iv) The financial statements and other financial information described in the
preceding clauses _(i)_ through _(iii)_ are collectively referred to as the
" _Required Financial Information_ ".

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
6.11_, to the extent Purchaser has made alternate financing arrangements
pursuant to which it has or reasonably expects to have sufficient funds from
other sources available to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement
(including by reason of a capital markets or other financing transaction or
the liquidation of existing portfolio assets), Purchaser shall not be
obligated to comply with the foregoing _Sections 6.11(a)_ through _6.11(c)_
to the extent noncompliance therewith would not, in Purchasers reasonable
judgment, materially increase the risk of Purchaser having insufficient funds
to consummate the Transaction.

 



 

6.12 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
party, each party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, such documents and other instruments and shall take, or cause to be
taken, such further actions (subject to _Section 6.2_), as may be reasonably
required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and to consummate the Transaction.

 



 

6.13 _Non-Solicitation_. The Sellers and the Company shall, effective upon the
execution hereof, terminate any discussions or negotiations regarding any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Other
Bid and shall promptly after the execution hereof request each Person that has
executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of
acquiring the Company and its Subsidiaries or substantially all the business
or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries to return or destroy all
confidential information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of any
member of the Company Group. None of the Sellers shall, nor shall any Seller
authorize or permit any member of the Company Group or any of their respective
Representatives to, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage any Other Bid, (ii)
enter into any binding or nonbinding Contract with respect to any Other Bid or
(iii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to
any Person any information with respect to, or take any other action to
facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Other Bid. Each Seller and the
Company promptly

 



      
 

 



 

shall advise Purchaser orally and in writing of any Other Bid or any inquiry
with respect to or which could lead to any Other Bid and the identity of the
Person making any such Other Bid or inquiry.

(a) From and after the Closing through the second (2nd) anniversary thereof,
no Seller shall, and each Seller shall cause each of its Affiliates (as
defined in _Section 6.17(b)_) not to, directly or indirectly, hire any of the
individuals set forth in _Exhibit N_ unless agreed to in writing by
Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ , that following the twelve month
anniversary of the Closing Date, the foregoing shall not apply to any of the
individuals set forth in _Exhibit N_ that have been terminated by the Company
or any of its Affiliates prior to the commencement of employment discussions
between such Seller or any of its Affiliates and such individuals. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Seller shall be liable for any other Sellers breach of
obligations under this _Section 6.14_.

 



 

(b) Each Seller understands that Purchaser shall be entitled to protect and
preserve the going concern value of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the extent permitted by Law and that Purchaser would not have
entered into this Agreement absent the provisions of this _Section 6.14_.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, _it_ _is_ _understood_ _and_
_agreed_ that the remedy of indemnity payments pursuant to _Article IX_ and
other remedies at law would be inadequate in the case of any breach of the
covenants contained in this _Section 6.14_. Purchaser shall be entitled to
equitable relief, including the remedy of specific performance, with respect
to any breach or attempted breach of such covenants, as contemplated by
_Section 10.12_.

 



 

6.15 _Payoff Letters_. At least three Business Days prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to
Purchaser all the Payoff Letters set forth on _Section 6.15_ of the Company

6.16 _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that the information being provided to it in
connection with the Transaction is subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. Effective

(b) For a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date, each Seller (i)
shall keep confidential, and cause (or, with respect to Third Party
Representatives, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause) its Affiliates
and its and their Representatives to keep confidential, and (ii) shall not
otherwise use for its own benefit or the benefit of any other Person, all
information relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Non-Controlled
JV Entities that is not available to the public on the Closing Date, except,
in each case, for information that (x) becomes available to the public after
the Closing Date other than as a result of a breach of this _Section
6.16(b)_, (y) was or becomes available to such Seller, its Affiliates and/or
its or their Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other
than the Company and/or its Affiliates or its or their Representatives or (z)
is independently developed by such Seller, its

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates and/or its or their Representatives without use of or reliance on
any information relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Non-
Controlled JV Entities that is not available to the public on the Closing Date
(such information referred to in this sentence, excluding information of a
type referred to in clause _(x)_ , _(y)_ or _(z)_ of this sentence, the "
_Company Confidential Information_ "). In the event that any Seller or any of
its Affiliates (or any of their Representatives) is requested or required by
any Governmental Authority to disclose any of the Company Confidential
Information, such Seller or any of its Affiliates will, to the extent
practicable and permitted by Law or regulation, provide the Company with
prompt notice so that the Company may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or remedy is not
obtained, and such Seller or any of its Affiliates (or any of their
Representatives) are, based on written advice from legal counsel to such
Seller or any of its Affiliates, legally compelled to disclose such Company
Confidential Information to any tribunal, such Seller or any of its Affiliates
may, without liability hereunder, disclose to such tribunal only that portion
of the Company Confidential Information that counsel advises such Seller or
any of its Affiliates are legally required to disclose, _provided_ that such
Seller or any of its Affiliates shall exercise their reasonable efforts to
preserve the confidentiality of the Company Confidential Information,
including by cooperating with the Company to obtain an appropriate protective
order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded
to that portion of the Company Confidential Information that is being
disclosed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice to the Company shall not be
required where disclosure is made (i) in response to a request by a
Governmental Authority which is not specifically targeted at the Company or
its Affiliates or (ii) in connection with a routine audit or examination by a
Governmental Authority or auditor and such audit or examination does not
reference the Company or its Affiliates.

 



 

6.17 _Protective Covenants_. (a) For a period of three (3) years from the date
of this Agreement, no Seller shall, and each Seller shall cause its Affiliates
not to:

 



 

(i) engage in any collusive behavior with any Person listed on _Section 6.17_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each, a " _Restricted Person_ ") or any of
their controlled Affiliates as part of a demonstrable and deliberate effort on
the part of such Seller or any of its Affiliates to cause a loss of five
percent (5%) or more in the net present value of the cash flows of the
Companys U.S. servicing business as of the date of such effort (as reasonably
determined in good faith by the Company) through the removal of the Company as
special servicer under any of its pooling and servicing agreement in effect as
of such date, if, as of such date, such Seller or any of its Affiliates owns a
ten percent (10%) or greater equity interest in any Restricted Person or any
of their controlled Affiliates or such Seller or any of its Affiliates
receives material compensation or benefit from any Restricted Person or any of
their controlled Affiliates in return for such effort;

 



 

(ii) purchase any ownership position in any Restricted Person that enables
such Seller or any of its Affiliates to exercise majority voting power in, or
to appoint a majority of the board of directors (or similar governing body)
of, such Restricted Person; or

 



 

(iii) purchase any ownership interest in any Restricted Person and exercise
any negative ownership control that such Seller or any of its Affiliates may
have over any Restricted Person in a manner such Seller or any of its
Affiliates reasonably

 



      
 

 



 

expects, as of the date of such exercise, to result in a loss of five percent
(5%) or more in the net present value of the cash flows of the Companys U.S.
servicing business as of such date (as reasonably determined in good faith by
the Company).

 



 

(b) Solely for purposes of this _Section 6.17_ and _Section 6.14_, (i) the
term "Affiliate", with respect to any Seller, (x) means any entity controlled
by, controlling or under common control with such Seller and (y) shall be
deemed to exclude any portfolio company in which such Seller or any of its
Affiliates invests, directly or indirectly, and with respect to Oaktree, shall
be deemed to further exclude Oaktree PPIP Fund, L.P.; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that solely for purposes of _Section 6.17(a)(ii)_, the exclusion in clause
_(y)_ above shall not apply to any portfolio company of Cerberus or Oaktree
(other than any portfolio company of Oaktree PPIP Fund, L.P.) if, at the time
of any purchase contemplated by _Section 6.17(a)(ii)_, an officer of the
management company of Cerberus or Oaktree, as the case may be, has actual
knowledge of such purchase; (ii) the term "control" means the ability to
exercise majority voting power or to appoint a majority of the board of
directors (or similar governing body) of an entity, in each case, through
equity ownership, contract or otherwise; (iii) the phrase "compensation or
benefit" with respect to any Seller or any of its Affiliates shall be deemed
to exclude any compensation or benefit received by such Seller or any of its
Affiliates in its capacity as a holder of the relevant securities ( _pro rata_
with other holders of such securities) to the extent such holder reasonably
believes the relevant action is in the best interests of the holders of such
securities generally; and (iv) the term "Company" means the Company and its
Affiliates (without giving effect to clause _(i)_ of this _Section
6.17(b)_).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the sole and exclusive
remedy for any breach of the provisions of this _Section 6.17_ shall be the
actual monetary damages incurred and no party shall be entitled to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms of this _Section 6.17_ or to obtain
an injunction to prevent breaches thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, no
Seller shall be liable for any other Sellers breach of obligations under this

6.19 _Indemnity Guarantee in Lieu of Escrowed Funds_. If, by February 15,
2013, a Seller requests that it provide Purchaser at Closing with a guarantee
of a specified Affiliate of the Seller covering the Liabilities of such Seller
under _Section 9.1_ in an amount up to such Sellers Pro Rata Portion of the
Escrowed Funds that would otherwise be held in the Indemnity Escrow Account,
in lieu of leaving that Sellers Pro Rata Portion of the Escrowed Funds in the
Indemnity Escrow Account, and Purchaser in its sole discretion accepts that
request, Purchaser and such Seller shall promptly enter into such amendments
to this Agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser
and such Seller, as shall be necessary to achieve that result in a manner that
does not adversely affect any other Seller. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that Vornado has made the request referred to in this _Section 6.19_
(specifying Vornado Realty L.P. as the party that will execute the relevant
guarantee) and Purchaser has granted that request.

 



      
 

 



 

6.20 _Amendment to Provide for Separate Escrow Accounts or Subaccounts_. No
later than March 1, 2013, the parties to this Agreement shall enter into such
amendments to this Agreement and the form of Indemnity Escrow Agreement, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the parties, as shall be
necessary to provide that each Seller shall have its own escrow account or
subaccount so that an indemnity claim under _Section 9.1(a)(i)_ against any
Seller shall not reduce the amount of the escrow account or subaccount of, or
otherwise adversely affect, any other Seller.

event shall the obligations of any Seller under this _ARTICLE IX_ and
_Section 6.4_ exceed an amount equal to such Sellers Pro Rata Portion of the
Purchase Price and (y) in no event shall this _ARTICLE IX_ cover, nor shall
any Seller be otherwise liable for, any breach of any representation or

indemnification hereunder, (x) the amount of any Losses shall be determined
without duplication of any other Loss for which an indemnification claim has
been made under any other representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement,
and shall be computed net of (i) payments actually recovered by such
indemnified party or any of its Affiliates under any insurance policy with
respect to such Losses (net of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
obtaining such payments), (ii) any prior or subsequent actual recovery by such
indemnified party or any of its Affiliates from any Person with respect to
such Losses (net of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining
such recovery), and (iii) any net

 



      
 

 



 

Tax benefit accruing to such Purchaser Indemnified Party, the Company,
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates on account of such Losses, and
no party or any of its Representatives shall have any right to view or obtain
any Tax Return of such Purchaser Indemnified Party ( _it_ _being_ _agreed_
that such net Tax benefit shall be determined by the Accounting Firm and the
parties shall equally share the expense of such determination); and (y) the
amount of any Losses which are incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Party in
respect of any Subsidiary or Non-Controlled JV Entity of the Company shall be
calculated taking into account in an appropriate manner the proportionate
economic interest held by the Company (directly or indirectly) in such
Subsidiary or Non-Controlled JV Entity. If an indemnified party recovers under
any insurance policy or against another Person with respect to any Losses for
which an indemnifying party has actually made an indemnification payment
pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_, such indemnified party shall promptly pay over
to the indemnifying party the amount so recovered, but not in excess of the
sum of (A) any amount previously paid by the indemnifying party to or on
behalf of the indemnified party in respect of such claim and (B) any amount
expended by the indemnifying party in investigating, pursuing or defending any
claim arising out of, involving or otherwise in respect of such matter. If an
indemnified party has any rights under any insurance policy or against another
Person with respect to any Losses for which an indemnifying party has actually
made an indemnification payment pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_, the
indemnifying party shall be subrogated to such rights to the extent of such
payment; _provided_ that, until the indemnified party recovers the full
payment of the Loss related to such claim, any and all claims of the
indemnifying party against any such insurance company or other Person on
account of said indemnity payment is hereby expressly made subordinate in
right of payment to the indemnified partys rights against such insurance
company or other Person. Without limiting the generality or effect of the
foregoing, each indemnified party and indemnifying party shall duly execute
upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the
subrogation rights detailed herein, and otherwise cooperate in the prosecution
of such claims.

 



 

(vi) The representations and warranties of the parties under this Agreement
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall continue
in full force and effect until the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date,
other than the Sellers Fundamental Representations, the Purchaser Fundamental
Representations and the representations and warranties of the Company set
forth in _Section 3.17_ ( _Tax Matters_ ), which shall continue in full force
and effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (the
date on which a representation or warranty contained herein so expires, the "
_Expiration Date_ " of such representation or warranty).

 



 

(vii) As used in this Agreement, a " _Claims Period_ " shall be the period
after the Closing Date during which any claim for indemnification may be
asserted under this Agreement by an indemnified party. The Claims Periods
under this Agreement shall commence on the Closing Date and shall terminate
(a) with respect to Losses arising with respect to any breach or inaccuracy of
any representation or warranty, on the Expiration Date of such representation
or warranty, (b) with respect to indemnification claims pursuant to _Sections
9.1(a)(ii)(C)_ or _(D)_ , on the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date,
(c) with respect to indemnification claims pursuant to _Section
9.1(a)(ii)(E)_, until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations,

claims pursuant to _Sections 9.1(a)(i)(C)_ , _(D)_ or _(E)_ or _Section
9.1(b)(iii)_, 12 months after the date the indemnified party obtains knowledge
that it is entitled to make such claim and (e) with respect to any breach or
nonperformance of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement, (i) in the case
of any covenant required to be performed at or prior to the Closing, 12 months
after the Closing Date and (ii) in the case of any other covenant, 12 months
after the date the indemnified party obtains knowledge of such breach or
nonperformance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnifying party shall
have been properly notified of a claim for indemnity hereunder prior to the
close of business on the last day of the applicable Claims Period, such claim
shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder
until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. The parties hereto hereby waive and agree not to
assert any right under any statute of limitations or other Law to make an
indemnification claim with respect to any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement after the Claims Period for such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement expires in accordance with this _Section 9.1(d)(vii)_.

 



 

(e) _Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(i) In the event that any Legal Proceedings shall be instituted or that any
claim or demand shall be asserted by any Third Party in respect of which
indemnification may be sought under this _ARTICLE IX_ (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), the indemnified party shall promptly cause written notice of the
assertion of any Third Party Claim of which it has knowledge that such
indemnified party intends to assert is covered by this indemnity to be
forwarded to the indemnifying party. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this _ARTICLE IX_, the failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably
prompt notice of any Third Party Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise
affect the indemnifying partys obligations with respect thereto except to the
extent that the indemnifying party can demonstrate actual loss and prejudice
as a result of such failure. Subject to the provisions of this _ARTICLE IX_,
the indemnifying party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice (which counsel shall be reasonably
acceptable to the indemnified party) and to defend against (including
negotiating or settling) any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against by it hereunder. If the indemnifying party elects to
defend against any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses of which an
indemnified party has provided notice hereunder, it shall within twenty (20)
days following the indemnified partys written notice of the assertion of such
Third Party Claim (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so
requires) notify the indemnified party of its intent to do so; _provided_ that
the indemnifying party must conduct its defense of the Third Party Claim
actively and diligently thereafter in order to preserve its rights in this
regard. The indemnifying party shall not settle such Third Party Claim without
the consent of the indemnified party on a basis that would result in (i) a
finding or admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of
any Person by the indemnified party or any of its Affiliates or that would
have an adverse effect on any other claims made or threatened in writing
against the indemnified party, (ii) any monetary damages that are not paid in
full by the indemnifying party or (iii) the indemnified party not being
completely, finally and unconditionally released in connection with such Third
Party Claim or (iv) the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree
that would restrict the future activity or conduct of the

 



      
 

 



 

indemnified party or any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
indemnifying party shall not be entitled to defend against any Third Party
Claim (and shall be liable for the reasonable expenses incurred by the
indemnified party in defending such Third Party Claim) if (i) the Third Party
Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief or relief other than
monetary damages for which the indemnified party would be entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement that the indemnified party reasonably
determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated
from any related claim for monetary damages for which it would be entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement or (ii) the Third Party Claim is a
criminal, civil or administrative Legal Proceeding brought by a Governmental
Authority, or relates to such a Legal Proceeding, or the underlying facts or
circumstances of which would reasonably be expected to give rise to such a
Legal Proceeding. If such equitable relief or other relief portion of the
Third Party Claim can be so separated from that for monetary damages for which
the indemnified party would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to defend against the
portion relating to monetary damages for which the indemnified party would be
entitled to indemnification under this Agreement. If the indemnifying party
elects not to defend against any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses
of which an indemnified party has provided notice hereunder, or fails to
notify the indemnified party of its election as herein provided, the
indemnified party may defend against such Third Party Claim; _it_ _being_
_understood_ that the indemnified partys right to indemnification for a Third
Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by its defense of such Third Party
Claim. The indemnified party shall not settle a Third Party Claim without the
consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. If the indemnified party defends any Third Party Claim, then such
indemnified party may include the reasonable expenses of defending such Third
Party Claim in its claim for indemnification of Losses. If the indemnifying
party shall defend against any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party may
participate, at its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such indemnified party shall be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the
indemnifying party if in the reasonable view of counsel to the indemnified
party an actual conflict or a potential conflict exists between the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party that would make such separate
representation advisable; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the indemnifying
party shall not be required to pay for more than one such counsel (plus any
appropriate local counsel) for all indemnified parties in connection with any
Third Party Claim. Each party hereto agrees to provide reasonable access to
each other party to such documents and information as may reasonably be
requested in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any
such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(ii) The Sellers shall have the sole right to represent the Companys and each
of its Subsidiaries interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court
proceeding relating to a Tax liability for which the Sellers would be required
to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 6.4(c)_
and that relates solely to a taxable year or period ending on or before the
Closing Date or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date,
and to employ counsel of the Sellers choice at the Sellers expense;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers shall have no right to represent the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries interests in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding unless (1) the Sellers shall have first
notified Purchaser in writing of the Sellers intention

 



      
 

 



 

to do so and of the identity of counsel, if any, chosen by the Sellers in
connection therewith and (2) the Sellers reaffirm (which reaffirmation shall
not, for the avoidance of doubt, expand the Sellers indemnification
obligations under this Agreement) to Purchaser that the Sellers shall be
liable for any Losses relating to Taxes that result from such audit or
proceeding, and (3) at the time Sellers seek to represent the Companys or any
of its Subsidiaries interest in any such audit or proceeding, the amount of
Escrowed Funds (after reduction for all pending claims) along with any other
amounts pledged by Sellers to secure all of Sellers obligations in connection
with such proceeding (collectively, the " _Available Amount_ ") is equal to at
least 80% of the reasonably determined maximum amount of Losses for which
Sellers may be liable hereunder in connection with or arising from such audit
or proceeding (such maximum amount, as determined from time to time, the "
_Maximum Liability Estimate_ "); _provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser and
its Representatives shall have the right to assume sole control from Sellers
in such audit or proceeding at any time after the Available Amount is
determined in good faith by Purchaser to be less than or equal to 50% of the
Maximum Liability Estimate; _provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser and its
Representatives shall be permitted, at Purchasers expense, to be present at,
and participate in, any such audit or proceeding.

 



 

(iii) If the Sellers are prohibited from controlling any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding pursuant to clause (3) of the first proviso
or the second proviso to the first sentence of _Section 9.1(e)(ii)_, the
Sellers shall nevertheless be entitled to control such contest if there are
Sellers with a Pro Rata Portion of at least 50%, each of which either (A) has
a net worth at least equal to $50 million or (B) provides a guarantee for such
Sellers Pro Rata Portion of the Tax at issue from a party with a net worth of
at least $50 million.

 



 

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Sellers nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall be entitled to settle, either administratively or
after the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes which could
adversely affect the Liability for Taxes of Purchaser, the Company, any of the
Companys Subsidiaries or any Affiliate thereof for any period after the
Closing Date unless Sellers have indemnified each Purchaser Indemnified Party
against the effects of any such settlement (including the imposition of income
Tax deficiencies, the reduction of asset basis or cost adjustments, the
lengthening of any amortization or depreciation periods, the denial of
amortization or depreciation deductions, or the reduction of loss or credit
carry forwards) without the prior written consent of Purchaser (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(v) Purchaser shall have the sole right to represent the Companys and each
Subsidiarys interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding
relating to Tax liabilities other than those for which the Sellers have
exercised such right pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)(ii)_ and to employ counsel
of Purchasers choice; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers shall be
permitted, at the Sellers expense, to be present at, and participate in, any
such audit or proceeding to the extent such proceeding could adversely affect
the Sellers liability for Taxes under _Section 6.4(c)_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser shall not be entitled to settle, either administratively
or after the commencement of litigation, any such claim for Taxes without the
Sellers consent (which shall not be

 



      
 

 



 

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Purchaser shall have the sole
right to defend the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any
issue, and settle or compromise any issue, arising in connection with any Tax
audit or administrative or court proceeding to the extent Purchaser shall have
agreed in writing to forego any indemnification under this Agreement with
respect to such issue.

 



 

(vi) Nothing herein shall be construed to impose on Purchaser any obligation
to defend the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any Tax audit or
administrative or court proceeding. Any proceeding with respect to which the
Sellers do not assume control in accordance with _Section 9.1(e)(ii)_ may be
settled or compromised in the discretion of Purchaser, and any such settlement
or compromise shall not affect any Purchaser Indemnified Partys right to
indemnification under this Agreement.

 



 

(vii) If there shall be any conflicts between the provisions of _Section
9.1(e)(i)_ and any other provision of this _Section 9.1(e)_ relating to Tax
contests, the provisions of such other provision of this _Section 9.1(e)_
shall control with respect to Tax contests.

 



 

(f) _Indemnification Procedures_. A claim for indemnification for any matter
not involving a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") may be asserted by
notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought prior to the
applicable Expiration Date, setting forth in reasonable detail the facts
giving rise to such claim (to the extent known) and the amount or estimated
amount (to the extent reasonably estimable) of Losses arising out of,
involving or otherwise in respect of such claim promptly after becoming aware
of such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification
promptly shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the
extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result
of such failure. If the indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified
party within thirty (30) days following its receipt of such notice that the
indemnifying party disputes its liability to the indemnified party, the
indemnifying party will be deemed to have accepted the Direct Claim. If the
indemnifying party rejects all or any part of the Direct Claim, the
indemnified party shall be free to seek enforcement of its rights to
indemnification under this Agreement with respect to such Direct Claim.

 



 

(g) _Mitigation_. The parties shall cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is obligated
to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by making commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability. The
parties agree that no indemnified party shall have any recourse under this
_ARTICLE IX_ for any Losses that such indemnified party would not have
suffered had such indemnified party exercised reasonable commercial efforts to
mitigate such Losses within a reasonable amount of time following the
discovery by such indemnified party of the fact, event or circumstance giving
rise to such Losses.

 



 

(h) _No Punitive or Exemplary Damages_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, in no event shall any party be liable for punitive or
exemplary damages of any kind or nature, regardless of the form of action
through which such damages are sought, in each case, except to the extent
awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction in connection with a Third Party
Claim.

 



       
 

 



 

(i) _Waiver; Exclusive Remedy_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
Representative or Affiliate of any party (or any Representative of any such
Affiliate) in such capacity shall have any personal liability to any party as
a result of the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation in this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement. Each party hereby waives, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to
waive, any claims or other method of recovery, whether based in contract, tort
or strict liability, or under applicable Law, against any such Representative
or Affiliate relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ****
and the other Transaction Documents.

 



 

(ii) Except as set forth in _Sections_ _2.8_ and _6.17_ , the remedies
provided in this _ARTICLE IX_ and _Section 6.4_ and contemplated by _Section
10.12_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties, from and after
the Closing, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement **** and the other Transaction Documents other than in
respect of any claim of, or cause of action arising out of, actual fraud.

 



 

(j) _No Claims Against Company_. No Seller shall have any right to obtain
damages (whether through an action for contribution or otherwise) from any of
the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries or their Representatives with respect
to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder
and each Seller hereby releases, waives and discharges any such rights and all
other rights in connection therewith against the Company, the Companys
Subsidiaries and their Representatives (except for any reimbursements pursuant
to any Benefit Plan or other arrangement in effect at or prior to the Closing
in connection with the Option Holder Payments and Deal Bonuses as a result of
indemnity payments by the Sellers hereunder), other than with respect to
obligations of the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and their
Representatives hereunder to be performed after the Closing.

 



 

(k) _Claims Against the Indemnity Escrow Account_. Purchaser and SCG shall
have the right to notify the Escrow Agent of any claim for indemnification
made by any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 9.1_.
Promptly following the final determination in accordance with this _Section
9.1_ of any claim for indemnification made by any Purchaser Indemnified Party
pursuant to this _Section 9.1_, upon request by Purchaser or SCG, as
applicable, the Sellers shall execute and deliver a certificate requesting the
Escrow Agent to deliver by wire transfer to an account designated by Purchaser
or SCG, as applicable, immediately available funds in the amount of such claim
as finally determined in accordance with this _Section 9.1_ (not to exceed
the amount then held in the Indemnity Escrow Account). A " _final
determination_ " shall exist when (i) the parties to the dispute have reached
an agreement in writing, (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction shall have
entered a final and non-appealable order or judgment, or (iii) an arbitration
or like panel shall have rendered a final non-appealable determination with
respect to disputes the parties have agreed to submit thereto. The right to
receive such distributions from the Indemnity Escrow Account shall be the sole
and exclusive source for indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
for breaches of representations and warranties (other than the Sellers
Fundamental Representations) under this _Section 9.1_ and

 



      
 

 



 

for purposes of the indemnity obligations set forth in _Sections 9.1(a)(i)(C)_
and _(D)_. On the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Escrow
Termination Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Sellers all the
funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account then held by the Escrow Agent by wire
transfer to one or more accounts designated by the Sellers; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if prior to the Escrow Termination Date Purchaser or SCG
notifies the Escrow Agent in writing that all or a portion of the Indemnity
Escrow Account is subject to claims for indemnification under this Agreement
that have not been finally determined (the " _Outstanding Claims_ "), the
amount delivered to the Sellers upon the Escrow Termination Date shall be
equal to the funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account then held by the Escrow
Agent, less the sum of any amounts subject to the Outstanding Claims. If at
any time after the Escrow Termination Date the amount of the Indemnity Escrow
Account then held by the Escrow Agent exceeds the sum of any amounts subject
to the Outstanding Claims, the Sellers and Purchaser or SCG, as applicable,
shall execute and deliver a certificate requesting the Escrow Agent to deliver
such excess amount to the Sellers by wire transfer to one or more accounts
designated by the Sellers.

of any matter, cause or event occurring on or prior to the Closing Date,
including any indemnification or reimbursement obligation of any member of the

or mutual, past, present or future Representatives, successors and assigns

had or may hereafter have to the Company or any other member of the Company
Group arising on or prior to the Closing Date or on account of or arising out
of any matter, cause or event occurring on or prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this _Section 9.3_ shall
operate to release (a) any Liability for fraud or intentional misappropriation
of assets or (b) any obligations of the Sellers, Purchaser, any member of the
Company Group or any of their Representatives arising (i) (A) under this
Agreement (including any certificates delivered by any party hereto in
connection with such partys representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement), (B) under any other Transaction

the one hand, and a Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other, that is not

commenced, any Legal Proceeding of any kind against any Company Releasee based
upon any matter purported to be released hereby and the Company hereby
irrevocably covenants to refrain (and to cause any other member of the Company
Group to refrain) from, directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or demand,
or commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced, any Legal Proceeding of
any kind against any Seller Releasee based upon any matter purported to be
released hereby.

10.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any Exhibits hereto), the
Confidentiality Agreement and the other Transaction Documents constitute the
entire agreement among the parties, and supersede all other prior agreements,
understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral among the
parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

10.7 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Other than as provided in (A) _ARTICLE
IX_ and _Section 6.6_ and (B) _Section 8.2_, _Section 10.1_, _Section
10.4(b)_, this _Section 10.7_ and _Section 10.15_ (which shall be for the
benefit of the Lenders and the Lenders shall have the rights provided for
therein and be third party beneficiaries thereof), this Agreement is not
intended to, and does not, confer any rights or remedies hereunder upon any
Person other than the parties who are signatories hereto, SCG and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. It is understood and agreed that
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein
apply to the CPG Transaction and, as a result thereof, SCG is an express and
intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement, including _ARTICLE IX_,
and that SCG may enforce rights under this Agreement directly as if it were a
signatory to this Agreement.

 



 

10.8 _Obligations of Purchaser and of the Sellers_. Unless otherwise expressly
stated herein, whenever this Agreement requires an Affiliate of a party to
take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on
the part of such party to cause such Affiliate to take such action.

 



 

10.9 _Action by the Sellers_. For purposes of any provision of this Agreement
that contemplates that the Sellers will take any action, such action shall
only be taken by the Sellers upon the approval of such action by the Sellers
representing a majority in Voting Percentage; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Sellers shall only take any action to modify or amend this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 10.1_ or waive any conditions pursuant to _Section
10.2_ upon the approval of such action by the Sellers representing 85% in
Voting Percentage; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the taking of any
action would impact any Seller in a disproportionate manner as compared to the

 



      
 

 



 

other Sellers, such action may only be taken (i) in accordance with the
foregoing requirements and (ii) with the approval of such action by such
Seller.

 



 

10.10 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability.

 



 

10.11 _Interpretation; Construction_.

 



 

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.

 



 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) An item listed or set forth in one section of any Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed to be a listing or setting forth in another section or
sections of such Disclosure Schedule so long as its applicability to the other
section or sections of such Disclosure Schedule or of the Agreement is
reasonably apparent on its face. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such information
and the U.S. dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis
for interpreting the terms "material", "Material Adverse Effect" or other
similar terms in this Agreement.

 



 

10.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision contained in this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its terms and that, prior to the Closing and, with respect to
the covenants set forth in _Sections 6.14_ and _6.16_ , for so long as such
covenants are in place, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction to
prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance
of the terms hereof without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of
monetary damages as a remedy, in addition to any other remedy to which the
parties are entitled. Each party waives any requirement that the party seeking
specific performance post any bond in connection therewith.

 



 

10.13 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other party hereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may without the consent of any Seller
(a) assign any or all its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its
Subsidiaries and designate one or more of its Subsidiaries to perform its
obligations hereunder (in any or all of which cases Purchaser nonetheless
shall remain

 



      
 

 



 

responsible for the performance of all its obligations hereunder), (b) assign
its rights under this Agreement for collateral security purposes to any lender
providing financing to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, and (c) assign
all or a portion of Purchasers rights under this Agreement to acquire
indirect beneficial ownership of the Auction.com Equity Interests to SCG (in
which case the CPG Purchase Agreement shall be automatically amended without
any further action by the parties thereto to provide for the "Purchase Price"
as defined in the CPG Purchase Agreement to be adjusted as instructed by
Purchaser to reflect the assignment of such rights) or to a JV Entity between
Purchaser and SCG or their applicable Affiliates. Any purported assignment of
this Agreement not in accordance with the terms of this _Section 10.13_ shall
be void.

 



 

10.14 _Approval of Transaction_. By their execution of this Agreement, each of
the Company and the Sellers hereby provides its, her or his written consent to
the Transaction and the transactions contemplated by the other Transaction
Documents, including the purchase and sale of Units and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, to the
extent such consent is required by the terms of the Organizational Documents
of the Company, and waives any rights of first refusal, co-sale rights,
purchase option, call option, subscription rights or other similar rights it,
she or he may have pursuant to the Organizational Documents of the Company.

 



 

10.15 _Claims Against Lenders_. Subject to the rights of Purchaser under the
Commitment Letter, none of the parties hereto, nor any of their respective
Affiliates, shall have any rights or claims (whether based in contract, tort,
fraud, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise) against the Lenders or any
Representative or Affiliate thereof (collectively, the " _Debt Financing
Sources_ ") with respect to the Transaction, this Agreement, any related
agreement, the Commitment Letter or any other agreements relating to the
Transaction or the financing for the Transaction or the definitive loan
documentation for the Debt Financing. The Debt Financing Sources, solely in
their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers, shall not have any rights
or claims (whether based in contract, tort, fraud, strict liability, other
Laws or otherwise) against the Sellers or any of their respective
Representatives or Affiliates (other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) or, prior to the Closing, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, with respect to the Transaction, this Agreement, any related
agreement, the Commitment Letter or any other agreements relating to the
Transaction or the financing for the Transaction or the definitive loan
documentation for the Debt Financing; _provided_ that this shall not preclude
enforcement of rights of Purchaser under the Transaction Documents that have
been collaterally assigned to any Debt Financing Source. Without limiting the
foregoing and notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, each
of the parties hereto agrees that it will not, and will not permit any of its
Affiliates to, bring or support any Legal Proceeding (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against a Debt Financing Source or
any Representative or Affiliate thereof in any way relating to financing this
Agreement or the Transaction, including any dispute arising out of or relating
in any way to the Commitment Letter or the performance thereof (other than
rights of the parties under the Commitment Letter against the other parties
thereto). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, in the event any
such Legal Proceeding is commenced in violation of the immediately preceding
sentence, any such Legal Proceeding may not be initiated or continued in any
forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York or in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York (and any appellate court from any thereof). IN FURTHERANCE OF THE
FOREGOING, EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY

 



       
 

 



 

RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH LEGAL
PROCEEDING. EACH SUCH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) SUCH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, AND (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY. The provisions of this _Section 10.15_, as well as
_Section 8.2_, shall be enforceable by each Debt Financing Source, its
Affiliates and their respective successors and permitted assigns as express
third-party beneficiaries.

 



 

10.16 _Claims Generally_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, each party hereby agrees not to initiate any claim under this
Agreement (and, for the avoidance of doubt, no third party beneficiary to any
provision of this Agreement shall have the right to initiate any claim under
this Agreement) at any time after the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing
Date.
