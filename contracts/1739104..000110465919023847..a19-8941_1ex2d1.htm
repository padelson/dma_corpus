ARTICLE III. 
EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK

 



 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, or the holders of
any of the following securities, the following shall occur:

 



 

(i) _Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 3.1(b)_, _Section 3.1(c)_,
_Section 3.1(d)_ and _Section 3.2(e)_, each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Cancelled
Company Shares and any Dissenting Company Shares) shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive (A) 0.1481 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ")
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of Parent common stock ("
_Parent Common Stock_ "), no par value per share (the " _Stock Consideration_
"), _plus_ (B) one contingent value right (a " _CVR_ "), which shall represent
the right to receive a contingent payment upon the achievement of certain
milestones set forth in, and subject to and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of, the Contingent Value Rights Agreement (the " _CVR Agreement_ ")
in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_, _plus_ (C) cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by _Section 3.1(c)_
(the " _Fractional Share Consideration_ ", and together with the Stock
Consideration and CVR, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), which shall be payable
upon the surrender of the certificate evidencing such share of Company Common
Stock in the manner provided in _Section 3.2_ (except in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit in the manner
provided in _Section 3.4_).

 



 

(ii) _Excluded Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock owned by Parent,
Acquisition Sub or the Company, or by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, in each case immediately
prior to the Effective Time (" _Cancelled Company Shares_ "), shall be
cancelled and extinguished without any consideration paid therefor.

 



 

(iii) _Capital Stock of Acquisition Sub_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of Acquisition Sub that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.
Each certificate evidencing ownership of such shares of common stock of
Acquisition Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of shares of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock shall have been

 



     

 

 



 

changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of
any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment, or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend or stock distribution
(including any dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into
Company Common Stock) thereon shall be declared with a record date within said
period, the Exchange Ratio, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly
dependent items, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to provide
the holders of each share of Company Common Stock and Company Stock Award the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 3.1(b)_ shall permit
the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares, and the former holders of such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
shall not be entitled to any voting rights, rights to receive any dividends or
distributions or other rights as a holder of Parent Common Stock with respect
to any such fractional shares that would have otherwise been issued upon the
surrender for exchange of such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. As soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, acting as agent
for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, will
aggregate all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise
have been required to be distributed and cause them to be sold in the open
market for the accounts of such holders at then prevailing prices on the NYSE.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall
receive, in lieu thereof, a cash payment, rounded to the nearest whole cent
and without interest, in an amount equal to the proceeds from such sale by the
Exchange Agent (reduced by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such
sale), in accordance with such holders fractional interest in the aggregate
number of shares of Parent Common Stock sold. Until the proceeds of such sale
or sales have been distributed to the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to receive fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall hold the proceeds in trust for
such holders. As soon as practicable after the determination of the aggregate
Fractional Share Consideration, the Exchange Agent shall make available the
Fractional Share Consideration to such holders, subject to and in accordance
with _Section 3.2_.

 



 

(d) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who shall have
properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal in respect
of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (collectively, " _Dissenting Company Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_. Such Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting

 



     

 

 



 

Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect
or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of
such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall no
longer be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of
the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less any
applicable withholding Taxes pursuant to _Section 3.2(e)_ and without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that
formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided
in _Section 3.2_.

 



 

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisal, or settle any such demands for payment, in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

(e) _Company Options_. Automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i)
the vesting of each outstanding Company Option shall be accelerated in full,
and (ii) each such Company Option shall be net exercised and immediately
cancelled and terminated such that each holder of each such Company Option ("
_Option Holder_ ") shall be entitled to receive the number of shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Net Option Shares_ ") determined by multiplying
the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the
Company Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Net
Exercise Ratio and, subject to _Section 3.1(b)_, _Section 3.1(c)_, and
_Section 3.2(e)_, the Merger Consideration with respect to the Net Option
Shares. With respect to the Net Option Shares, each such Option Holder shall
be treated as a Company Stockholder as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time for purposes of this _Article III_ (including the entitlement to the
Merger Consideration in connection therewith). Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to
effectuate the foregoing, including amending any applicable plans or awards
and seeking any consents and providing any notice to exercise or otherwise as
needed.

 



 

(f) _Company Restricted Stock Awards_. Automatically and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, (i) effective as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the vesting of all outstanding unvested Company Restricted
Stock Awards shall be accelerated in full, (ii) each Company Restricted Stock
Award shall be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time and (iii)
each holder of each such Company Restricted Stock Award shall be entitled to
receive, subject to _Section 3.1(b)_, _Section 3.1(c)_, and _Section
3.2(e)_, with respect to each share of Company Common Stock underlying each
such Company Restricted Stock Award, the Merger Consideration (the "
_Restricted Stock Consideration_ ") and shall be treated as a Company
Stockholder as of immediately prior to the Effective Time for purposes of this
_Article III_ (including the entitlement to the Merger Consideration in
connection therewith). Without

 



      

 

 



 

limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to effectuate the foregoing, including amending any applicable plans
or awards as needed.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Payment of the Merger Consideration._

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange
agent for the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ").

 



 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or
cause to be deposited) with the Exchange Agent, for payment to the Company
Stockholders pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_, the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the aggregate Stock Consideration (for
the avoidance of doubt, including the Restricted Stock Consideration) to which
Company Stockholders are entitled under this _Article III_ (the " _Exchange
Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_ and
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and Fractional Share Consideration and notify the holders of each
CVR contemplated to be issued pursuant to _Section 3.1_.

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a
certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior
to the Effective Time evidenced outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(other than Cancelled Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares), (ii)
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Uncertificated Shares_
"), and (iii) Company Restricted Stock Awards, in each case, who are entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1_, (A) a letter
of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and (B) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article III_ (including instructions for providing
the Exchange Agent required Tax documentation, including, as applicable, a
properly executed IRS Form W-9 or appropriate IRS Form W-8). Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal and Tax documentation, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_,
and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Upon receipt
of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any,
of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) and Tax
documentation, in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares,
the holders of such Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article III_, and the transferred Uncertificated
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Exchange Agent shall
accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated Shares upon compliance
with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal and reasonable
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the

 



     

 

 



 

Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Merger Consideration payable
upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to
this _Section 3.2_. Until so surrendered, Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon,
payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.
As soon as practicable (and in any event within 15 Business Days) following
the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent shall provide Parent with a list of the
names and addresses of all holders of CVRs pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article III_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the payment
of any Milestone Payment (as such term is defined in the CVR Agreement) and
the payment procedures with respect thereto shall be governed by the terms of
the CVR Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books
or ledger of the Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a
name other than that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or
ledger of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so
surrendered is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company
only if such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares is properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer and the Person requesting
such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, or established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated by Parent) that such Taxes
have been paid or are otherwise not payable.

 



 

(e) _Required Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the
contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the CVR
Agreement, as applicable, such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under applicable Laws, including any Tax Laws; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, except (i) with respect to amounts payable with respect to
Company Restricted Stock Awards, (ii) as a result of the failure of the
Company to provide the Non-USRPHC Certificate and Proof of Notice pursuant to
_Section 7.20_ of this Agreement, or (iii) as a result of the failure of any
Company Stockholder to provide applicable Tax documentation to the Exchange
Agent, before making any such deduction or withholding, to the extent
reasonably practicable, Parent shall provide the Company notice of any
applicable payors intention to make such deduction or withholding and provide
the Company with a reasonable opportunity to obtain reduction of or relief
from such deduction or withholding. Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the
Company to obtain such reduction of or relief from such deduction or
withholding. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted, withheld and
remitted to the applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person with respect to which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other Party shall be liable to a Company Stockholder for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, unclaimed property, escheat or similar Law.

 



     

 

 



 

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any Company
Stockholder who has not theretofore surrendered his, her or its Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares evidencing such shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 3.2_ shall thereafter
look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares solely to Parent, as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the
applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant
to the provisions of this _Article III_.

 



 

Section 3.3 _No Further Ownership Rights_. From and after the Effective Time,
all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled, retired and cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any shares of
Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor upon the
surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section 3.2_, or with
respect to Dissenting Company Shares, the right to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Dissenting Company Shares to the extent the holder thereof has not failed to
perfect, withdrawn or otherwise lost the right to appraisal of such Dissenting
Company Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL). From and after the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of
the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers
to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades
effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article III_.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, in the form and
substance as reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent, and the posting by
such holders of a bond in customary and reasonable amount and upon such terms
as may reasonably be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates
with respect to such Certificate, the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to _Section 3.1_.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Necessary Further Actions_. As of the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company
and Acquisition Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and
to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Acquisition Sub,
any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights,

 



     

 

 



 

properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

 



 

ARTICLE IV. 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 



 

Except (i) as disclosed in the letter delivered by the Company to Parent on
the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), or (ii) as
disclosed in any Company SEC Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC after
December 31, 2017, but prior to the date hereof (other than in any "risk
factor" disclosure or any other forward looking statements set forth therein),
and provided that in no event shall any disclosure in any Company SEC Reports
qualify or limit the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in _Section 4.13_ (Tax Matters), the Company hereby represents and warrants
to Parent and Acquisition Sub as follows:

 



 

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly organized and
validly existing and in good standing (to the extent such concepts are
recognized in the applicable jurisdiction) under the Laws of its jurisdiction
of incorporation, with all corporate power and authority to own its properties
and conduct its business as currently conducted, except for such failures to
be in good standing or have such power that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in good
standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do business in each of the
jurisdictions in which the character of the properties owned or held under
lease by it or the nature of the business transacted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified and in
good standing that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The Company has heretofore made available to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent
governing documents) as currently in effect for the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries. Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in
compliance with the terms of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or
equivalent governing documents). Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, owns any interest in any Person, or has
any obligation to acquire any such interest, or to provide funds to or make
any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in
any Person, other than the Companys Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 4.2 _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock. At

Section 6.3 _No Solicitation; Adverse Recommendation Change_.

 



 

(a) The Company agrees that, except as expressly permitted by this _Section
6.3_, until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_, the Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, and the Company shall direct and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives and its Subsidiaries
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (other than with respect to
Parent, Acquisition Sub, or their respective Affiliates and Representatives):
(i) initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage, including by way
of furnishing non-public information, any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer (including any proposal or offer to Company Stockholders)
that constitutes or that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal from any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub and
their respective Affiliates and Representatives); (ii) enter into, engage in,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to any Person (other
than Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives) relating to, any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal, except solely to notify such Person of the existence
of this _Section 6.3_; (iii) agree to, approve, endorse, support, recommend
or consummate any Acquisition Proposal or enter into any letter of intent,

Representatives); or (iv) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing. From
and after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries officers, directors and other
Representatives to, (A) cease and terminate immediately any discussions or

expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (B) terminate access by any
Person (other than the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub and their

Company shall promptly following the date hereof request each Person (other
than Parent) that has theretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in
connection with such Persons consideration of making an Acquisition Proposal
to return (or if permitted by the applicable agreement, destroy) all
information required to be returned (or, if applicable, destroyed) by such
Person under the terms of the applicable agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at any time
following the date of this Agreement and prior to the time that the Required
Stockholder Approval is obtained, (i) the Company receives a written
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board believes in good faith to be bona
fide, (ii) such Acquisition Proposal was unsolicited and did not otherwise
result from a material breach of this _Section 6.3_, and (iii) the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and
its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company may (x)
enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal, (y) furnish information or data with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_ that any non-
public information provided to any such

 



     

 

 



 

Person shall have been previously provided to Parent or shall be provided to
Parent prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person
(or Parent shall be given access to such information) and (z) participate in
discussions, inquiries or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify Parent
in writing of any such determination promptly after the Company Board makes
such determination (and in any event within one (1) Business Day after making
such determination). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
_Section 6.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Company, its Subsidiaries
and its Representatives may, in any event, contact any third party to (i) seek
to clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any inquiry or proposal
made by such third party solely to determine whether such inquiry or proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii)
inform such third party that has made or, to the knowledge of the Company, is
considering making an Acquisition Proposal, of the provisions of this _Section
6.3_.

 



 

(c) Except as expressly permitted by _Section 6.3(d)_, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall:

 



 

(i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent or Acquisition Sub) the
Board Recommendation, (B) recommend or otherwise declare advisable the
approval by the Company Stockholders of any Acquisition Proposal, (C) fail to
include the Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (D) fail to publicly
recommend against any Acquisition Proposal that is a tender offer or exchange
offer within ten (10) Business Days after commencement of such offer, or (E)
resolve or agree to take any such actions set forth in this _Section
6.3(c)(i)_ (each such action, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); or

 



 

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract, except for an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ")
in each case constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is
reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or resolve, agree or
propose to take any such actions.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the time that the Required Stockholder Approval is obtained,
the Company Board shall be permitted, subject to compliance with this _Section
6.3(d)_, (x) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_ to
concurrently enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement and/or
(y) to effect any Adverse Recommendation Change, if, in either case, the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and financial advisors, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided, however_ , that the Company may not make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_ unless:

 



     

 

 



 

(i) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least four (4) Business Days
before taking that action of its intention to do so, and, as applicable, which
notice specifies the reasons therefor, including the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal, the identity of such Person making such
Superior Proposal and a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements
with such Person, or in the case of any Adverse Recommendation Change that is
not related to a Superior Proposal, a reasonably detailed summary of the basis
of such action (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the
material financial terms or any other material term of such Acquisition
Proposal constituting a Superior Proposal (including any revision in the
amount, form or mix of consideration the Company Stockholders would receive as
a result of such potential Superior Proposal) or any material change to the
facts and circumstances relating to the Adverse Recommendation Change shall
require a new written notice by the Company and an additional two (2) Business
Day period); and

 



 

(ii) if Parent makes a proposal during such four (4) Business Day period (or
two (2) Business Day period, if applicable, in accordance with clause (i)
above) to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement (which shall be in
writing in a form that would create a binding contract if accepted by the
Company), the Company Board, after taking into consideration the adjusted
terms and conditions of this Agreement as proposed by Parent, continues to
determine in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor) that such Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior
Proposal or that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement, as applicable, would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law. During the
four (4) Business Day period (or two (2) Business Day period, if applicable,
in accordance with clause (i) above) prior to its effecting an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement as referred to above, the
Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate
with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding
any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
proposed by Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any Alternative
Acquisition Agreement unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with its terms (including the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 9.3(b)_, if applicable).

 



 

(e) From and after the date hereof, the Company, as promptly as reasonably
practicable and in any event within one (1) Business Day of receipt, shall
advise Parent in writing in the event the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Representatives receives (i) any inquiry or request for information,
discussion or negotiation that is reasonably likely to lead to or that
contemplates an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any proposal or offer that is or
is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case together
with a description of the material terms and conditions of and facts
surrounding any such indication, inquiry, request, proposal or offer, the
identity of such Person making such Acquisition Proposal, and a copy of any
written proposal, offer or draft agreement provided by such Person. The
Company shall keep Parent informed (orally and in writing) in all material
respects on a reasonably timely basis of the status and details (including,
within one (1) Business Day after the occurrence of any amendment) of any such
Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry, proposal or offer, including
furnishing copies of any written documentation. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company or

 



     

 

 



 

the Company Board, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from
(i) taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position with respect
to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule
14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Company Stockholders), (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication
to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (iii) making any other communication to the Company
Stockholders if (in the case of this clause (iii)) the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside
legal advisors, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means, other than the Merger or any other
proposal or offer from Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates, any proposal, offer or inquiry from a Person relating to (A) any
acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, of (1) twenty percent (20%) or more of the assets or business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) Company Securities
representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the Company Common Stock; or (B)
any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
Person or group acquiring beneficial ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more
of the Company Common Stock; or (C) any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, share exchange or
other transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which a
Person or its stockholders, if consummated, would acquire twenty percent (20%)
or more of the combined voting power of the Company or the surviving entity or
the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving
entity.

 



 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisor), taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal (including certainty
of closing), the Person making the proposal, and such other factors as the
Company Board considers to be appropriate, would, if consummated, result in a
transaction that is more favorable to Company Stockholders from a financial
point of view than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by
Parent in response to such proposal); provided that, for purposes of this
definition of " _Superior Proposal,_ " references in the term " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " to "20% or more" shall be deemed to be references to "more than
50%."

 



 

(iii) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means (i) any confidentiality
agreement entered into by the Company from and after the date of this
Agreement that contains confidentiality provisions that are not materially
less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that such confidentiality agreement need not
include explicit or implicit standstill provisions that would restrict the
making of or amendment or modification to Acquisition Proposals, or (ii) any
confidentiality agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, it
being understood that the Company, in its sole discretion, shall be entitled
to waive or

 



     

 

 



 

release any preexisting explicit or implicit standstill provisions or similar
agreements with any Person or group of Persons.

in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Further, and for the avoidance of
doubt, neither Company nor Parent will extend any waiting period under the HSR
Act or enter into any agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the
DOJ or any other Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the
other Party.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
promptly inform the other of any communication from any Governmental Authority
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection
with any filings or investigations with, by or before any Governmental
Authority relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any proceedings initiated by a private party. If any Party or an
Affiliate thereof shall receive a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act with
respect to which any such filings have been made, then such Party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other Party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, to the extent reasonably practicable and
unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Authority, the Parties agree to (i) give each other reasonable advance notice
of all meetings and conference calls with any Governmental Authority relating
to the Merger, (ii) give outside counsel for each other an opportunity to
attend and participate in each of such meetings and conference calls, (iii)
keep the other Party reasonably apprised with respect to any oral
communications with any Governmental Authority regarding the Merger, (iv)
cooperate in the filing of any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions or other written communications explaining or defending
the Merger, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument and/or
responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental Authority, (v)
provide each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment
upon, and consider in good faith the views of the other with respect to, all
written communications (including any analyses, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments and opinions) with a Governmental Authority regarding the
Merger, (vi) provide each other (or outside counsel of each Party, as
appropriate) with copies of all written communications to or from any
Governmental Authority relating to the Merger and (vii) cooperate and provide
each other with a reasonable opportunity to participate in, and consider in
good faith the views of the other with respect to, all material deliberations
with respect to all efforts with respect to the foregoing actions. Any such
disclosures, rights to participate or cooperate or provisions of information
by one Party to the other may be made on an outside counsel-only basis to the
extent required under applicable Law or as determined by the Parties outside
counsel, and provided further that any written materials may be, as
applicable, redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company or to comply with contractual requirements, or withheld to address
reasonable privilege concerns.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one
another in good faith to (i) promptly determine whether any filings not
contemplated by _Section 7.4(a)_ are required to be or should be made, and
whether any other consents, approvals, permits or authorizations not
contemplated by _Section 7.4(a)_ are required to be or should be obtained,
from any Governmental Authority under any other applicable Law in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) promptly make any filings,
furnish information required in connection therewith and seek to obtain timely
any such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers that the
Parties determine are required to be or should be made or obtained in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. None of the Company, on the
one hand, or Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall issue (or
shall cause its Affiliates or Representatives to issue) any public release or
make any public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as such release or announcement is required by applicable Law or the
applicable rules or regulations of NASDAQ or the NYSE, in which case the Party
required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow the other Party or Parties a reasonable opportunity to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance,
considering in good faith all comments timely received from the other Party or
Parties (it being understood that the final form and content of any such
release or announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or
announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing Party);
_provided, however_ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.5_
shall not apply to any release or announcement made or proposed to be made (a)
by the Company with respect to an Adverse Recommendation Change effected in
accordance with _Section 6.3(d)_ or as described in _Section 6.3(e) _and (b)
by Parent with respect to the issuance by the Company of any press release or
other public statement of the type referred to in clause (a) of this _Section
7.5_.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover
or other similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and
Company Board shall grant such approval and take such action as necessary so
that such transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided, however,_ that
nothing in the foregoing shall be interpreted to require the Company Board to
take any action that would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing on the date
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Effective Time, the
Company shall afford Parent, Acquisition Sub, their officers, their employees
and their financial advisors, business consultants, legal counsel, accountants
and other agents and representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours, upon reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records,
contracts, analyses, tax returns, data, regulatory materials, reports,
projections, plans, systems, senior management, commitments, offices and other
facilities, properties and personnel of the Company; _provided, however_ ,
that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or

 



     

 

 



 

information to the extent legal counsel for the Company reasonably determines
that (a) any applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise
prohibit access to such documents or information, (b) granting such access
would violate any obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to confidentiality to any Person or otherwise breach, contravene or
violate any then effective Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, or (c) access to such documents or information that
may be subject to any attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or
other applicable privilege applicable to such documents or information. In the
event that the Company does not provide access or information in reliance on
the preceding sentence, it shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is
withholding such information or documents pursuant to clause (a) through (c)
above, as applicable, and thereafter use its reasonable best efforts to
communicate the applicable information to Parent in a way that would not
violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or waive such a privilege.
Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
_Section 7.7_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries
or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to the Companys
reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and shall not include
the right to perform invasive testing without the Companys prior written
consent, in its sole discretion. The terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information obtained by Parent or
any of its financial advisors, business consultants, legal counsel,
accountants and other agents and representatives in connection with any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
7.7_. Nothing in this _Section 7.7_ shall be construed to require the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Representatives of any of the
foregoing to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other
information. No investigation pursuant to this _Section 7.7_ will affect any
of the representations or warranties of the Parties contained in this
Agreement or prejudice the rights and remedies of Parent or Acquisition Sub
hereunder solely as a result of such investigation.

 



 

Section 7.8 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
"derivative securities" (as defined in Rule 16a-1(c) under the Exchange Act))
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its

and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under (i) the indemnification agreements between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former
directors and officers and any person who becomes a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Indemnified Persons_ "), and (ii) indemnification, expense advancement and
exculpation provisions in any certificate of incorporate or bylaws or
comparable organizational

 



     

 

 



 

document of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of
this Agreement, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law. In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving

shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective
Time to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar
organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as

exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are no less favorable than
the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions
contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar
organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof, and during such six (6) year period, such provisions shall not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by
applicable Law or as provided below.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section 7.9(a)_,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the

connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or
pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged
action or omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action or omission,
occurred prior to or at the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, during the period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective
Time to) advance, prior to the final disposition of any claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought under this
Agreement, promptly following request by an Indemnified Person therefor, all
costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
investigation expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with
any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry upon receipt of an
undertaking by such Indemnified Person to repay such advances if it is
ultimately decided in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification
hereunder. If, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice
asserting in good faith a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses
under this _Section 7.9(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice shall
survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as
such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have
the right to control the defense thereof after the Effective Time, (ii) each
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel, whether
or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any

any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, and (iv) no Indemnified
Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or her prior
express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this _Section 7.9(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Surviving
Corporation nor any of its Affiliates (including Parent) shall settle or
otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry
for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person under this
Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes
an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising
out of such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry.

 



 

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect directors
and officers liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by the Companys

Parent may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound
carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts containing term and
conditions which are no less advantageous) (" _Current Company D andO
Insurance_"), on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts that are no
less favorable than those of the Current Company DandO Insurance; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under this _Section 7.9(c)_,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the annual amount
paid by the Company for coverage during its current coverage period (such two
hundred fifty percent (250%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ");
_provided, further,_ that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with, in Parents and the Surviving Corporations good faith
judgement, the greatest coverage available for the Maximum Annual Premium.
Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six (6) year "tail"
prepaid policy on the Current Company DandO Insurance; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the annual premiums paid for such prepaid policies does not exceed the
Maximum Annual Premium. In the event that the Company elects to purchase such
a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail"
policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective
obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this _Section 7.9(c)_ for
so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and effect.

 



 

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any of its
successors or assigns) (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set

under this _Section 7.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Person unless (x) such

Indemnified Persons shall have consented in writing to such termination or
modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Persons shall be
third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.9_).

aggregate to the base salary or wage rate, as applicable, annual cash bonus
opportunity, and other compensation and benefits (to the extent made available
to or known by Parent) provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, a Continuing Employees
employment shall be at will, and the Surviving Corporation may terminate the
employment of a Continuing Employee for any reason at any time (subject to the
terms of any applicable employment agreement). In the event that a Continuing
Employees employment is terminated, all obligations with respect to such
employee under this _Section 7.10(b)_ shall cease.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to provide, each Continuing

of service is relevant, under any employee benefit plans, arrangements and
employment-related entitlements (including under any applicable 401(k),
savings, medical, dental, life insurance, vacation, long-service leave or
other leave entitlements, severance or separation pay plans, but excluding
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) provided, sponsored,
maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to the same
extent recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the Plans;
_provided, however_ , that such service need not be credited to the extent
that it would result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall (or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) ensure that (i) each
Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all employee benefit plans sponsored by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their Subsidiaries in which the

 



     

 

 



 

Continuing Employees participate to the extent coverage under any such plan
replaces coverage under a comparable Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participates immediately before the Effective Time, (ii) for purposes of each
plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability
benefits to any Continuing Employee, all waiting periods, pre-existing
condition exclusions, evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-
work or similar requirements of such plan will be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents, and full credit will be given for
any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents during any unfinished portion of the plan year ending on
the date such employees participation in the corresponding new plan begins
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such new plan, and (iii) the accounts of such
Continuing Employees under any new plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation

unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee under the applicable

provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason, or (ii)
require the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any Plan
or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof. The provisions
of this _Section 7.10_ are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no
Continuing Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be

persons.

shall take all actions reasonably necessary to cause the Holders
Representative to authorize, execute and deliver the CVR Agreement at or prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company does not
select a Holders Representative prior to the Effective Time, then the Parties

consummated by such time;

 



 

(c) by either Parent or the Company if there exists any Restraint that has
become final and non-appealable;

 



 

(d) by either Parent or the Company if the Required Stockholder Approval shall

breached or otherwise violated any of their respective covenants or
agreements, or other obligations under this Agreement, or any of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Acquisition Sub set forth in this
Agreement shall be inaccurate, which breach, violation or inaccuracy,
individually or in the aggregate with other such breaches, violations or
inaccuracies, would cause either of the conditions set forth in _Section
8.3(a)_ or _Section 8.3(b)_ to fail, and (ii) such breach, violation or
inaccuracy described in clause (i) is not cured or is not capable of being
cured by the earlier of (A) the Termination Date and (B) thirty (30) days

(f) by Parent, if (i) the Company shall have breached or otherwise violated
any of its covenants or agreements or other obligations under this Agreement,
or any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this

inaccuracy described in clause (i) is not cured or is not capable of being
cured by the earlier of (1) the Termination Date and (2) thirty (30) days

Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_ shall be effective upon delivery written
notice of termination by the terminating Party to the other Party or Parties,
which shall specify the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such

pursuant to _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect without liability of any Party or Parties, as applicable (or any
director, officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or other representative of such
Party or Parties), to the other Party or Parties hereto, as applicable, except
(a) for the terms of this _Section 9.2_, _Section 9.3_ and _Article X_,
each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (b) that
nothing herein shall relieve any Party or Parties, as applicable, from any
liability or damages hereby resulting from any willful or intentional material
breach of this Agreement that occurs prior to such termination, in which case
the aggrieved Party shall be entitled to all remedies available at Law or in
equity. In addition to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement shall
affect the obligations of the Parties set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination of this
Agreement in accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary provided in this Agreement, including in the foregoing provisions of
this _Section 9.2_, nothing shall relieve any Party for its fraud that occurs
prior to the date of termination, in which case the aggrieved Party shall be
entitled to all remedies available at Law or in equity.

principal cause of or directly resulted in the failure to hold such Company
Stockholders Meeting); (2) following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, a bona fide

 



     

 

 



 

Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or shall have become
publicly disclosed and, in either case, shall not have been withdrawn or
otherwise abandoned; and (3) within twelve (12) months following such
termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive agreement
with any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates) with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (which need not be the
same Acquisition Proposal described in clause (2) above) that is later
consummated (for purposes of the foregoing, each reference to "20% or more" in
the definition of " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall be deemed to be a reference
to "more than 50%");

 



 

(B) by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_; or

 



 

(C) by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_.

 



 

(ii) If the Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to this _Section
9.3(b)_, the Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent by wire transfer

qualifying Acquisition Proposal in the event of payment pursuant to _Section
9.3(b)(i)(A)_, (B) substantially concurrently with such termination, in the
event of payment pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)(i)(B)_ or (C) within two (2)
Business Days of such termination, in the event of payment pursuant to
_Section 9.3(b)(i)(C)_. The payment by the Company of the Termination Fee

circumstances requiring the payment of a Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section 9.3(b)_.

 



 

(c) _Single Payment Only_. The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one (1) occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable under more
than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the
occurrence of different events.

 



 

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. Except as expressly provided in _Section 3.2(d)_, all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes
and fees incurred in connection with the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by Parent and Acquisition Sub when due.

Section 10.3 _Assignment_. No Party may assign (by operation of Law or
otherwise) either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or
obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other Parties.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment in violation of
this Agreement will be void _ab initio_.

 



 

Section 10.4 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company
hereby acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed a
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of September 26, 2018 (as amended, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which will continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any schedules,
annexes and exhibits hereto) and the documents and instruments and other
agreements among the Parties as contemplated by or referred to herein,
including the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter and the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties (except the
Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties hereto
or their respective successors and assigns any rights, remedies obligations or
liabilities hereunder, except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms

in _Article III_.

 



 

Section 10.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties, so long as either the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any Party. The Parties further agree to
negotiate in good faith in an effort to replace such void or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will
achieve, to the maximum extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 10.8 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein (including in _Section 9.3_), any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 



 

(b) The Parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event of any
breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and/or
Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or
obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement, by the other (as applicable), and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other under this Agreement. The Company, on the one hand,
and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand hereby agree not to raise
any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by such Party (or Parties), and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such Party
(or Parties) under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, INTERPRETED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THAT
WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANY OTHER STATE OR WOULD DIRECT
A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and
only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior
Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject
matter jurisdiction over the matter that is the subject of the action or
proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of
America, the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the
district of Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto,
and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not
to commence any such action or proceeding except in the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware (Complex
Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the matter that
is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested exclusively in the
federal courts of the United States of America, the federal court of the
United States of America sitting in the district of Delaware, as applicable,
and any appellate court from any thereof, (ii) agrees that any claim in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard

 



     

 

 



 

and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and
only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior
Court of the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject
matter jurisdiction over the matter that is the subject of the action or
proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of
America, the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the
district of Delaware, as applicable, and any appellate court from any thereof,
(iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the jurisdiction or laying of
venue of any such action or proceeding in such courts and (iv) waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in such courts. Each of the Parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process inside or outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this _Section 10.9_, in the manner
provided for notices in _Section 10.2_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect
the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner
permitted by Law.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY A JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE MERGER AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _Section
10.9_.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at
any time prior to the Effective Time by execution of an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to
the Effective Time, any Party or Parties may, to the extent legally allowed
and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party or
Parties, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties made to such Party or Parties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions for the benefit of such Party or Parties contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a Party or Parties to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such Party or Parties, as applicable. Any delay in exercising any right
under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right. No single or
partial exercise of any such extension or

 



      

 

 



 

waiver, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such
extension or waiver, or any course of conduct, shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other extension or waiver. The
conditions to each of the Parties obligations to consummate the Merger are
for the sole benefit of such party and may be waived by such Party in whole or
in part to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 10.12 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company acknowledges that each Party to this Agreement
has been represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or
any legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed
ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting Party has no application
and is expressly waived.

 



 

Section 10.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Party, it being understood that all
Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other
electronic transmission, including by e-mail attachment, shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

WHEREAS, the parties have done all things necessary to make the CVRs, when
issued pursuant to the Merger Agreement and hereunder, the valid obligations
of Parent and to make this Agreement a valid and binding agreement of Parent,
in accordance with its terms.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
consummation of the transactions referred to above, it is mutually covenanted
and agreed, for the proportionate benefit of all Holders, as follows:

with such Person. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, the term
"control" (including, with correlative meanings, the terms "controlling,"
"controlled by" and "under common control with"), as used with respect to any
Person, means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct
or cause the direction of the management and policies of such Person, whether
through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

 



 

" _Assignee_ " has the meaning set forth in _Section 6.1_.

Milestone, carrying out those obligations and tasks in good faith and in a

devoted by a company, in the exercise of its commercially reasonable
discretion, within the pet therapeutics industry of comparable size and
resources to the Company, relating to development of, seeking regulatory
approval of or commercializing, as applicable, a similar product or product
candidate, as applicable, at a similar stage in its development or product
life as the applicable Product, taking into account, without limitation,
issues of safety and efficacy, market potential, anticipated pricing and
reimbursement rates, costs, expected profitability (including development
costs, intellectual property defense costs, distribution and logistics and all
other costs associated with the applicable Product), labeling, pricing
reimbursement, methods of distribution, the competitiveness of alternative

purposes hereof, "Competing Product" means any product that may reasonably be
deemed to compete with the

 



     

 

 



 

Product. For the avoidance of doubt, a failure to achieve the Milestone may
still be consistent with Diligent Efforts.

connection with a Product that is intended for use to enhance or facilitate
the delivery of such Product via a specific route of administration. For
clarity, Drug Delivery Systems shall not include any formulation technology

Representative (or, as applicable, the successor thereof).

 



 

" _Imputed Net Sales_ " means, if the Closing Date is after September 1, 2019,

period from the Closing Date to the end of the First Sales Measurement Period,
_divided by_ (B) the number of days in the period from the Closing Date to the

days from September 1, 2019 to the Closing Date, _minus_ (ii) the cumulative
Net Sales of the Product in the period from September 1, 2019 to the Closing

Representative.

" _Milestone_ " means the first occurrence and only the first occurrence of
either (i) the sum of (A) the cumulative Net Sales of the Product during the
First Sales Measurement Period, _plus_ (B) the Imputed Net Sales (if any)
equaling or exceeding $25,000,000, or (ii) the sum of (A) the cumulative Net
Sales of the Product during the Second Sales Measurement Period, _plus_ (B)

the Milestone Payment and (b) the number of CVRs held by such Holder as
reflected on the CVR Register as of the close of business on the date of the
applicable Milestone Achievement Certificate (or if, in accordance with
Section 4.4, the Independent Accountant prepares a Final Shortfall Report that
concludes that the Milestone Payment should have been paid but was not paid
when due, as of the close of business on the date of the Final Shortfall
Report, as the case may be).

 



 

" _Milestone Payment Date_ " means the date that is forty-five (45) days
following the last day of the applicable Sales Measurement Period.

 



 

" _Net Sales_ " means the gross amount invoiced by the Selling Entities
(without double counting) to third parties other than any other Selling Entity
(except as provided below), for the Product, less (without double counting):

 



 

(1) trade, quantity and cash discounts allowed;

 



 

(2) discounts, refunds, rebates, chargebacks, retroactive price adjustments,
and any other allowances which effectively reduce the net selling price;

 



 

(3) product returns and allowances;

 



 

(4) that portion of the sales value associated with Drug Delivery Systems;

 



 

(5) any tax imposed on the production, sale, delivery or use of the Product,
including, without limitation, sales, use, excise or value added taxes;

 



 

(6) wholesaler inventory management fees;

 



     

 

 



 

(7) allowance for distribution expenses (other than distribution expenses
incurred by any Selling Entity); and

 



 

(8) any other similar and customary deductions which are in accordance with
GAAP (collectively, the " _Permitted Deductions_ ").

 



 

Such amounts shall be determined from the books and records of such Selling
Entity, maintained in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, and using
Parents then current standard procedures and methodology, including Parents
then current standard exchange rate methodology for the translation of foreign
currency sales into U.S. Dollars, consistently applied.

 



 

In the case of any sale of the Product between or among any of the Selling
Entities for resale, Net Sales shall be calculated as above only on the value
charged or invoiced on the first bona fide arms-length sale thereafter to a
third party, less the Permitted Deductions; _provided_ , _however_ that, where
the purchasing Selling Entity is an end-user of, and does not further sell,
the Product, Net Sales shall be calculated on the value charged or invoiced to
such purchasing Selling Entity, less the Permitted Deductions, in each case as
determined in accordance with the foregoing paragraph. If a Product is sold or
otherwise commercially disposed of for consideration other than cash or in a
transaction that is not at arms length between the buyer of such Product and
the applicable Selling Entity, then the gross amount to be included in the
calculation of Net Sales shall be the amount that would have been received had
the transaction been conducted at arms length and for cash. Such amount that
would have been received shall be determined, wherever possible, by reference
to the weighted average selling price of such Product in arms length
transactions as defined below.

 



 

In the event that the Product is sold as part of a Combination Product (a "
_Combination Sale_ "), the Net Sales of the Product shall be determined by
multiplying the Net Sales of the Combination Product by the fraction, A /
(A+B) where A is the weighted average sale price of the Product when sold
separately in finished form, and B is the weighted average sale price of the
other product(s) sold separately in finished form.

 



 

In the event that the weighted average sale price of the Product can be
determined but the weighted average sale price of the other product(s) cannot
be determined, Net Sales shall be calculated by multiplying the Net Sales of
the Combination Product by the fraction A / C where A is the weighted average
sale price of the Product when sold separately in finished form and C is the
weighted average sale price of the Combination Product.

 



 

In the event that the weighted average sale price of the other product(s) can
be determined but the weighted average sale price of the Product cannot be
determined, Net Sales shall be calculated by multiplying the Net Sales of the
Combination Product by the following formula: one (1) minus (B / C) where B is
the weighted average sale price of the other product(s) when sold separately
in finished form and C is the weighted average sale price of the Combination
Product.

 



 

In the event that the weighted average sale price cannot be determined for the
Product and all other product(s) included in the Combination Product, Net
Sales shall be deemed to be equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Net Sales of
the Combination Product.

 



     

 

 



 

The weighted average sale price for a Product, other product(s), or
Combination Product shall be calculated once each calendar year, and such
weighted average sale price shall be used for such Product, other product(s),
or Combination Product during that applicable calendar year. When determining
the weighted average sale price of a Product, other product(s), or Combination
Product, the weighted average sale price shall be calculated by dividing the
sales dollars (translated into U.S. dollars) of such Product, other
product(s), or Combination Product by the units of such Product, other
product(s), or Combination Product sold during the twelve (12) months (or the
number of months sold in a partial calendar year) of the preceding calendar
year for the respective Product, other product(s), or Combination Product. In
the initial calendar year that such Product, other product(s), or Combination
Product is sold, a good-faith forecasted weighted average sale price
determined by Parent will be used for the Product, other product(s), or
Combination Product.

 



 

" _Net Sales Statement_ " means, with respect to each Sales Measurement
Period, the written statement of Parent, certified by the Chief Financial
Officer of Parent, setting forth with reasonable detail:

 



 

(1) a delineation and calculation of the cumulative worldwide Net Sales of the
Product during such Sales Measurement Period;

 



 

(2) a delineation and calculation of the Imputed Net Sales (if any);

 



 

(3) a delineation and calculation of the Permitted Deductions recorded during
such Sales Measurement Period;

 



 

(4) to the extent that Combination Sales are recorded in the cumulative
worldwide Net Sales of the Product during such Sales Measurement Period, the
method of determining the Net Sales of the Combination Product attributable to
the Product in accordance with the definition of Net Sales; and

 



 

(5) to the extent that sales for the Product for such Sales Measurement Period
are recorded in currencies other than United States dollars, the exchange
rates used for conversion of such foreign currency into United States dollars.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, the amounts in the Net Sales Statement shall be
calculated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including the
definitions of "Net Sales" and "Permitted Deductions" contained herein.

 



 

" _Officer s Certificate_" means a certificate signed by the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of Parent, in their respective
official capacities.

 



 

" _Parent Sale Transaction_ " has the meaning set forth in _Section 6.1_.

 



 

" _Permitted Transfer_ " means a Transfer of one or more CVRs (1) upon death
of a Holder by will or intestacy; (2) by instrument to an _inter vivos_ or
testamentary trust in which the CVRs are to be passed to beneficiaries upon
the death of the trustee; (3) made pursuant to a court order of a court of
competent jurisdiction (such as in connection with divorce, bankruptcy or
liquidation); (4) made by operation of law (including a consolidation or
merger) or without

 



     

 

 



 

consideration in connection with the dissolution, liquidation or termination
of any corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other entity;
(5) if the Holder is a partnership, in a distribution from the transferring
partnership to its partners or former partners in accordance with their
partnership interests; (6) in the case of CVRs payable to a nominee, from a
nominee to a beneficial owner (and, if applicable, through an intermediary) or
from such nominee to another nominee for the same beneficial owner, in each
case as permitted by DTC; or (7) as provided in _Section 2.6_.

 



 

" _Person_ " means any individual, corporation (including any non-profit

liability company or joint stock company), firm or other enterprise,
association, organization, entity or Governmental Authority.

 



 

" _Product_ " means any animal health product that contains capromorelin as an
active pharmaceutical ingredient or combination of co-administered animal
health products that each contain capromorelin as an active pharmaceutical
ingredient, in each case alone or in combination with one or more additional

extensions thereof; for clarity, however, a Product that includes one or more
additional active pharmaceutical ingredient will be, if sold, a Product that
is sold as part of a Combination Product.

Agreement, until a successor Rights Agent shall have been appointed pursuant

Transfer or if a Holder is abandoning its CVRs pursuant to _Section 2.6_. Any
attempted Transfer that is not a Permitted Transfer, in whole or in part, will
be void _ab initio_ and of no effect.

 



 

Section 2.3 _No Certificate; Registration; Registration of Transfer; Change of
Address._

 



 

(a) Holders rights and obligations in respect of CVRs derive solely from this
Agreement; CVRs will not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument.

 



 

(b) The Rights Agent will maintain an up-to-date register (the " _CVR
Register_ ") for the purposes of the registration of the CVRs and Permitted
Transfers thereof in a book-entry position for each Holder. The CVR Register
shall set forth the name and address of each Holder, the number of CVRs held
by such Holder, and the U.S. federal tax identification number of each Holder.
The CVR Register will initially show one position for Cede and Co. representing
all the shares of Company Common Stock held by DTC on behalf of the street

 



     

 

 



 

holders of the shares of Company Common Stock held by such holders as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) Subject to the restriction on transferability set forth in _Section 2.2_,
every request made to Transfer CVRs must be in writing and accompanied by a
written instrument of Transfer duly executed and properly completed, as
applicable, by the Holder or Holders thereof, or by the duly appointed legal
representative, personal representative or survivor of such Holder or Holders,
setting forth in reasonable detail the circumstances relating to the Transfer.
Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights Agent will, subject to its
reasonable determination in accordance with its own internal procedures, (i)
determine if (A) the Transfer instrument is in proper form, (B) the Transfer
is a Permitted Transfer and (C) the Transfer otherwise complies on its face
with the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, and, if so (ii)
register the Transfer of the applicable CVRs in the CVR Register. All
Transfers of CVRs registered in the CVR Register will be the valid obligations
of Parent, evidencing the same right, and entitling the transferee to the same
benefits and rights under this Agreement, as those held by the transferor. No
Transfer of CVRs shall be valid until registered in the CVR Register in
accordance with this Agreement and any Transfer not duly registered in the CVR
Register shall be void.

 



 

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent to change such
Holders address of record in the CVR Register. Such written request must be
duly executed by such Holder. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights
Agent shall promptly record the change of address in the CVR Register.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Payment Procedures._

 



 

(a) If the Milestone occurs prior to the expiration of a Sales Measurement
Period, then, on or prior to the Milestone Payment Date, Parent, will (i)
deliver to the Rights Agent and the Holders Representative, an Officers
Certificate certifying the date of the occurrence of the Milestone and that
the Holders are entitled to receive the Milestone Payment (the " _Milestone
Achievement Certificate_ "), (ii) deliver any letter of instruction reasonably
required by the Rights Agent and (iii) deposit with the Rights Agent, in trust
for the benefit of the Holders, the aggregate amount necessary to pay the
Milestone Payment Amount to each Holder. As promptly as practicable after the
Rights Agents receipt of the Milestone Achievement Certificate, any letter of
instruction reasonably required by the Rights Agent and the aggregate amount
necessary to pay the Milestone Payment Amount to each Holder (and in any
event, within ten (10) Business Days after receipt), the Rights Agent shall
(A) deliver, or cause to be delivered, by first-class postage prepaid mail, to
each Holder at the address of such Holder set forth in the CVR Register as of
the close of business on the date of the Milestone Achievement Certificate, a
copy of the Milestone Achievement Certificate and (B) pay or cause to be paid,
by check delivered by first-class postage prepaid mail, to each Holder at the
address of such Holder set forth in the CVR Register as of the close of
business on the date of the Milestone Achievement Certificate, the Milestone
Payment Amount payable to such Holder, less any applicable withholding
pursuant to _Section 2.4(d)_.

 



 

(b) If the Milestone has not occurred prior to the expiration of a Sales
Measurement Period then, on or before the date that is forty-five (45) days
after the end of such Sales Measurement Period, Parent will deliver to the
Rights Agent and the Holders

 



     

 

 



 

Representative (i) an Officers Certificate certifying that the applicable
Milestone has not occurred in the immediately preceding Sales Measurement
Period and that Parent has complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this Agreement (the " _Milestone Non-Achievement
Certificate_ "), and (ii) the Net Sales Statement for such Sales Measurement
Period. The Rights Agent will promptly (and in any event, within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt) deliver, or cause to be delivered, by first-class
postage prepaid mail, to each Holder at the address of such Holder set forth
in the CVR Register as of the close of business on the date of the Milestone
Non-Achievement Certificate, a copy of such Milestone Non-Achievement
Certificate and the Net Sales Statement for such Sales Measurement Period. The
Rights Agent will deliver to Parent a certificate certifying the date of
delivery of such certificate to the Holders.

 



 

(c) Except to the extent any portion of any Milestone Payment Amount is
required to be treated as imputed interest pursuant to applicable Law, the
parties hereto agree to treat any Milestone Payment Amount as additional
consideration for the shares of Company Common Stock for all U.S. federal and
applicable state and local income Tax purposes. The parties hereto will not
take any position to the contrary on any Tax Return except as required by
applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Parent and the Rights Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause to be deducted and withheld, from any Milestone Payment Amount otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
applicable Law relating to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Holder in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made and, in no event shall either
Parent or the Rights Agent be obligated to pay additional amounts in respect
of any such deduction or withholding. Prior to making any such Tax deductions
or withholdings or causing any such Tax deductions or withholdings to be made
with respect to any Holder, the Rights Agent will, to the extent reasonably
practicable, provide notice to the Holder of such potential Tax deduction or
withholding and a reasonable opportunity for the Holder to provide any
necessary Tax forms in order to avoid or reduce such withholding amounts;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the time period for payment of a Milestone
Payment Amount by the Rights Agent set forth in _Section 2.4(a)_ will be
extended by a period equal to any delay caused by the Holder providing such
forms, _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall such period be extended
for more than ten (10) Business Days, unless specifically requested by the
Holder for the purpose of delivering such forms and agreed to by the Rights
Agent in its sole discretion. Except as provided in this _Section 2.4(f)_,
none of Parent or any of its Affiliates shall have any right to set off any
amounts owed or claimed to be owed by any Holder to any of them against such
Holders Milestone Payment Amount or other amount payable to such Holder in
respect of the CVRs.

 



 

(e) Any portion of any Milestone Payment Amount that remains undistributed to
the Holders twelve (12) months after the applicable Milestone Payment Date
(including by means of uncashed checks or invalid addresses on the CVR
Register) will be delivered by the Rights Agent to Parent or a person
nominated in writing by Parent (with written notice thereof from Parent to the
Rights Agent), and any Holder will thereafter look only to Parent for payment,
without interest, of such Milestone Payment Amount (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws).

 



      

 

 



 

(f) If any Milestone Payment Amount (or portion thereof) remains unclaimed by
a Holder two (2) years after the applicable Milestone Payment Date (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which such Milestone Payment Amount
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority), such Milestone Payment Amount (or portion thereof) will, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent and will be
transferred to Parent or a person nominated in writing by Parent (with written
notice thereof from Parent to the Rights Agent), free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto, and no consideration or
compensation shall be payable therefor. Neither Parent nor the Rights Agent
will be liable to any Person in respect of any Milestone Payment Amount
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar legal requirement under applicable Law.

 



 

Section 2.5 _No Voting, Dividends or Interest; No Equity or Ownership
Interest._

 



 

(a) CVRs will not have any voting or dividend rights, and interest will not
accrue on any amounts payable in respect of CVRs.

 



 

(b) CVRs will not represent any equity or ownership interest in Parent, any
constituent company to the Merger, or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation). The sole right of each Holder to
receive property hereunder is the right to receive the Milestone Payment
Amount, if any, in accordance with the terms hereof. It is hereby acknowledged
and agreed that a CVR shall not constitute a security of Parent, any
constituent company to the Merger, or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation).

 



 

Section 2.6 _Ability to Abandon CVR._

 



 

A Holder may at any time, at such Holders option, abandon all of such
Holders remaining rights represented by CVRs by transferring such CVR to
Parent or a person nominated in writing by Parent (with written notice thereof
from Parent to the Rights Agent) without consideration in compensation
therefor, and such rights will be cancelled, with the Rights Agent being
promptly notified in writing by Parent of such Transfer and cancellation.
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to prohibit Parent or any of its
Affiliates from offering to acquire or acquiring CVRs, in private transactions
or otherwise, for consideration in its sole discretion. Any CVRs acquired by
Parent or any of its Affiliates shall be automatically deemed extinguished and
no longer outstanding for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 3 
THE RIGHTS AGENT**

 



 

Section 3.1 _Certain Duties and Responsibilities._

 



 

(a) The Rights Agent will not have any liability for any actions taken or not
taken in connection with this Agreement, except to the extent such liability
arises as a result of the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of
the Rights Agent (in each case as determined by a final non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction).

 



     

 

 



 

(b) The Rights Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility in the case of

responsibility to initiate or attempt to initiate any proceedings at law or
otherwise or to make any demand upon Parent. All rights of action under this
Agreement may be enforced by the Rights Agent, any claim, action, suit, audit,
investigation or proceeding instituted by the Rights Agent will be brought in
its name as the Rights Agent and any recovery in connection therewith will be
for the proportionate benefit of all the Holders, as their respective rights
or interests may appear on the CVR Register.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Certain Rights of Rights Agent._

 



 

(a) The Rights Agent undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as
are specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no implied covenants or
obligations will be read into this Agreement against the Rights Agent.

 



 

(b) The Rights Agent may rely and will be protected by Parent in acting or
refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order or
other paper or document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and to have
been signed or presented by or on behalf of Parent.

 



 

(c) Whenever the Rights Agent deems it desirable that a matter be proved or
established prior to taking or omitting any action hereunder, the Rights Agent
may (i) rely upon an Officers Certificate and (ii) incur no liability and be
held harmless by Parent for or in respect of any action taken or omitted to be
taken by it under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such
Officers Certificate.

 



 

(d) The Rights Agent may engage and consult with counsel of its selection, and
the advice or opinion of such counsel will, in the absence of bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Rights Agent, be full and
complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or not
taken by the Rights Agent in reliance thereon.

 



 

(e) Any permissive rights of the Rights Agent hereunder will not be construed
as a duty.

 



 

(f) The Rights Agent will not be required to give any note or surety in
respect of the execution of its powers or otherwise under this Agreement.

penalty, cost or expense (each, a " _Loss_ ") suffered or incurred by the
Rights Agent and arising out of or in connection with the Rights Agents
performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including the reasonable
and documented costs and expenses of defending the Rights Agent against any
claims, charges, demands, actions or suits arising out of or in connection
with the execution, acceptance, administration, exercise and performance of
its duties under this Agreement, including the costs and expenses of defending
against any claim of liability arising therefrom, directly or indirectly, or
enforcing its rights hereunder, except to the extent such Loss has been
determined by a final non-appealable decision of a court of competent
jurisdiction to

 



     

 

 



 

have resulted from the Rights Agents gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct or breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(h) In addition to the indemnification provided under _Section 3.2(g)_,
Parent agrees (i) to pay the fees of the Rights Agent in connection with the
Rights Agents performance of its obligations hereunder, as agreed upon in
writing by the Rights Agent and Parent on or prior to the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) to reimburse the Rights Agent for all reasonable and
properly documented out-of-pocket expenses, including all Taxes imposed on the
Rights Agent (other than income, receipt, franchise or similar Taxes) and
governmental charges, incurred by the Rights Agent in the performance of its
obligations under this Agreement, except that Parent will have no obligation
to pay the fees of the Rights Agent or reimburse the Rights Agent in
connection with any lawsuit initiated by the Rights Agent on behalf of itself
or the Holders, except in the case of any suit enforcing the provisions of
_Section 2.4(a)_, _Section 2.4(b)_ or _Section 3.2(g),_ if Parent is found
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be liable to the Rights Agent or the
Holders, as applicable in such suit.

 



 

(i) No provision of this Agreement shall require the Rights Agent to expend or
risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its
rights or powers if it believes that repayment of such funds or adequate
indemnification against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to
it.

 



 

(j) Subject to applicable Law, (i) the Rights Agent and any shareholder,
Affiliate, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or
deal in any securities of Parent or become peculiarly interested in any
transaction in which Parent may be interested, or contract with or lend money
to Parent or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not the
Rights Agent under this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein will preclude the
Rights Agent from acting in any other capacity for Parent or for any other
Person.

 



 

(k) Parent shall perform, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed,
acknowledged and delivered all such further and other acts, documents,

for the carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of
this Agreement.

 



 

(l) The Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the
statements of fact or recitals contained in this Agreement (except its

statements and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made by Parent
only.

 



 

(m) The obligations of Parent under this _Section 3.2_ shall survive the
expiration of the CVRs and the termination of this Agreement and the
resignation, replacement or removal of the Rights Agent.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor._

 



 

(a) The Rights Agent may resign at any time by written notice to Parent and
the Holders Representative. Any such resignation notice shall specify the
date on which such resignation will take effect (which shall be at least
forty-five (45) days following the date that

 



     

 

 



 

such resignation notice is delivered), and such resignation will be effective
on the earlier of (x) the date so specified and (y) the appointment of a
successor Rights Agent.

 



 

(b) Parent with the written consent of the Holders Representative (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), will have
the right to remove the Rights Agent at any time by written notice to the
Rights Agent, specifying the date on which such removal will take effect. Such
notice will be given at least forty-five (45) days prior to the date so
specified (or, if earlier, the appointment of the successor Rights Agent).

 



 

(c) If the Rights Agent resigns, is removed or becomes incapable of acting,
Parent will promptly appoint, with the written consent of the Holders
Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), a qualified successor Rights Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if Parent fails to make such appointment within a period of forty-five (45)
days after giving notice of such removal or after it has been notified in
writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated
Rights Agent, then the incumbent Rights Agent or the Holders Representative
may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new
Rights Agent. The successor Rights Agent so appointed will, upon its
acceptance of such appointment in accordance with this _Section 3.3(c)_ and
_Section 3.4_, become the Rights Agent for all purposes hereunder.

 



 

(d) Parent will give notice to the Holders and the Holders Representative of
each resignation or removal of the Rights Agent and each appointment of a
successor Rights Agent in accordance with _Section 8.2_. Each notice will
include the name and address of the successor Rights Agent. If Parent fails to
send such notice within ten (10) Business Days after acceptance of appointment
by a successor Rights Agent, the successor Rights Agent will cause the notice
to be mailed at the expense of Parent.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 3.3_, unless
consented to in writing by the Holders Representative, Parent will not
appoint as a successor Rights Agent any Person that is not a stock transfer
agent of national reputation or the corporate trust department of a commercial
bank.

 



 

(f) The Rights Agent will reasonably cooperate with Parent and any successor
Rights Agent in connection with the transition of the duties and
responsibilities of the Rights Agent to the successor Rights Agent, including
the transfer of all relevant data, including the CVR Register, to the

Section 3.4 _Acceptance of Appointment by Successor._

 



 

Every successor Rights Agent appointed hereunder will, at or prior to such
appointment, execute, acknowledge and deliver to Parent and to the resigning
or removed Rights Agent an instrument accepting such appointment and a
counterpart of this Agreement, and such successor Rights Agent, without any
further act, deed or conveyance, will become vested with all the rights,
powers, trusts and duties of the Rights Agent; _provided_ , _however_ , that
upon the request of Parent or the successor Rights Agent, such resigning or
removed Rights Agent will execute and deliver an instrument transferring to
such successor Rights Agent all the rights, powers and trusts of such
resigning or removed Rights Agent.

are delivered a Milestone Non-Achievement Certificate for a Sales Measurement
Period and the Net Sales Statement for such Sales Measurement Period pursuant
to _Section 2.4(b)_ of this Agreement (the " _Review Request Period_ "),
Parent shall provide, and shall cause its Affiliates to provide, the
Independent Accountant with access upon reasonable notice and during normal
business hours to such records of Parent or its Affiliates the Independent
Accountant may reasonably require to verify the accuracy of the statements set
forth in the Net Sales Statement accompanying such Milestone Non-Achievement
Certificate and the figures underlying the calculations set forth therein,
including any work papers and other documents and information related to such
Net Sales Statement as the Independent Accountant may request and as are
available to Parent or its Affiliates. The fees charged by the Independent
Accountant shall be paid by Parent. The Independent Accountant shall disclose
to the Holders Representative any matters directly related to their findings
and shall disclose whether it has determined that any statements set forth in
such Net Sales Statements are incorrect. The Independent Accountant shall
provide Parent with a copy of all disclosures made to the Holders
Representative.

 



 

(b) No later than thirty (30) days following initial access to such records of
Parent as described in _Section 4.3(a)_, the Independent Accountant shall

the Independent Accountant shall deliver a final written report to Parent and
the Holders Representative (the " _Final Shortfall Report_ "). If the
Independent Accountant in the Final Shortfall Report concludes that the
Milestone Payment should have been paid but was not paid when due, then no
later than sixty (60) days following its receipt of the Final Shortfall
Report, (i) Parent shall deliver to the Rights Agent the aggregate amount of
the Milestone Payment Amount payable to each Holder, _plus_ interest on such

ten (10) Business Days after the date on which the aggregate CVR Shortfall
Amount is delivered to the Rights Agent) (A) mail each Holder, by first-class
postage prepaid mail, a notification setting forth the Independent
Accountants determination, and (B) pay or cause to be paid to each Holder, by

which such notification is delivered to the Rights Agent), mail each Holder,
by first-class postage prepaid mail, a notification setting forth the
Independent Accountants determination. The Final Shortfall Report shall be
final, conclusive and binding on Parent and the Holders, shall be non-
appealable and shall not be subject to further review, absent manifest error.

 



 

(c) Each Person seeking to receive information from Parent in connection with
a review or audit pursuant to this _Section 4.3_ shall enter into, and shall
cause its accounting firm to enter into, a reasonable and mutually
satisfactory confidentiality agreement with Parent obligating such party to
retain all such financial information disclosed to such party in confidence
pursuant to such confidentiality agreement and not use such information for
any purpose other than the completion of such review or audit.

 



 

(d) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, enter into any
license or distribution agreement with any third party (other than Parent or
its Affiliates) with respect to a Product unless such agreement contains
provisions that would allow any Independent Accountant appointed pursuant to
this _Section 4.3_ such access to the records of the other party to such
license or distribution agreement as may be reasonably necessary to perform
its duties pursuant to this _Section 4.3_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and its Affiliates shall not be required to amend any of its existing
licenses or distribution agreements.

 



 

(e) If, upon the expiration of the applicable Review Request Period, the
Acting Holders have not requested a review of the applicable Net Sales
Statement in accordance with this _Section 4.3_, the calculations set forth
in such Net Sales Statement shall be binding and conclusive upon the Holders.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 4.4 _Diligent Efforts._

purpose of avoiding the occurrence of the Milestone during any Sale
Measurement Period.

 



 

Section 4.5 _Non-Use of Name._

 



 

Neither the Rights Agent nor the Holders shall use the name, trademark, trade
name or logo of Parent, its Affiliates, or their respective employees in any
publicity or news release relating to this Agreement or its subject matter,

any Person (each, a " _Parent Sale Transaction_ "):

 



 

(a) the Person formed by such consolidation or into which Parent is merged or
the Person that acquires by conveyance or transfer, or that leases, the

Person_ ") shall expressly assume, in writing, payment of amounts on all CVRs
and the performance of every duty and covenant of this Agreement on the part
of Parent to be performed or observed (each an " _Assignee_ "); and

 



 

(b) Parent shall deliver to the Rights Agent an Officers Certificate, stating
that such Parent Sale Transaction complies with this _Section 6.1_ and
_Section 6.2_ and that all conditions precedent herein provided for relating
to such transaction have been complied with.

joint venture, lease, license or any other transaction or arrangement, sells,
transfers, conveys or otherwise disposes of their respective rights in and to
any Product to a third party (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries),
then the Milestone shall be deemed to have occurred for all purposes under
this Agreement as of the consummation of the transaction or arrangement
involving such sale, transfer, conveyance or other disposition; _provided_ ,
that this _Section 6.3_ shall not be applicable to a Parent Sale Transaction.

postage prepaid, to each Holder at such Holders address as set forth in the

Any such notice to the Holders will be deemed given on the date of mailing. In
any case where notice to the Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to
mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular
Holder will affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other
Holders. Where this Agreement provides for notice in any manner, such notice
may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either
before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such
notice. Where this Agreement provides for notice to the Holders

Holders Representative after the date of this Agreement, not later than the
latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving

any action taken in reliance upon such waiver. In case by reason of the
suspension of regular mail service or by reason of any other cause, it shall
be impracticable to mail notice of any event as required by any provision of
this Agreement, then any method of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory
to the Rights Agent and the Holders Representative shall be deemed to be a
sufficient giving of such notice.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Entire Agreement._

 



 

As between Parent and the Rights Agent, this Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement, notwithstanding the reference to any other agreement herein, and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among or between any of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement.

successor Rights Agent shall be a party, or any corporation or limited
liability company succeeding to the stock transfer or other shareholder
services business of the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent, shall be
the successor to the Rights Agent under this Agreement without the execution
or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties
hereto, provided that such corporation or limited liability company or other
entity would be eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent under the
provisions of _Section 3.3_. The purchase of all or substantially all of the
Rights Agents

this Agreement in violation of this _Section 8.5_ will be void _ab initio_
and of no effect.

any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement or under
any covenant or provision herein contained, all such covenants and provisions

Section 8.11 _Counterparts; Effectiveness._

 



 

This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which will
be deemed an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and

deemed an original. This Agreement will become effective when each party
hereto will have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed

will have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any oral or
written agreement or any other communication).
