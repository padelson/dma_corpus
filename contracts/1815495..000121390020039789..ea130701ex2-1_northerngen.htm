Article III 
  
  _Effects of the Merger_

  



  

3.01 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of NGA, the Company, Merger Sub, or
any holder of any securities of NGA, the Company or Merger Sub, the following
transactions shall occur:

  



  

   

17

 



    



  

(a)   _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. The Merger Sub Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b)   _Capital Stock and Warrants of NGA_.

  



  

(i)  As used in this Agreement, " _Exchange Ratio_ " means one (1);
provided, however, that (A) the Company Split Adjustment shall be adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change, in each case with
respect to NGA Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior
to the Company Split Adjustment; (B) the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to
reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change, in each case with
respect to NGA Common Stock occurring on or after the Company Split
Adjustment and prior to the Effective Time; (C) the Company Split Adjustment
shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change, in
each case with respect to Company Common Shares occurring on or after the
date hereof and prior to the Company Split Adjustment; and (D) the Exchange
Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change, in
each case with respect to Company Common Shares following the Company Split
Adjustment and prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this _Section 3.01(b)(i)_ shall not be construed to permit the Company or NGA
to take any actions with respect to its securities that is prohibited by this
Agreement.

  



  

(ii)  Subject to the other provisions of this _Article III_ , each share
of NGA Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than any Excluded Shares and Redemption Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive from the Company the number of fully-paid and
nonassessable Company Common Shares (after giving effect to the Company Split
Adjustment) equal to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Per Share Merger
Consideration_ ").

  



  

(iii)  All such shares of NGA Common Stock, when so converted, shall cease
to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease to exist.
Each holder of a share of NGA Common Stock that was outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Redemption
Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.

  



  

(iv)  In consideration for, and in order to cause and compensate the
Company for, the issuance and delivery by the Company of the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration, the Surviving Corporation shall issue to the
Company one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation for each share of NGA Common Stock converted under
Section 3.01(b)(iii).

  



  

   

18

 



    



     

(v)   All shares of NGA Common Stock held by NGA as treasury shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time and not held on behalf of third
parties (collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall automatically be canceled
and cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(vi)  Each share of NGA Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time with respect to which a NGA stockholder has
validly exercised its Redemption Rights, and that shall be redeemed at the
Effective Time (the " _Redemption Shares_ "), shall not be entitled to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration and shall be converted into the
right to receive from NGA, in cash, an amount per share calculated in
accordance with such stockholder's Redemption Rights (such amount, the "
_Redemption Payment_ "). At or as promptly as practical after the Effective
Time, NGA shall make such cash payments in respect of each such Redemption
Share. As of the Effective Time, all such Redemption Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a Redemption Share (or related certificate
or book-entry share) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the cash payments from NGA referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence.

  



  

(vii) At the Effective Time and in accordance with Section 4.5 of the NGA
Warrant Agreement, the Company shall assume the NGA Warrant Agreement and
enter into such amendments thereto as are necessary to give effect to the
provisions of this _Section 3.01(b)(vii)_ , and each NGA Warrant then
outstanding and unexercised (including any NGA Working Capital Warrant issued
pursuant to the NGA Working Capital Warrant Purchase Agreement) shall
automatically without any action on the part of its holder, be converted into
a warrant to acquire a number of Company Common Shares at an adjusted
exercise price per share, in each case, as determined under this
_Section 3.01(b)(vii)_ (each resulting warrant, an " _Assumed Warrant_ ").
Each Assumed Warrant shall be subject to the same terms and conditions
(including exercisability terms) as were applicable to the corresponding NGA
Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent such
terms or conditions are rendered inoperative by the Transactions.
Accordingly, effective as of the Effective Time: (A) each Assumed Warrant
shall be exercisable solely for Company Common Shares; (B) the number of
Company Common Shares subject to each Assumed Warrant shall be equal to (x)
the number of shares of NGA Common Stock subject to the applicable NGA
Warrant _multiplied_ by (y) the Exchange Ratio; and (C) the per share exercise
price for the Company Common Shares issuable upon exercise of such Assumed
Warrant shall be equal to (x) the per share exercise price for the shares of
NGA Common Stock subject to the applicable NGA Warrant, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, _divided_  by (y) the Exchange
Ratio, rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent; and
(D) no fraction of a Company Common Share will be issued upon any exercise of
any Assumed Warrants and, if the aggregate number of Company Common Shares
that a holder of any Assumed Warrants would be entitled to receive upon any
exercise of any Assumed Warrants would otherwise include a fraction of a
Company Common Share, the Company shall, upon such exercise, round up to the
nearest whole number the aggregate number of Company Common Shares to be
issued to such holder as a result of the exercise of all such Assumed Warrants
so exercised. The Company shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for future issuance, and shall maintain such reservation for so long
as any of the Assumed Warrants remain outstanding, a sufficient number of
shares of Company Common Shares for delivery upon the exercise of such
Assumed Warrants.

  



  

   

19

 



    



  

(viii)   In the event that the NGA Common Stock and NGA Warrants comprising a
single NGA Unit have not been detached so as to permit separate
transferability or trading thereof prior to the Effective Time, then effective
immediately prior to the conversions contemplated by this _Section 3.01(b)_ ,
any and all NGA Units shall be automatically detached and broken out into
their constituent parts, such that a holder of one NGA Unit shall thereupon
hold one share of NGA Common Stock and one-half of one NGA Warrant, and
such underlying constituent securities shall be converted in accordance with
_Sections 3.01(b)(i)_ and _(vii)_ , respectively; provided, however, that if
upon such detachment, a holder of NGA Warrants would be deemed to hold a
fractional NGA Warrant, then prior to such conversion the number of NGA
Warrants deemed to be held by such holder shall be rounded down to the
nearest whole number.

  



  

3.02 _Exchange_.

  



  

(a)   _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by
the Company and reasonably satisfactory to NGA (the " _Exchange Agent_
"), for the benefit of the holders of NGA Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article III_ , the number of Company Common Shares
sufficient to deliver the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to this Agreement (such Company Common Shares being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Company shall cause the
Exchange Agent, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, to pay the Per Share
Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

  



  

(b)   _No Further Rights in NGA Common Stock_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration payable upon conversion of NGA Common Stock shall be deemed to
have been paid and issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such NGA Common Stock.

  



  

(c)   _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of NGA Common Stock for one year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Company, upon demand, and any
holders of NGA Common Stock who have not complied with this _Section 3.02_
shall thereafter look only to the Company for the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders
of NGA Common Stock as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any government
entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Company free and clear of any claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(d)   _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of NGA Stock for any
Company Common Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law in accordance with this _Section 3.02_.

  



  

(e)   _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub, NGA and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts
(including shares, warrants, options or other property) otherwise payable,
issuable or transferable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of NGA
Common Stock or NGA Warrants, such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to such payment, issuance or transfer under the Code or
any provision of state, provincial, local or non-U.S. Tax Law; _provided,
however_ , that prior to such deduction or withholding, it shall use
reasonable best efforts to give the applicable holder written notice to
permit such holder to determine and demonstrate that such deduction or
withholding is not required. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld and timely paid to the applicable Governmental Authority, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid, issued or transferred to the holder of the NGA
Common Stock or NGA Warrants in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

  



  

   

20

 



    



  

(f)   _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or shares representing
fractional Company Common Shares shall be issued upon the exchange of NGA
Common Stock and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to have any rights of a shareholder of the Company or a
holder of Company Common Shares. In lieu of any fractional Company
Common Share to which any holder of NGA Common Stock would otherwise be
entitled, the Exchange Agent shall round up or down to the nearest whole
Company Common Share, with a fraction of 0.5 rounded up. No cash settlements
shall be made with respect to fractional shares eliminated by rounding.

  



  

3.03 _Closing Statement; Payment of NGA Costs_.

  



  

(a)  No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing and in any
event not earlier than the time that holders of NGA Common Stock may no
longer elect redemption in accordance with the Redemption Rights, NGA shall
prepare and deliver to the Company a statement (the " _NGA Closing Statement_
") setting forth NGA's good faith estimate of: (i) the amount of NGA Cash;
(ii) the aggregate amount of cash proceeds that will be required to satisfy
any owed Redemption Payments; (iii) the amount of estimated NGA Costs
remaining unpaid as of the Closing and all relevant supporting documentation
used by NGA in calculating such amounts reasonably requested by the Company;
and (iv) the number of shares of NGA Common Stock to be outstanding as of
the Closing _less_ any Redemption Shares. The NGA Closing Statement and each
component thereof shall be prepared and calculated in accordance with the
definitions contained in this Agreement. From and after delivery of the NGA
Closing Statement until the Closing, NGA shall (x) use reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with and provide the Company and its Representatives all
information reasonably requested by the Company or any of its Representatives
and within NGA's or its Representatives' possession or control in connection
with the Company's review of the NGA Closing Statement and (y) consider in
good faith any comments to the NGA Closing Statement provided by the Company,
which comments the Company shall deliver to NGA no later than one (1)
Business Day prior to the Closing Date, and NGA shall revise such NGA Closing
Statement to incorporate any changes NGA determines are reasonably necessary
or appropriate given such comments.

  



  

(b)  Conditional upon the Closing, and to the extent so provided in the NGA
Closing Statement (as such NGA Closing Statement may be revised in accordance
with Section 3.03(a)), the Company shall pay or cause to be paid all
outstanding NGA Costs, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts specified therefor by the applicable third parties to which such NGA
Costs are owing.

  



  

   

21

 



    



  

(c)   For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement, following the Closing, the Surviving
Corporation shall be responsible for any and all obligations and liabilities
of NGA, including NGA Costs, remaining unpaid or unsatisfied upon and
following the Closing.

  



  

3.04 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of NGA shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of NGA Stock thereafter on the records of NGA.

  



  

3.05 _No Appraisal and Dissenters ' Rights_. No dissenters' or appraisal
rights shall be available with respect to the Transactions.

a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a
Lien on any property or asset of NGA pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation to which NGA is a party or by which NGA or any of
its properties or assets are bound or affected, except, with respect to
_clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults or other occurrences which, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a NGA Material Adverse
Effect.

  



  

(b)  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of NGA do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by each of NGA will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, or expiration or termination of any waiting period by, any Governmental
Authority, except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange
Act, the Securities Act, Blue Sky Laws and state takeover laws, and
applicable Canadian Securities Laws, as applicable, the pre-
merger notification requirements of the HSR Act, and filing and recordation
of appropriate documents as required by the DGCL and the QBCA and (ii) where
the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or
to make such filings or notifications, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, prevent or materially delay consummation of any of the Transactions
or otherwise prevent NGA from performing its material obligations under this
Agreement.

  



  

5.06 _Compliance_. NGA is not and has not been in conflict with, or in
default, breach or violation of, (a) any Law applicable to NGA or by which
any property or asset of NGA is bound or affected, or (b) any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise
or other instrument or obligation to which NGA is a party or by which NGA or
any property or asset of NGA is bound, except, in each case, for any such
conflicts, defaults, breaches or violations that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a NGA
Material Adverse Effect. NGA is in possession of all material franchises,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,
exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental
Authority necessary for NGA to own, lease and operate its properties or to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted.

  



  

   

44

 



    



  

5.07 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Sarbanes-Oxley_.

  



  

(a)  NGA has filed all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents, including any exhibits thereto, required to be filed by it with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since its
incorporation, together with any amendments, restatements or supplements
thereto (collectively, the " _NGA SEC Reports_ "). As of their respective
dates, the NGA SEC Reports (i) complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and
(ii) did not, at the time they were filed, or, if amended, as of the date of
such amendment, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein not misleading, in the case of any NGA SEC Report
that is a registration statement, or include any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, in the case of any other NGA SEC Report.

  



  

(b)  Each of the financial statements (including, in each case, any notes
thereto) contained in the NGA SEC Reports was prepared in accordance with
GAAP (applied on a consistent basis) and Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, as
applicable, throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited financial statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly presents, in all material
respects, the financial position, results of operations, changes
in stockholders equity and cash flows of NGA as at the respective dates
thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein, (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments
which, individually or in the aggregate, have not been, and would not
reasonably be expected to be, material). NGA has no off-balance sheet
arrangements that are not disclosed in the NGA SEC Reports.

  



  

(c)  Except as and to the extent set forth in the NGA SEC Reports (including
NGA's consolidated balance sheet for the quarterly period ended September 30,
2020 and the notes thereto), NGA or its Subsidiaries do not have any liability
or obligation of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) required to be reflected on a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with GAAP, except for (i) liabilities and obligations incurred in
the ordinary course of NGA's business since September 30, 2020, (ii)
obligations for future performance under any contracts to which NGA is a
party, and (iii) liabilities for transaction expenses in connection with this
Agreement, the Transactions, the Subscription Agreements and the Private
Placements.

  



  

(d)  NGA is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange.

  



  

   

45

 



    



  

(e)  NGA has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to NGA
and other material information required to be disclosed by NGA in the reports
and other documents that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to NGA's principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting NGA's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer to material
information required to be included in NGA's periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act.

  



  

(f) NGA maintains systems of internal control over financial reporting that
are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies and procedures
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance: (i) that NGA maintains records
that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect, in all material
respects, its transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP; (iii) that receipts and expenditures are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and its board
of directors; and (iv) regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of its assets that could have a
material effect on its financial statements.

  



  

(g)  There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by NGA
to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or
director of NGA, and NGA has not taken any action prohibited by Section 402 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

(h)  Neither NGA (including, to the knowledge of NGA, any employee thereof)
nor NGA's independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (i) any
material weakness or significant deficiency in the system of internal
accounting controls utilized by NGA, (ii) any fraud that involves NGA's
management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of
financial statements or the internal accounting controls utilized by NGA or
(iii) as of the date hereof, any claim or allegation regarding any of the
foregoing.

  



  

(i) As of the date hereof, there are no outstanding comments from the SEC
with respect to the NGA SEC Reports. To the knowledge of NGA, none of the NGA
SEC Reports filed on or prior to the date hereof is subject to ongoing SEC
review or investigation as of the date hereof.

  



  

5.08 _Business Activities; Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

  



  

(a)  Since its incorporation, NGA has not conducted any business activities
other than activities directed toward the accomplishment of a Business
Combination. Except as set forth in the NGA Organizational Documents, there is
no agreement, commitment or Governmental Order binding upon NGA or to which
NGA is a party which has had or would reasonably be expected to have the
effect of prohibiting or impairing any business practice of NGA or any
acquisition of property by NGA or the conduct of business by NGA as
currently conducted or as contemplated to be conducted as of the Closing.

  



  

   

46

 



    



  

(b)   NGA does not own or have a right to acquire, directly or indirectly,
any interest or investment (whether equity or debt) in any corporation,
partnership, joint venture, business, trust or other entity. Except for this
Agreement and the Transactions, NGA has no interests, rights, obligations or
liabilities with respect to, and is not party to, bound by or has its assets
or property subject to, in each case whether directly or indirectly, any
Contract or transaction which is, or could reasonably be interpreted as
constituting, a Business Combination.

  



  

(c)  NGA is not a party to any contract with any other person other than (i)
this Agreement and the agreements expressly contemplated hereby, (ii)
engagement and indemnification agreements with legal, financial and other
advisors listed in Section 5.08(c) of the NGA Disclosure Schedule, (iii)
contracts filed prior to the date hereof as exhibits to the NGA SEC Reports,
(iv) the NGA Working Capital Warrant Purchase Agreement, (v) DandO Insurance
contracts, (vi) the contracts listed in Section 5.08(c) of the NGA Disclosure
Schedule, and (vii) any other contracts that, in the aggregate, require
payment following the date hereof by NGA of less than $250,000 in the
aggregate.

  



  

(d)  Since its initial public offering and prior to the date of this
Agreement, except as otherwise reflected in the NGA SEC Reports, or as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (i) NGA has conducted its business
in all material respects in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent
with past practice, other than due to any actions taken due to any COVID-19
Measures, (ii) NGA has not sold, assigned, transferred, permitted to lapse,
abandoned, or otherwise disposed of any right, title, or interest in or to
any of its material assets, and (iii) there has not been a NGA Material
Adverse Effect.

  



  

5.09 _Absence of Litigation_. There is no material Action pending or, to the
knowledge of NGA, threatened against NGA, or any property or asset of NGA,
before any Governmental Authority. Neither NGA nor any material property or
asset of NGA is subject to any continuing order of, consent decree,
settlement agreement or other similar written agreement with, or, to the
knowledge of NGA, continuing investigation by, any Governmental Authority.

  



  

5.10 _Board Approval; Vote Required_.

  



  

(a)  The NGA Board, by resolutions duly adopted by majority vote of those
voting at a meeting duly called and held and not subsequently rescinded or
modified in any way, has duly (i) determined that this Agreement and the
Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of NGA and its
stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the Transactions and declared
their advisability, (iii) recommended that the stockholders of NGA approve
and adopt this Agreement and the Merger, and directed that this Agreement and
the Transactions, be submitted for consideration by the stockholders of NGA at
the NGA Stockholders' Meeting.

  



  

(b)  The only vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of
NGA necessary to approve the Transactions is the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of NGA Common Stock.

  



  

5.11 _Brokers_. Except for Barclays Capital Inc., no broker, finder or
investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or
commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of NGA. NGA has provided the Company with a true and complete
copy of all contracts, agreements and arrangements, including its engagement
letters, with Barclays Capital Inc., other than those that have expired or
terminated and as to which no further services are contemplated thereunder to
be provided in the future.

  



  

   

47

 



    



  

5.12 _NGA Trust Fund_. As of the date of this Agreement, NGA has no less than
$319,000,000 in the trust fund established by NGA for the benefit of its
public stockholders (the " _Trust Fund_ ") maintained in a trust account
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the " _Trust Account_ "), from which amount
an aggregate of approximately $11,200,000 of deferred underwriting discounts
and commissions will be payable upon the Closing of the Merger. The monies of
such Trust Account are invested in United States Government securities or
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and held in trust by
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the " _Trustee_ ") pursuant to
the Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of August 17, 2020,
between NGA and the Trustee (the " _Trust Agreement_ "). The Trust Agreement
has not been amended or modified and is valid and in full force and effect and
is enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the Remedies
Exceptions. NGA has complied in all material respects with the terms of the
Trust Agreement and is not in breach thereof or default thereunder and there
does not exist any event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of
time, would constitute such a breach or default by NGA or the Trustee. There
are no separate contracts, agreements, side letters or other agreements or
understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or implied): (i)
between NGA and the Trustee that would cause the description of the Trust
Agreement in the NGA SEC Reports to be inaccurate in any material respect; or
(ii) to which NGA is a party that would entitle any person (other than holders
of Redemption Shares) to any portion of the proceeds in the Trust Account
(other than following release thereof to NGA, as assets of NGA available to
satisfy its liabilities generally). Prior to the Closing, none of the funds
held in the Trust Account may be released except to pay: (1) franchise Taxes
and income Taxes from any interest income earned in the Trust Account; and (2)
any owed Redemption Payments. To NGA's knowledge, as of the date of this
Agreement, following the Effective Time, no stockholder of NGA shall be
entitled to receive any amount from the Trust Account except to the extent
such stockholder is owed a Redemption Payment. There are no Actions
pending or, to the knowledge of NGA, threatened in writing with respect to
the Trust Account. As of the date hereof, and assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company contained herein and the
compliance by the Company and Merger Sub of their respective obligations
hereunder, NGA has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the use
of funds in the Trust Account will not be satisfied or that funds available
in the Trust Account (other than such funds released in accordance with the
terms of the Trust Agreement) will not be available to NGA at the Effective
Time.

  



  

5.13 _Employees_. Other than any officers as described in the NGA SEC Reports,
NGA has no employees on its payroll, and has not retained any contractors,
other than consultants and advisors in the ordinary course of business. Other
than reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by NGA's officers
and directors in connection with activities on NGA's behalf in an aggregate
amount not in excess of the amount of cash held by NGA outside of the Trust
Account, NGA has no unsatisfied material liability with respect to any
officer or director. NGA has never and does not currently maintain, sponsor,
or contribute to any Employee Benefit Plan.

  



    

48

respects; (ii) has timely paid all material Taxes that are shown as due on
such filed Tax Returns and any other material Taxes that it is
otherwise obligated to pay, except with respect to current Taxes that are not
yet due and delinquent or that are otherwise being contested in good faith;
(iii) with respect to all material Tax Returns filed by or with respect to it,
has not waived any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to
any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency which
such waiver or extension remains in effect; and (iv) does not have any
deficiency, assessment, claim, audit, examination, investigation, litigation
or other proceeding in respect of a material amount of Taxes or material Tax
matters pending, asserted or proposed or threatened in writing, for a Tax
period which the statute of limitations for assessments remains open.

  



  

(b)  NGA does not have any outstanding liability for the payment of any
material Taxes, except as set forth on the financial statements for the
quarterly period ended September 30, 2020, contained in the NGA SEC Reports or
which relate to Taxes not yet due and payable or Tax Returns not yet required

primary purpose of which does not relate to Taxes.

  



  

(d)  NGA has withheld and paid to the appropriate Tax authority all material
Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid

(i) To the knowledge of NGA, NGA has not taken, has not agreed to take or has
no plan or intention to take any action that would reasonably be expected to
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code; provided, however, that NGA has independently
assessed, and no such representation or warranty is made as to, any actions
contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

  



  

(j)  NGA is not an investment company as defined in Sections
368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.

  



  

(k)  No recipient of, or current of former holder of, NGA Founders Stock, NGA
Common Stock or NGA Warrants is an employee or officer of NGA, or otherwise
bears a relationship to NGA, such that NGA would be required to pay or
otherwise be subject to liability for any payroll, employment, withholding,
severance or other similar Taxes in respect of such recipient or holder,
except for Taxes that have been paid as of the date hereof.

  



  

5.15 _Registration and Listing_. The issued and outstanding NGA Units are

any of its affiliates has taken any action in an attempt to terminate the
registration of the NGA Units, the shares of NGA Common Stock or the NGA
Warrants under the Exchange Act.

  



  

5.16 _Interested Party Transactions_. Except as described in the NGA SEC
Reports, there are no transactions, contracts, side letters, arrangements or
understandings between NGA, on the one hand, and any director, officer,
employee, stockholder, warrant holder or affiliate of NGA, on the other hand

expected to violate applicable Law, and nothing contained in this _Section

Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date.
Prior to the Closing Date, each of NGA and the Company shall exercise,

6.03 _Claims Against Trust Account_. The Company does not now have, and shall
not at any time prior to the Effective Time have, any claim to, or make any
claim against, the Trust Fund, regardless of whether such claim arises as a
result of, in connection with or relating in any way to, the business
relationship between the Company on the one hand, and NGA on the other hand,
this Agreement, or any other agreement or any other matter, and regardless of
whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory
of legal liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred to in
this _Section 6.03_ as the " _Claims_ "). The Company hereby irrevocably
waives any Claim it may have, now or in the future and shall not seek
recourse against the Trust Fund for any reason whatsoever in respect thereof;

prohibit the Company from pursuing a claim against NGA or any other person (a)
for legal relief against monies or other assets of NGA held outside of the
Trust Account or for specific performance or other equitable relief in
connection with the Transactions or (b) for damages for breach of this
Agreement against NGA (or any successor entity) in the event this Agreement

transaction with another party. In the event that the Company commences any
action or proceeding against or involving the Trust Fund in violation of the
foregoing, NGA shall be entitled to recover from the Company the associated
reasonable legal fees and costs in connection with any such action.

7.02 _Registration Statement; Proxy Statement_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms of this _Section 7.02_, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, NGA and the Company shall
(i) cooperate in preparing and shall cause to be filed with the SEC a
registration statement on Form F-4 (together with all amendments thereto, the
" _Registration Statement_ ") in connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of the Company Common Shares and Assumed Warrants (including
the Company Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the Assumed Warrants) to

Agreement, which shall include a proxy statement in preliminary form (the "
_Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the NGA Stockholders' Meeting and (ii)
cooperate in preparing and causing to be filed with the Autorite des marches
financiers (the " _AMF_ ") a preliminary non-offering prospectus in respect
of the Company (together with all amendments thereto, the " _Canadian
Prospectus_ "). Each of the Company and NGA shall furnish all information
concerning such party as the other party may reasonably request in connection
with such actions and the preparation of the Merger Materials (as defined
below) and the Canadian Prospectus. NGA and the Company each shall use their
reasonable best efforts to (w) cause the Registration Statement, when filed
with the SEC, and the Canadian Prospectus, when filed with the AMF, to comply
in all material respects with all legal requirements applicable thereto, (x)
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to and resolve all comments
received from the SEC concerning the Merger Materials and the AMF concerning
the Canadian Prospectus, (y) cause the Registration Statement to be declared
effective as promptly as practicable, and to cause the final Canadian
Prospectus to be filed and definitively receipted by the AMF as promptly as
practicable after the Closing Date and (z) keep the Registration Statement
effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Transactions. Prior to
the effective date of the Registration Statement, NGA shall take all actions
necessary to cause the Merger Materials to be mailed to its stockholders as of
the applicable record date as promptly as practicable (and in any event
within three (3) Business Days) following the date upon which the Company

the Company and NGA shall otherwise reasonably assist and cooperate with the
other party in the preparation of the Merger Materials and the Canadian
Prospectus and the resolution of any comments received from the SEC and the
AMF, as applicable. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Merger Materials_ " means the Registration Statement, including the
prospectus forming a part thereof, the Proxy Statement, and any amendments
thereto.

  



  

(b) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to the Merger Materials or the
Canadian Prospectus will be made by the Company or NGA without the prior
approval of the other party (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The Company will advise NGA, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement or
the Canadian Prospectus has become effective or receipted, as applicable, or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop
order, or of the suspension of the qualification of the Company Common Shares
to be issued or issuable to the stockholders of NGA in connection with this
Agreement for offering or sale in any jurisdiction. The parties will advise
each other, promptly after they receive notice thereof, of any request by the
SEC for amendment of the Merger Materials or by the AMF for amendment of the
Canadian Prospectus or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by
the SEC or the AMF for additional information and shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, supply the other party with copies of all
written correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or the AMF or the staff of the SEC or the AMF, on the other
hand, or, if not in writing, a description of such communication,
with respect to the Merger Materials, the Canadian Prospectus or the Merger.
No response to any comments from the SEC or the AMF or the staff of the SEC
or the AMF relating to the Merger Materials or the Canadian Prospectus will be
made by any party without the prior consent of the other party (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without
providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon unless pursuant to a telephone call initiated by the SEC or the AMF,
as applicable.

  



  

   

57

 



    



  

(c)  NGA represents that the information supplied by NGA for inclusion in the
Merger Materials shall not, at (i) the time the Registration Statement is
declared effective, (ii) the time the Merger Materials are mailed to NGA's
stockholders and (iii) the time of the NGA Stockholders' Meeting, include any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In addition, NGA
represents that the information supplied by NGA for inclusion in the Canadian
Prospectus shall not, at the date of the Canadian Prospectus, include any
"misrepresentation" (as defined in Canadian Securities Laws). If, at any
time, any event or circumstance relating to NGA or its officers or directors
should be discovered by NGA which should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Merger Materials or the Canadian Prospectus, NGA shall
promptly inform the Company.

  



  

(d)  The Company represents that the information supplied by the Company for
inclusion in the Merger Materials shall not, at (i) the time the Registration
Statement is declared effective, (ii) the time the Merger Materials are mailed
to NGA's stockholders and (iii) the time of the NGA Stockholders' Meeting,
include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In addition, the
Company represents that the information supplied by the Company for
inclusion in the Canadian Prospectus shall not, at the date of the Canadian
Prospectus, include any "misrepresentation" (as defined in Canadian
Securities Laws). If, at any time, any event or circumstance relating to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or its officers or directors should be
discovered by the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or a
supplement to the Merger Materials or the Canadian Prospectus, the Company
shall promptly inform NGA.

  



  

7.03 _Merger Sub Consent_. Promptly following the execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, approve and adopt
this Agreement and approve the Transactions.

  



  

7.04 _NGA Stockholders ' Meeting_.

  



  

(a) NGA shall call and hold a meeting of NGA's stockholders (including any
adjournment or postponement thereof, the " _NGA Stockholders ' Meeting_") as
promptly as practicable after the date on which the Registration Statement
becomes effective for the purpose of voting solely upon the (i) approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, (ii) the approval of such
amendments to NGA's Organizational Document as may be necessary to permit the
issuance of the NGA Working Capital Warrants immediately prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the terms of the NGA Working Capital Warrant
Purchase Agreement, and (iii) such other approvals as may be mutually agreed
by NGA and the Company as necessary or appropriate to authorize the
Transactions and otherwise give effect to the terms of this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed (clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), collectively, the " _NGA Proposals_ ").
NGA shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold the NGA Stockholders'
Meeting as soon as practicable after the date on which the Registration
Statement becomes effective; provided, that NGA may (or, upon the receipt of
a request to do so from the Company, shall) postpone or adjourn the NGA
Stockholders' Meeting on one or more occasions for up to thirty (30) days in
the aggregate to the extent that such postponement or adjournment is
reasonably necessary to solicit additional proxies to obtain approval of the
NGA Proposals. NGA shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
approval of the NGA Proposals at the NGA Stockholders' Meeting, including by
soliciting from its stockholders proxies as promptly as possible in favor of
the NGA Proposals, and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the required vote or consent of its stockholders. The NGA Board shall
recommend to its stockholders that they approve the NGA Proposals

  



  

   

58

 



    



  

(b)   (the " _NGA Recommendation_ ") and shall include the NGA Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement. Neither the NGA Board nor any committee thereof
shall: (i) withdraw, modify, amend or qualify (or propose to withdraw, modify,
amend or qualify publicly) the NGA Recommendation, or fail to include the NGA
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement; or (ii) approve, recommend or declare
advisable (or publicly propose to do so) any NGA Alternative Transaction (any
action described in clauses (i) through (ii) being referred to as a " _NGA
Change in Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
NGA Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, determines in
good faith that failure to effect a NGA Change in Recommendation would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of NGA under applicable Law, then the NGA Board may effect a NGA
Change in Recommendation so long as NGA (to the extent lawful and reasonably
practicable) first provides the Company with at least five (5) Business Days
advance written notice of such withdrawal or modification, and during such
five (5) Business Day period, and prior to effecting any NGA Change in
Recommendation, NGA and its Representatives must negotiate with the Company
and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that the Company desires
to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that the NGA Board (or a committee thereof) would no longer
determine that the failure to make a NGA Change in Recommendation would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of NGA under applicable Law.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding (i) any NGA Change in Recommendation, (ii) the making of
any inquiry or proposal with respect to a NGA Alternative Transaction or
(iii) anything to the contrary contained herein, unless this Agreement has
been earlier validly terminated in accordance with _Section 9.01_ , (A) in no
event shall NGA execute or enter into any agreement in principle, letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, term sheet, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other written arrangement relating to any NGA Alternative
Transaction or terminate this Agreement in connection therewith and (B) NGA
shall otherwise remain subject to the terms of this Agreement, including NGA's
obligation to use reasonable best efforts to obtain the approval of the NGA
Proposals at the NGA Stockholders' Meeting in accordance with _Section
7.04(a)_.

  



  

7.05 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company
and NGA shall (and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to): (i) provide
to the other party (and the other party's officers, directors, employees,
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other representatives,
collectively, " _Representatives_ ") reasonable access at reasonable times
upon prior notice to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and
other facilities of such party and its Subsidiaries and to the books and
records thereof; and (ii) furnish promptly to the other party such
information concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets,
liabilities, personnel and other aspects of such party and its Subsidiaries
as the other party or its Representatives may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor NGA shall be required
to provide access to or disclose information where the access or disclosure
would likely result in the breach of any contract, jeopardize the protection
of attorney-client privilege or contravene applicable Law (it being agreed
that the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not result in such jeopardy
or contravention).

  



  

   

59

 



    



  

(b)  All information obtained by the parties pursuant to this _Section 7.05_
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the confidentiality agreement,
dated August 19, 2020 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between NGA and
the Company.

  



  

(c)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each party
(and its respective Representatives) may consult any Tax advisor as is
reasonably necessary regarding the Tax treatment and Tax structure of the
Transactions and may disclose to such advisor as is reasonably necessary, the
intended Tax treatment and Tax structure of the Transactions and all materials
(including any Tax analysis) relating to such treatment or structure, in each
case in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

7.06 _Directors ' and Officers' Indemnification_.

  



  

(a)  The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
exculpation, advancement or expense reimbursement than are set forth in the
charter or bylaws of NGA, which provisions shall not thereafter be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would affect adversely
the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time,
were directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of NGA, unless
such modification shall be required by applicable Law. The Surviving
Corporation shall, and the Company shall cause the Surviving Company to,
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of
NGA against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent that NGA would have been permitted under applicable Law, the
NGA Certificate of Incorporation or the bylaws of NGA, or any indemnification
agreement in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify or
exculpate such person (including the advancing of expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law).

  



  

(b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Company shall
cause to be maintained in effect directors' and officers' liability insurance
(" _D andO Insurance_") covering those persons who, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, are covered by NGA's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof (true, correct and complete
copies of which have been heretofore made available to the Company or its
agents or Representatives) (the " _NGA D andO Insurance_") on terms not less
favorable than the terms of such NGA DandO Insurance coverage, and from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the current NGA
DandO Insurance carrier, except that in no event shall the Company be required
to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of 300% of the
aggregate annual premium payable by NGA for such insurance policy for the year
ended December 31, 2020 (the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ "). If the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, then
the Company shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the current NGA DandO Insurance carrier.

  



  

   

60

 



    



  

(c)  Prior to the Effective Time, NGA may purchase a prepaid "tail" policy
with respect to DandO Insurance from an insurance carrier with the same or
better credit rating as the current NGA DandO Insurance carrier so long as the
aggregate cost for such "tail" policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual
Premium. If NGA elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force
and effect for a period of no less than six (6) years after the Effective
Time and continue to honor its obligations thereunder but it shall not be
otherwise required under Section 7.06(b) to cause to be maintained in effect
the DandO Insurance.

  



  

(d)  With respect to any claims that may be made under the DandO Insurance or
any applicable "tail" policies, (i) prior to the Effective Time, NGA and the
Company shall cooperate with the other party as reasonably requested by such
other Party, and (ii) after the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate
with any person insured by such policies as reasonably requested by such
person.

  



  

(e)  On the Closing Date, the Company shall (i) enter into customary
indemnification agreements reasonably satisfactory to each of the Company and
NGA with the post-Closing directors and officers of the Company, and (ii)
shall assume all rights and obligations of NGA under all indemnification
agreements then in effect between NGA and any person who is or was a director
or officer of NGA prior to the Effective Time (the " _NGA Indemnification
Agreements_ "), which indemnification agreements shall continue to be
effective following the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the
indemnification agreements with the pre-Closing directors and officers of the
Company shall continue to be effective following the Closing, and the Company
shall continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

  



  

(f)  For the avoidance of doubt, the rights under this _Section 7.06_ of any
person who was a director or officer of NGA prior to the Effective Time shall
be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any additional rights that any such
person may have under applicable Law or otherwise, including (as applicable)
as an officer or director of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
the other Company Subsidiaries following the Effective Time.

_Article VIII_ to not be satisfied at Closing. An unintentional failure to
give notice under this _Section 7.08_ shall not be deemed to be a breach of

Authority, gives the other parties the opportunity to attend and participate
at such meeting or conference. Subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the parties will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in
exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other parties

Governmental Authority that is inconsistent with or intended to delay its
action on requests for a consent or the consummation of the Transactions.

any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, could give rise to any breach or default) by any party to any
Subscription Agreement known by the notifying party; and (B) of the receipt

consistent with public statements set forth in the initial press release or
previously consented to by the other party in accordance with this _Section
7.10_. Furthermore, nothing contained in this _Section 7.10_ shall prevent
NGA or the Company and/or their respective affiliates from furnishing

required to be provided pursuant to this _Section 7.12(b)_ may be restricted
to outside counsel and may be redacted to remove references concerning the

that the condition set forth in _Sections 8.03(a)_ or _8.03(b)_ would not be
satisfied; _provided_ , _further_ , that, if such Terminating Company

if such Terminating NGA Breach is curable by NGA, the Company may not

in this Agreement or in any certificate, statement or instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement, including any rights arising out of any breach of
such representations, warranties, covenants, obligations, agreements and
other provisions, shall survive the Closing and all such representations,

agreements contained herein that by their terms expressly apply in whole or in

after the Closing and (b) this _Article X_ and any corresponding definitions
set forth in _Article I_.

  



  

10.03   _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse

invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order
that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Agreements constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede, except as set forth in _Section
7.05(b)_, all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof, except for the Confidentiality Agreement. This Agreement shall not be
assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of Law or otherwise) by
any party without the prior express written consent of the other parties.

  



    

72

 



    



  

10.05   _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party, and nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right,

Agreement, other than _Section 7.06_ (which is intended to be for the
benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons).

  



  

10.06   _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
executed in and to be performed in that State; _provided_ , _however_

pertaining to the internal corporate governance of the Company, including,
the interpretation of the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Company in connection with this Agreement and the Merger.
All legal actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in any Delaware Chancery
Court; _provided_ , that if jurisdiction is not then available in the
Delaware Chancery Court, then any such legal Action may be brought in any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware state
court. The parties (a) irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the aforesaid courts for themselves and with respect to their respective
properties for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) agree not to commence any
Action relating thereto except in the courts described above in Delaware,
other than Actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any
judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as described
herein. Each of the parties further agrees that notice as provided herein
shall constitute sufficient service of process and the parties further waive
any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the parties
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, (c) any claim that it
is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as
described herein for any reason, (d) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced
in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to
judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (e) that (i) the Action in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Action is improper or (iii) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

  



  

10.07   _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties waives to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury
with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or
in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each of the parties
(a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in
the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter into this
Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other things, the
mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 10.07_.

  



  

10.08   _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are
included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



    

73

 



    



  

10.09   _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or portable document format (pdf) transmission via
email) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  



  

10.10   _Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a)  The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof,
and, accordingly, that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties'
obligation to consummate the Merger) in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, County of Newcastle, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction,
any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware without proof
of actual damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at Law or in equity as expressly permitted in this Agreement.
Each of the parties further waives (i) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement
under any Law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if prior to
the Outside Date any party initiates an Action to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, then the Outside Date will be automatically
extended by: (i) the amount of time during which such Action is pending plus
twenty (20) Business Days; or (ii) such other time period established by the
court presiding over such Action.

  



  

10.11 _No Recourse_. All claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of
action (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity or otherwise, or
granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of
the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any
other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) that may be based
upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or

or the other Transaction Documents), may be made only against (and such
representations and warranties are those solely of) the persons that are
expressly identified as parties to this Agreement or the applicable
Transaction Document (the " _Contracting Parties_ ") except as set forth in
this _Section 10.11_. In no event shall any Contracting Party have any
shared or vicarious liability for the actions or omissions of any other
person. No person who is not a Contracting Party, including any current,
former or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
manager, stockholder, shareholder, affiliate, agent, financing source,
attorney or Representative or assignee of any Contracting Party, or any
current, former or future director, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, manager, stockholder, shareholder affiliate, agent,
financing source, attorney or Representative or assignee of any of the
foregoing (collectively, the " _Nonparty Affiliates_ "), shall have any
liability (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity or otherwise,
or granted by statute or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing
of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil or any
other theory or doctrine, including alter ego or otherwise) for any
obligations or liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or
related in any manner to this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents or their negotiation, execution, performance, or
breach, except with respect to willful misconduct or common law fraud against
the person who committed such willful misconduct or common law fraud, and,
to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law; and each party hereto
waives and releases all such liabilities, claims, causes of action and
obligations against any such Nonparty Affiliates. The Nonparty Affiliates are
intended third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 10.11_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, none of the Contracting Parties or any
Nonparty Affiliate shall be responsible or liable for any multiple,
consequential, indirect, special, statutory, exemplary or punitive damages
which may be alleged as a result of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents
or any other agreement referenced herein or therein or the Transactions, or
the termination or abandonment of any of the foregoing.

to Section 3.1.2(b)(ii), at least one (1) Nominee designated by each
Principal Shareholder must be an Independent Director as determined by the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and, if no Nominee of a
Principal Shareholder is determined to be an Independent Director, such
Principal Shareholder will be entitled to designate a replacement Nominee. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Each designated Nominee of a Principal Shareholder shall be
considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to ensure
that the Nominees, when considered collectively with the additional
individuals selected by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for
nomination to the Board, represent the characteristics, experience, skill
set, independence and diversity desired by the Board. The Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee may, at its discretion, advise a Principal
Shareholder that inclusion of any designated Nominee does not satisfy the
objectives of the Board and, in such circumstance, such Principal Shareholder
shall be entitled to propose a replacement for such Nominee. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

\- 4 -

 



    



   | (d)| For so long as a Principal Shareholder has the right to designate
one or more Nominees under Section 3.1.2, and provided that each Nominee (or
any replacement thereof which a Principal Shareholder has the right to
designate hereunder) has received a favourable recommendation of the
Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee, the Company shall nominate for
election and include in any management information circular relating to any
Director Election Meeting (or submit to shareholders by written consent if
applicable) each person designated as Nominee of such Principal Shareholder
and take all steps which may be necessary or appropriate to recognize,
enforce and comply with the rights of any Principal Shareholder under this
Section 3.1. 
---|---|--- 
  

  



   | (e)| Subject to Section 3.1.7, each Shareholder Group shall vote or
cause to be voted all Common Shares that it holds, directly or indirectly, or
over which it exercises control or direction, in favor of any Nominee
designated by a Principal Shareholder and at any Director Election Meeting,
pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of this Section 3.1. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Section 3.1.4. _Other Nominees_. The selection of Nominees other than the
Nominees designated by the Principal Shareholders pursuant to Section
3.1.2 (including when any designation right of a Principal Shareholder has
not been exercised pursuant thereto), shall rest with the Board, or the
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, if so determined by the Board.

  



  

Section 3.1.5. _Number of Board Members_. The Board shall initially consist
of nine (9) members and thereafter shall consist of such other number as may
be determined by the Board, provided that, in each case, the number of
Directors shall be sufficient to give effect to the rights of each Principal
Shareholder hereunder and under any other then existing obligation of the
Company in respect thereof, in each case subject to any minimum or maximum
number of Directors as provided under the Company's Articles. Each
Shareholder Group will cast all votes attached to all Common Shares held by
such Shareholder Group, whether at any annual or special meeting by written
consent or otherwise, to give effect to the foregoing.

  



  

Section 3.1.6. _Replacement Appointment_. If any Nominee of a Principal
Shareholder resigns, is removed, or is unable to serve for any reason prior to
the expiration of his or her term as a Director, then such Principal
Shareholder shall be entitled to designate a replacement to be appointed by
the Board as Director as soon as reasonably practicable, except where such
Principal Shareholder would have otherwise ceased to be entitled to designate
such Nominee pursuant to Section 3.1.2. The appointment of any such
replacement shall be subject to the approval thereof by the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with Section 3.1.3(c).

  



  

Section 3.1.7. _Cessation; Resignation_. Any Principal Shareholder shall
cease to have any rights or obligations under this Section 3.1 immediately
upon ceasing to have the right to designate any Nominee pursuant to the terms
of Section 3.1.2. In the event that a Principal Shareholder ceases to have
the right to designate a Nominee pursuant to the terms of Section 3.1.2, such
Principal Shareholder shall concurrently therewith, if requested by the
Board, use its reasonable efforts to promptly obtain and deliver to the
Company the written resignation of any Director previously designated by it
pursuant to the terms of Section 3.1.2 such that the number of Directors
nominated by such Principal Shareholder and then serving on the Board does
not exceed the number of Nominees that such Principal Shareholder would then
have the right to designate pursuant to the terms of Section 3.1.2.

  



  

Section 3.1.8. _Qualifications_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, all Directors (including Directors designated by the Principal
Shareholders) shall, at all times while serving on the Board, meet the
qualification requirements to serve as a director under the QBCA,
applicable securities laws and the rules of any stock exchange on which the
Common Shares are listed.

  



  

   

\- 5 -

 



    



  

Section 3.1.9. _Chairman_. So long as PEC has the right to designate a
Nominee pursuant to Section 3.1.2, PEC shall have the right to designate one
(1) of the PEC Directors to serve as Chairman of the Board. The Initial
Chairman of the Board will be Pierre Larochelle. In the event that PEC does
not have the right to designate the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of
the Board shall be selected by the Board from among the Directors comprising
the Board. In the event that the Chairman of the Board is not an Independent
Director, the remaining Directors shall designate a lead
independent director. The Chairman of the Board shall not be a past or
present CEO of the Company.

  



  

Section 3.1.10. _Board Committees._

  



   | (a)| The Board shall establish and maintain committees of the Board
(each a "Committee" and collectively, the "Committees") as required by
regulations, the rules of any stock exchange or as determined appropriate by
the Board. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| The size of each Committee shall be established by the Board
provided that the number of Committee members for each such Committee shall be
at least equal to the number of Principal Shareholders having the right to
appoint Nominees pursuant to the terms of Section 3.1.2, plus one (1) (which,
as of the date hereof, corresponds to three (3) Committee members).  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| The Committees and their composition shall initially consist of
the following:  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (i)| Audit Committee: [●] (Chair), [●], and [●];  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| Human Resources and Compensation Committee: [●] (Chair), [●]
and [●]; and  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee: [●] (Chair),
[●] and [●].   
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| For so long as a Principal Shareholder has a right to designate a
Nominee pursuant to the terms of Section 3.1.2, each such Principal
Shareholder shall have the right to appoint one member of each Committee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the CEO nor 9368-2672 shall have the
right to appoint any Director to the Human Resources and Compensation
Committee. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (e)| Each Committee shall be composed of at least a majority of
Independent Directors. Except as restricted by applicable laws and
regulations, Committees will be allowed to be composed of independent and non-
independent directors.

Section 3.1.11. _Non-Assignability or Transfer of Rights_. None of the rights
or obligations of any Shareholder Group under this Agreement shall be
assignable or transferable to any Person, provided however that each Principal
Shareholder may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another member
of its Shareholder Group together with a transfer of Common Shares to such
member, provided that such assignee (if not already a party hereto) executes a
joinder to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the transfer by a
Principal Shareholder to another member of its Shareholder Group shall not
relieve any member of such Shareholder Group from its obligations hereunder.

  



  

Section 3.1.12. _Shareholder Approval_. At the first annual meeting of the
shareholders of the Company to be held following the fifth (5th) anniversary
of the date of this Agreement, and at every fifth (5th) annual meeting of the
shareholders of the Company thereafter, the rights of any Principal
Shareholders under Section 3.1.2(a) shall be submitted to the shareholders of
the Company for approval by a simple majority (>50%) of the votes cast by the
shareholders of the Company represented in person or by proxy at such meeting
(provided that, for greater certainty, all shareholders of the Company shall
be entitled to vote with respect to such approval). If such rights are
approved by shareholders of the Company in accordance with the foregoing, the
rights of any Principal Shareholders under Section 3.1.2(a) shall continue in
full force and effect until the next shareholder meeting at which such rights
must be submitted for approval. If at any such meeting the requisite
shareholder approval is not obtained, the rights of any Principal
Shareholders under Section 3.1.2(a) shall become void and shall have no
further force and effect.

    



  

Section 3.2. _Expenses_.

  



  

Section 3.2.1. The Company shall reimburse the members of the Board for all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
attendance at meetings of the Board and any committees thereof, including
travel, lodging and meal expenses.

  



  

Section 3.2.2. The Company shall obtain customary director and officer
liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms.

Permitted Transferees, at least 10% of the outstanding Common Shares (on a
non-diluted basis), shall have the right to make a written request from time
to time (a " _Demand Registration Request_ ") to the Company for Registration
of all or part of the Registrable Securities held by such Principal
Shareholders. Any such Registration pursuant to a Demand Registration Request
shall hereinafter be referred to as a " _Demand Registration_."

intended method or methods of disposition thereof and (z) the
jurisdiction(s) in which the Registration is to take place. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| Upon receipt of a Demand Registration Request, the Company shall

reasonable best efforts to cause such Demand Registration Statement to be
promptly declared effective under the Securities Act, and/or, as may be

reliance review decision document for a Canadian Preliminary Prospectus (a "

Section 3.1.1 (but in no event more than two (2) Business Days thereafter),

request in writing. Subject to Section 3.1.7, the Company shall include in
the Demand Registration all such Registrable Securities with respect to which
the Company has received written requests for inclusion therein within three
(3) Business Days after the date that the Demand Notice was delivered. In the
event that a Demand Registration is made in connection with a Bought Deal, the
notice periods set forth in this Section 3.1.3 shall not be applicable and
the Company shall give the other Holders such notice as is practicable under
the circumstances given the speed and urgency with which Bought Deals are
currently carried out in common market practice of its rights to participate

and the requesting Holder that they will participate in the Bought Deal,
failing which, the requesting Holder shall be free to pursue the Bought
Deal without the participation of such other Holders.

or, if such Demand Registration Statement relates to an Underwritten Public
Offering, such longer period as in the opinion of counsel for the
underwriter or underwriters a U.S. Prospectus is required by law to be
delivered in connection with sales of Registrable Securities by an
underwriter or dealer, and (b) from the period beginning on the filing of any
Demand Canadian Preliminary Prospectus or Demand Canadian Prospectus until

later), comply with section 57 of the _Securities Act_ (Ontario) and the
comparable provisions of other applicable Canadian Securities Laws, and

Section 3.1.6.   _Delay in Filing; Suspension of Registration_. If the
filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of a Demand
Registration Statement or the filing or continued use of a Demand Canadian
Preliminary Prospectus or Demand Canadian Prospectus (including pursuant to

Disclosure, the Company may, upon giving prompt written notice of such action
to the Holders, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use
of, as applicable, the Demand Registration Statement, Demand Canadian
Preliminary Prospectus or Demand Canadian Prospectus (a " _Demand Suspension_

Demand Registration may not exceed sixty (60) days and Demand Suspensions in

the Holders agree to suspend use of any applicable U.S. Prospectus, Demand
Canadian Preliminary Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus in connection with any
sale or purchase, or offer to sell or purchase, Registrable Securities, upon
receipt of the notice referred to above. The Company shall immediately notify
the Holders in writing upon the termination of any Demand Suspension, amend
or supplement any U.S. Prospectus, if necessary, so it does not contain any
untrue statement or omission, amend or supplement any Demand Canadian
Preliminary Prospectus or Demand Canadian Prospectus, if necessary, so that
it contains full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to
the securities distributed thereunder and does not contain a
misrepresentation or if required by applicable Canadian Securities Laws or as

covered by such Demand Canadian Preliminary Prospectus or Demand Canadian
Prospectus, and furnish to the Holders such numbers of copies of any U.S.
Prospectus, Demand Canadian Preliminary Prospectus or Demand
Canadian Prospectus as so amended or supplemented as the Holders may
reasonably request. The Company shall, if necessary, supplement or amend any
Demand Registration Statement, if required by the registration form used by
the Company for the Demand Registration or by the instructions applicable to
such registration form or by the Securities Act or the rules or regulations
promulgated thereunder or as may reasonably be requested by the Holders of a
majority of Registrable Securities that are included in such Demand
Registration Statement.

  



  

Section 3.1.7.   _Priority of Securities Registered Pursuant to Demand
Registrations_. If the managing underwriter or underwriters of a
proposed Underwritten Public Offering of the Registrable Securities included
in a Demand Registration advise the Company in writing that, in its or their
opinion, the number of securities requested to be included in such Demand
Registration exceeds the number that can be sold in such offering without
being likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of
the securities offered or the market for the securities offered, then the
securities to be included in such Registration shall be, in the case of any
Demand Registration, (x) first, allocated to each Holder that has requested to
participate in such Demand Registration an amount equal to the lesser of (i)
the number of such Registrable Securities requested to be registered or sold
by such Holder, and (ii) a number of such shares equal to such Holder's Pro
Rata Portion, and (y) second, and only if all the securities referred to in
clause (x) have been included, the number of other securities that, in the
opinion of such managing underwriter or underwriters can be sold without
having such adverse effect.

Rule 415 under the Securities Act (each, a " _U.S. Shelf Registration
Statement_ ") relating to the offer and sale of Registrable Securities by
such Holders from time to time in accordance with the methods of
distribution elected by such Holders, and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such U.S. Shelf Registration Statement to
promptly become effective under the Securities Act. Any such Registration
pursuant to a U.S. Shelf Registration Request shall hereinafter be referred
to as a " _U.S. Shelf Registration_."  
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| If on the date of the U.S. Shelf Registration
Request contemplating the filing of a U.S. Shelf Registration Statement, the
Company is a WKSI, then the U.S. Shelf Registration Request may request

to be sold by unspecified Holders. If on the date of the U.S. Shelf
Registration Request the Company is not a WKSI, then the U.S. Shelf
Registration Request shall specify the aggregate amount of Registrable
Securities to be registered. The Company shall provide to the Holders the
information necessary to determine the Company's status as a WKSI upon
request.  
---|---|---

owned by such Holders on the date hereof promptly following the closing of
the Business Combination.

U.S. Shelf Registration Request (but in no event more than two (2) Business
Days thereafter (or such shorter period as may be reasonably requested in
connection with a Bought Deal)), the Company shall deliver a written notice
(a " _U.S. Shelf Registration Notice_ ") of any such request to all other
Holders, which notice shall specify, if applicable, the amount of Registrable
Securities to be registered, and the U.S. Shelf Registration Notice shall
offer each such Holder the opportunity to include in the U.S. Shelf
Registration that number of Registrable Securities as each such Holder may
request in writing. The Company shall include in such U.S. Shelf Registration
all such Registrable Securities with respect to which the Company has
received written requests for inclusion therein within three (3) Business Days
(or such shorter period as may be reasonably requested in connection with a
Bought Deal provided such period is at least 24 hours) after the date that
the U.S. Shelf Registration Notice has been delivered; _provided_ , _however_
, that if the Holder, is not, or is not controlled (directly or indirectly)
by, a director or officer of the Company, such time for providing written
requests for inclusion shall be extended to five (5) Business Days (or such
shorter period as may be reasonably requested in connection with a Bought
Deal provided such period is at least 24 hours).

U.S. Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective under the Securities
Act in order to permit the U.S. Prospectus forming part of the U.S. Shelf
Registration Statement to be usable by Holders until the earlier of: (i) the
date as of which all Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant to the
U.S. Shelf Registration Statement as part of another Registration (but in no
event prior to the applicable period referred to in Section 4(a)(3) of the
Securities Act and Rule 174 thereunder); and (ii) the date as of which no
Holder holds Registrable Securities (such period of effectiveness, the " _U.S.
Shelf Period_ "). Subject to Section 3.2.4, the Company shall be deemed not
to have used its reasonable best efforts to keep the U.S. Shelf
Registration Statement effective during the U.S. Shelf Period if the Company
voluntarily takes any action or omits to take any action that would result in
Holders of the Registrable Securities covered thereby not being able to offer
and sell any Registrable Securities pursuant to such U.S. Shelf Registration
Statement during the U.S. Shelf Period, unless such action or omission is
required by applicable law.

  



  

Section 3.2.4.   _Suspension of U.S. Shelf Registration_. If the continued
use of such U.S. Shelf Registration Statement at any time would require the
Company to make an Adverse Disclosure, the Company may, upon giving prompt
written notice of such action to the Holders, suspend use of the U.S. Shelf
Registration Statement (a " _U.S. Shelf Suspension_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company shall not be permitted to exercise a U.S. Shelf Suspension
more than sixty (60) consecutive days or more than one hundred twenty (120)
days during any twelve (12) month period. In the case of a U.S. Shelf
Suspension, the Holders agree to suspend use of the applicable U.S.
Prospectus in connection with any sale or purchase of, or offer to sell or
purchase, Registrable Securities, upon receipt of the notice referred to
above. The Company shall immediately notify the Holders in writing upon
the termination of any U.S. Shelf Suspension, amend or supplement the U.S.
Prospectus, if necessary, so it does not contain any untrue statement or
omission and furnish to the Holders such numbers of copies of the U.S.
Prospectus as so amended or supplemented as the Holders may reasonably
request. The Company shall, if necessary, supplement or amend the U.S. Shelf
Registration Statement, if required by the registration form used by the
Company for the U.S. Shelf Registration Statement or by the instructions
applicable to such registration form or by the Securities Act or the rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder or as may reasonably be requested by the
Holders of a majority of Registrable Securities that are included in such U.S.
Shelf Registration Statement.

Registration Statement may make a written request (a " _U.S. Shelf Takedown
Request_ ") to the Company to effect a Public Offering, including an
Underwritten U.S. Shelf Takedown, of all or a portion of such Registrable
Securities that may be registered under such U.S. Shelf Registration
Statement, and as soon as practicable the Company shall amend or supplement
the U.S. Shelf Registration Statement as necessary for such purpose. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| Promptly upon receipt of a U.S. Shelf Takedown Request (but in no
event more than two (2) Business Days thereafter (or such shorter period as
may be reasonably requested in connection with a Bought Deal)) for any
Underwritten U.S. Shelf Takedown, the Company shall deliver a notice (a "
_U.S. Shelf Takedown Notice_ ") to each other Holder with Registrable

shall give written notice of such determination to each Holder and, thereupon,
(i) in the case of a determination not to register or sell, shall be relieved
of its obligation to register or sell any Registrable Securities in connection
with such Registration or Public Offering (but not from its obligation to pay
the Registration Expenses in connection therewith), without prejudice,
however, to the rights of any Holders entitled to request that such

Demand Registration or an Underwritten U.S. Shelf Takedown, as the case may

_Loss_ " and collectively " _Losses_ ") arising out of or based upon (i) (A)
any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Registration Statement under which Registrable Securities are registered or
sold under the Securities Act (including any final, preliminary or
summary U.S. Prospectus contained therein or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto or any documents incorporated by reference therein), or
(B) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case
of a U.S. Prospectus or preliminary U.S. Prospectus, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, (ii) any
information or statement in a Canadian Preliminary Prospectus or Canadian

omission of a Canadian Preliminary Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus to
contain full, true and plain disclosure of all material facts relating to the
securities distributed thereunder, (iii) any untrue or alleged untrue

liability the Company may otherwise have. Such indemnity shall remain in full

Section 3.9.2.   _Indemnification by the Selling Holders_. Each selling
Holder agrees (severally and not jointly) to indemnify and hold harmless, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company, its Directors and officers
and each Person who controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act or of analogous provisions under applicable Canadian Securities
Laws) or is deemed to control the Company from and against any Losses
resulting from (i) (A) any untrue statement of a material fact in
any Registration Statement under which such Registrable Securities were
registered or sold under the Securities Act (including any final, preliminary
or summary U.S. Prospectus contained therein or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto or any documents incorporated by reference therein) or (B)
any omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a U.S. Prospectus or
preliminary U.S. Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made) not misleading, or (ii) any information or statement in a Canadian
Preliminary Prospectus or Canadian Prospectus that contains a
misrepresentation, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that
such untrue statement or omission or such misrepresentation is contained in
such selling Holder's Selling Holder Information. In no event shall
the liability of any selling Holder hereunder be greater in amount than the
dollar amount of the proceeds from the sale of its Registrable Securities in
the offering giving rise to such indemnification obligation, net of
underwriting discounts and commissions but before expenses, less any amounts
paid by such Holder pursuant to Section 3.9.4 and any amounts paid by such
Holder as a result of liabilities incurred under the underwriting agreement,
if any, related to such sale.

  



  

Section 3.9.3.   _Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings_. Any Person
entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (a) give prompt written notice to
the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks
indemnification ( _provided_ that any delay or failure to so notify the
indemnifying party shall relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations
hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it forfeits substantive legal
rights by reason of such delay or failure) and (b) permit such indemnifying
party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to select
and employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim,
but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such
Person unless (i) the indemnifying party has agreed in writing to pay such
fees or expenses, (ii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the
defense of such claim within a reasonable time after receipt of notice of
such claim from the Person entitled to indemnification hereunder and employ
counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Person, (iii) the indemnified party
has reasonably concluded (based upon advice of its counsel) that there may be
legal defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different
from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party, or (iv) in
the reasonable judgment of any such Person (based upon advice of its counsel)
a conflict of interest may exist between such Person and the indemnifying
party with respect to such claims (in which case, if the Person notifies the
indemnifying party in writing that such Person elects to employ separate
counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party
shall not have the right to assume the defense of such claim on behalf of
such Person). If the indemnifying party assumes the defense, the indemnifying
party shall not have the right to settle such action without the consent of
the indemnified party. No indemnifying party shall consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
indemnified party of an unconditional release from all liability in respect
to such claim or litigation without the prior written consent of such
indemnified party. If such defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party,
the indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any
settlement made without its prior written consent, but such consent may not be
unreasonably withheld. It is understood that the indemnifying party or
parties shall not, except as specifically set forth in this Section 3.9.3, in
connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same
jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees, disbursements or
other charges of more than one separate firm admitted to practice in such
jurisdiction at any one time unless (x) the employment of more than one
counsel has been authorized in writing by the indemnifying party or parties,
(y) an indemnified party has reasonably concluded (based on the advice of
counsel) that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different
from or in addition to those available to the other indemnified parties or
(z) a conflict or potential conflict exists or may exist (based upon advice of
counsel to an indemnified party) between such indemnified party and the other
indemnified parties, in each of which cases the indemnifying party shall be
obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such additional counsel
or counsels.

  



  

Section 3.9.4.   _Contribution_. If for any reason the indemnification
provided for in Section 3.9.1 and Section 3.9.2 is unavailable to
an indemnified party or insufficient in respect of any Losses referred to
therein (other than as a result of exceptions or limitations on
indemnification contained in Section 3.9.1 and Section 3.9.2), then the
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on the
one hand and the indemnified party or parties on the other hand in connection
with the acts, statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well
as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the
indemnifying party on the one hand and the indemnified party on the other
hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things whether any
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or misrepresentation or
the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party,
and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement, misrepresentation or
omission. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just or equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 3.9.4 were determined by _pro rata_
 allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account
of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 3.9.4. No Person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The amount paid or payable
by an indemnified party as a result of the Losses referred to in Section 3.9.1
and Section 3.9.2 shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 3.9.4,
in connection with any Registration effected pursuant to this Agreement, a
selling Holder shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of
the dollar amount of the proceeds from the sale of its Registrable Securities
in the offering giving rise to such indemnification obligation, net of
underwriting discounts and commissions but before expenses, less any amounts
paid by such Holder pursuant to Section 3.9.2 and any amounts paid by such
Holder as a result of liabilities incurred under the underwriting agreement,
if any, related to such Registration. If indemnification is available under
this Section 3.9, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified
party to the full extent provided in Section 3.9.1 and Section 3.9.2 hereof
without regard to the provisions of this Section 3.9.4. The remedies provided
for in this Section 3.9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or
remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or
in equity.

Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder (or,
if the Company is not required to file such reports, it will, upon the
request of any Holder, make publicly available such necessary information for
so long as necessary to permit sales that would otherwise be permitted by
this Agreement pursuant to Rule 144, Rule 144A or Regulation S under the
Securities Act, as such rules may be amended from time to time or any similar
rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC), and it will take such
further action as any Holder may reasonably request, all to the extent
required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Registrable
Securities without Registration under the Securities Act in transactions that
would otherwise be permitted by this Agreement and within the limitation of
the exemptions provided by (i) Rule 144, Rule 144A or Regulation S under
the Securities Act, as such rules may be amended from time to time, or (ii)
any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the request
of any Holder, the Company will deliver to such Holder a written statement as
to whether it has complied with such requirements and, if not, the specifics
thereof.

  



  

Section 3.11.   _Compliance with Canadian Securities Laws_. With a view to
making available the benefits of Canadian Securities Laws that may at any
time permit the resale of Registrable Securities without the filing of a
Canadian Prospectus, at all times after the Company becoming a reporting
issuer or the equivalent under Canadian Securities Laws in any province or
territory of Canada, the Company agrees to use is reasonable best efforts to
(a) file with the appropriate Canadian Securities Authority authorities in a
timely manner all reports and other documents required under Canadian
Securities Laws, and (b) so long as any Holder owns any Registrable
Securities, furnish to any Holder forthwith upon request a written statement
by the Company stating that the Company is a reporting issuer and is not in
default of any requirement under Canadian Securities Laws.

  



  

Section 3.12.   _Short Form Registrations_. After the Company becoming a
reporting issuer or the equivalent under Canadian Securities Laws in any
province or territory of Canada, the Company agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to make available and maintain the availability of short form
prospectus Registrations pursuant to NI 44-101. For greater certainty,
references herein to a Canadian Preliminary Prospectus or a Canadian
Prospectus shall as applicable include a short form Canadian Preliminary
Prospectus or a short form Canadian Prospectus.

Article I 
 OFFICES

  



  

Section 1.1. Registered Office. The registered office of Northern Genesis
Acquisition Corp. required by the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") to be maintained in the State of Delaware, shall be
the registered office named in the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation (as the same may be amended and
restated from time to time, the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ "), or such
other office as may be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors
of the Corporation (the " _Board_ ") in the manner provided by law. Should
the Corporation maintain a principal office within the State of Delaware such
registered office need not be identical to such principal office of the
Corporation.

  



  

Section 1.2. Additional Offices. The Corporation may have offices at such
other places both within and without the State of Delaware as the Board may
from time to time determine or as the business and affairs of the Corporation
may require.

  



  

Article II 
 STOCKHOLDERS

  



  

Section 2.1. Place of Meetings. All meetings of the stockholders shall be
held at the principal office of the Corporation, or at such other place
within or without the State of Delaware as shall be specified or fixed in the
notices or waivers of notice thereof.

  



  

Section 2.2. Quorum; Adjournment of Meetings. Unless otherwise required by
law or provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the
holders of shares of stock with a majority of the voting power entitled to
vote thereat, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a
quorum at any meeting of stockholders for the transaction of business. The
stockholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact
business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough
stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Shares of the Corporation's stock
belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if such shares of
stock representing a majority of the voting power entitled to vote in the
election of directors of such other corporation are held, directly or
indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be
counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
limit the right of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation to
vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a
fiduciary capacity.

  



  

Notwithstanding the other provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or
these Bylaws, the chairman of the meeting or the holders of shares of stock
with a majority of the voting power present in person or represented by proxy
at any meeting of stockholders, whether or not a quorum is present, shall
have the power to adjourn such meeting from time to time, without any notice
other than announcement at the meeting of the time and place of the holding
of the adjourned meeting; provided, however, if the adjournment is for more
than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed
for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. At any
such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented any
business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as
originally called.

  



  

   

1

 



    



  

Section 2.3. Annual Meetings. An annual meeting of the stockholders, for the
election of directors to succeed those whose terms expire and for the
transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting,
shall be held at such place, within or without the State of Delaware, on such
date, and at such time as the Board shall fix and set forth in the notice of
the meeting, which date shall be within thirteen (13) months subsequent to
the later of the date of incorporation or the last annual meeting of
stockholders.

  



  

Section 2.4. Special Meetings. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate
of Incorporation, special meetings of the stockholders for any purpose or
purposes may be called at any time by the Chairman of the Board (if any), by
the Chief Executive Officer or by a majority of the Board, or by a majority
of the executive committee (if any), and shall be called by the Chairman of
the Board (if any), by the Chief Executive Officer or the Secretary upon the
written request therefor, stating the purpose or purposes of the
meeting, delivered to such officer, signed by the holder(s) of at least
twenty-five percent (25%) of the issued and outstanding stock entitled to
vote at such meeting.

  



  

Section 2.5. Record Date. For the purpose of determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or any
adjournment thereof, or entitled to express consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or
other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any
rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the
purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix, in advance, a date
as the record date for any such determination of stockholders, which date
shall not be more than sixty (60) days nor less than ten (10) days before the
date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action.

  



  

If the Board does not fix a record date for any meeting of the stockholders,
the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote
at such meeting shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding
the day on which notice is given, or, if in accordance with _Article VIII_ ,
_Section 3_ of these Bylaws notice is waived, at the close of business on the
day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. If, in accordance
with _Section 12_ of this _Article II_ , corporate action without a meeting
of stockholders is to be taken, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to express consent to such corporate action in writing, when no
prior action by the Board is necessary, shall be the day on which the first
written consent is expressed. The record date for determining stockholders
for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which
the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.

  



  

A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at
a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the
meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the
adjourned meeting.

  



  

Section 2.6. Notice of Meetings. Written notice of the place, date and hour
of all meetings, and, in case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes
for which the meeting is called, shall be given by or at the direction of the
Chairman of the Board (if any) or the Chief Executive Officer, the Secretary
or the other person(s) calling the meeting to each stockholder entitled to
vote thereat and shall be delivered not less than ten (10) nor more than
sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, personally, by
electronic transmission or by mail. If mailed, notice is given when deposited
in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at
his or her address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. The
Corporation may provide stockholders with notice of a meeting by electronic
transmission provided such stockholders have consented to receiving electronic
notice.

  



  

   

2

 



    



  

Section 2.7. Stock List. A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at
any meeting of stockholders, arranged in alphabetical order for each class of
stock and showing the address of each such stockholder and the number of
shares registered in the name of such stockholder, shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during
ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the
meeting, either on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that
the information required to gain access to the list is provided with the
notice of the meeting, or during ordinary business hours, at the principal
place of business of the Corporation. The stock list shall also be produced
and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof,
and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the meeting is to
be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list shall also be
open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the
meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information
required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of the
meeting.

  



  

Section 2.8. Proxies. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders or to express consent or dissent to a corporate action in
writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for
him by proxy. Proxies for use at any meeting of stockholders shall be filed
with the Secretary, or such other officer as the Board may from time to time
determine by resolution, before or at the time of the meeting. All proxies
shall be received and taken charge of and all ballots shall be received and
canvassed by the secretary of the meeting who shall decide all questions
touching upon the qualification of voters, the validity of the proxies, and
the acceptance or rejection of votes, unless an inspector or inspectors shall
have been appointed by the chairman of the meeting, in which event such
inspector or inspectors shall decide all such questions.

  



  

No proxy shall be valid after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy
provides for a longer period. Each proxy shall be revocable unless
expressly provided therein to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power.

  



  

Should a proxy designate two or more persons to act as proxies, unless such
instrument shall provide the contrary, a majority of such persons present
at any meeting at which their powers thereunder are to be exercised shall
have and may exercise all the powers of voting or giving consents thereby
conferred, or if only one be present, then such powers may be exercised by
that one; or, if an even number attend and a majority do not agree on any
particular issue, each proxy so attending shall be entitled to exercise such
powers in respect of the same portion of the shares as he or she is of the
proxies representing such shares.

  



  

Section 2.9. Voting; Elections; Inspectors. Unless otherwise required by law
or provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder shall have
one vote for each share of stock entitled to vote which is registered in his
or her name on the record date for the meeting. Shares registered in the name
of another corporation, domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer,
agent or proxy as the bylaw (or comparable instrument) of such corporation
may prescribe, or in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors
(or comparable body) of such corporation may determine. Shares registered in
the name of a deceased person may be voted by his or her executor or
administrator, either in person or by proxy.

  



  

   

3

 



    



  

All voting, except as required by the Certificate of Incorporation or where
otherwise required by law, may be a voice vote; _provided, however_ , that
upon demand therefor by stockholders holding shares of stock representing a
majority of the voting power present in person or by proxy at any meeting, a
written ballot vote shall be taken. Unless otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, directors shall be elected by a
plurality of the votes cast by the holders of shares of stock entitled to
vote in the election of directors at a meeting of stockholders at which a
quorum is present. All other elections and questions presented to the
stockholders at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall, unless otherwise
provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, the rules or
regulations of any stock exchange applicable to the Corporation, or applicable
law or pursuant to any regulation applicable to the Corporation or its
securities, be decided by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
in voting power of the shares of stock of the Corporation which are present
in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereon. Any stock vote taken by
written ballots shall state the name of the stockholder or proxy voting and
such other information as may be required under the procedure established for
the meeting.

  



  

At any meeting at which a vote is taken by ballots, the chairman of the
meeting may appoint one or more inspectors, each of whom shall subscribe an
oath or affirmation to execute faithfully the duties of inspector at such
meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her
ability. Such inspector shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital
stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share,
(ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at
the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes
and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of
the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors,
and (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of capital stock
of the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectors' count of
all votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other
information as may be required by law. In determining the validity and
counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted by
applicable law. The chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to serve as
inspector, except no candidate for the office of director shall be appointed
as an inspector.

  



  

Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, cumulative
voting for the election of directors shall be prohibited.

  



  

Section 2.10. Conduct of Meetings. The meetings of the stockholders shall be
presided over by the Chairman of the Board (if any), or if he or she is not
present, by the Chief Executive Officer, or if neither the Chairman of the
Board (if any), nor Chief Executive Officer is present, by a chairman elected
at the meeting. The Secretary of the Corporation, if present, shall act as
secretary of such meetings, or if he or she is not present, an Assistant
Secretary (if any) shall so act; if neither the Secretary nor an
Assistant Secretary (if any) is present, then a secretary shall be appointed
by the chairman of the meeting. The chairman of any meeting of stockholders
shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting,
including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of
discussion as seem to him in order.

  



  

   

4

 



    



  

Section 2.11. Treasury Stock. The Corporation shall not vote, directly or
indirectly, shares of its own stock owned by it or any other corporation, if
a majority of shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such
other corporation is held, directly or indirectly by the Corporation and such
shares shall not be counted for quorum purposes.

  



  

Section 2.12. Action Without Meeting. Unless otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation, any action permitted or required by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws to be taken at a meeting of
stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken,
shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present
and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a
meeting by less than a unanimous written consent shall be given by the
Secretary to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.

  



  

Article III

Section 3.1. Power; Number; Term of Office. The business and affairs of the

subject to the restrictions imposed by law or the Certificate of
Incorporation, they may exercise all the powers of the Corporation.

  



  

The number of directors of the Corporation shall be determined from time to
time by resolution of the Board, unless the Certificate of Incorporation
fixes the number of directors, in which case a change in the number of
directors shall be made only by amendment of the Certificate
of Incorporation. Each director shall hold office for the term for which he
or she is elected, and until his or her successor shall have been elected and
qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal.

  



  

Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, directors need
not be stockholders nor residents of the State of Delaware.

  



  

Section 3.2. Quorum. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation, a majority of the total number of directors shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business of the Board and the vote of a majority
of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be
the act of the Board.

  



  

Section 3.3. Place of Meetings; Order of Business. The directors may hold
their meetings and may have an office and keep the books of the Corporation,
except as otherwise provided by law, in such place or places, within or
without the State of Delaware, as the Board may from time to time determine
by resolution. At all meetings of the Board business shall be transacted in
such order as shall from time to time be determined by the Chairman of the
Board (if any), or in his or her absence by the Chief Executive Officer, or
by resolution of the Board.

  



  

Section 3.4. First Meeting. Each newly elected Board may hold its first
meeting for the purpose of organization and the transaction of business, if a
quorum is present, immediately after and at the same place as the annual
meeting of the stockholders. Notice of such meeting shall not be required.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

Section 3.5. Regular Meetings. Regular meetings of the Board shall be held at
such times and places as shall be designated from time to time by resolution
of the Board. Notice of such regular meetings shall not be required.

the Chairman of the Board (if any), the Chief Executive Officer or, on the
written request of any two directors, by the Secretary, in each case on at
least twenty-four (24) hours personal or written notice or on at least
twenty-four (24) hours' notice by electronic transmission to each director.
Such notice, or any waiver thereof pursuant to _Article VIII_ , _Section 3_
hereof, need not state the purpose or purposes of such meeting, except as may
otherwise be required by law or provided for in the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws.

  



  

Section 3.7. Removal. Any director or the entire Board may be removed, with
or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to
vote at an election of directors; provided that, unless the Certificate of
Incorporation otherwise provides, if the Board is classified, then the
stockholders may effect such removal only for cause; and provided further
that, if the Certificate of Incorporation expressly grants to stockholders
the right to cumulate votes for the election of directors and if less than
the entire Board is to be removed, no director may be removed without cause
if the votes cast against his or her removal would be sufficient to elect him
or her if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire Board, or, if
there be classes of directors, at an election of the class of directors of
which such director is a part.

  



  

Section 3.8. Vacancies; Increases in the Number of Directors. Unless
otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies and newly
created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of
directors may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office,
although less than a quorum, or a sole remaining director; and any director so
chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and until his or her
successor shall be duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced.

  



  

If the directors of the Corporation are divided into classes, any directors
elected to fill vacancies or newly created directorships shall hold
office until the next election of the class for which such directors shall
have been chosen, and until their successors shall be duly elected and shall
qualify.

  



  

Section 3.9. Compensation. Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of
Incorporation, the Board shall have the authority to fix the compensation of
directors.

  



  

Section 3.10. Action Without a Meeting; Telephone Conference Meeting. Unless
otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required
or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board, or any committee
designated by the Board, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the
Board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by
electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic
transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the
Board or committee. Such consent shall have the same force and effect as a

Article VI 
 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS

  



  

Section 6.1. Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is made a party
or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any threatened,
pending or completed claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a
"proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she or a person of whom he or
she is the legal representative, is or was or has agreed to become a director
or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving or has agreed to serve at
the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether
the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a
director or officer or in any other capacity while serving or having agreed to
serve as a director or officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as the same exists
or may hereafter be amended, (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to
the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide
prior to such amendment) against all cost or expense, liability and loss
(including without limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines,
damages, ERISA excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection
therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to serve in the capacity which initially entitled such person to
indemnity hereunder and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs,
executors and administrators; provided, however, that the Corporation shall
indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof), other than a proceeding (or part thereof)
brought under _Section 3_ of this _Article VI_ , initiated by such person or
his or her heirs, executors and administrators only if such proceeding (or
part thereof) was authorized by the Board. The right to indemnification
conferred in this _Article VI_ shall be a contract right and shall include the
right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any
such proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that,
if the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses incurred by a current,
former or proposed director or officer in his or her capacity as a director
or officer or proposed director or officer (and not in any other capacity in
which service was or is or has been agreed to be rendered by such person
while a director or officer, including, without limitation, service to an
employee benefit plan) in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding,
shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or
on behalf of such indemnified person, to repay all amounts so advanced if it
shall ultimately be determined that such indemnified person is not entitled
to be indemnified under this Section or otherwise.

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

Section 6.2. Indemnification of Employees and Agents. The Corporation may, by
action of its Board, provide indemnification to employees and agents of the
Corporation, individually or as a group, with the same scope and effect as the
indemnification of directors and officers provided for in this _Article VI_.

  



  

Section 6.3. Right of Claimant to Bring Suit. If a written claim received by
the Corporation from or on behalf of an indemnified party under this _Article
VI_ is not paid in full by the Corporation within ninety (90) days after such
receipt, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other
than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending
any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required
undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that
the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible
under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount
claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation.
Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant
is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the
Corporation (including its Board, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

  



  

Section 6.4. Non-exclusivity of Rights. The right to indemnification and the
advancement and payment of expenses conferred in this _Article VI_ shall not
be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire
under any law (common or statutory), provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Corporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise.

  



  

Section 6.5. No Personal Liability. No director or officer of the Corporation
shall be personally liable to the Corporation or to any stockholder of the
Corporation for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or
officer, provided that this provision shall not limit the liability of a
director or officer (i) for any breach of the director's or the officer's duty
of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions
not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of
Delaware, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director or officer
derived an improper personal benefit.

  



  

   

11

 



    



  

Section 6.6. Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its
expense, to protect itself and any person who is or was serving as a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving
at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would
have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or
loss under the DGCL.

  



  

Section 6.7. Savings Clause. If this _Article VI_ or any portion hereof shall
be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall nevertheless indemnify and hold harmless each director and
officer of the Corporation (each, a " _Covered Person_ "), as to costs,
charges and expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, and
amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative to the full extent
permitted by any applicable portion of this _Article VI_ that shall not have
been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Any
repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this _Article VI_ shall
not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any Covered Person
in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such repeal
or modification.

  



  

Section 6.8. Definitions. For purposes of this Article, reference to the
"Corporation" shall include, in addition to the Corporation, any constituent
corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a
consolidation or merger prior to (or, in the case of an entity specifically
designated in a resolution of the Board, after) the adoption hereof and which,
if its separate existence had continued, would have had the power and
authority to indemnify its directors, officers and employees or agents,
so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall
stand in the same position under the provisions of this _Article VI_ with
respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have
with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had
continued.

  



  

Article VII 
 CAPITAL STOCK

  



  

Section 7.1. Certificates of Stock. Except as provided in this _Section 7.1_
of _Article VII_ , the certificates for shares of the capital stock of the
Corporation shall be uncertificated, provided that the Board of Directors may
provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all classes of series of
the Corporation's stock shall be represented by certificates. Each
certificated share of stock shall be signed by the Chairman of the Board,
Chief Executive Officer or a Vice President and the Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary or the Chief Financial Officer or an Assistant Chief Financial
Officer certifying the number of shares (and, if the stock of the Corporation
shall be divided into classes or series, the class and series of such shares)
owned by the stockholder in the Corporation; provided, however, that any of
or all the signatures on the certificate may be facsimile. The stock
record books and the blank stock certificate books shall be kept by the
Secretary, or at the office of such transfer agent or transfer agents as the
Board may from time to time by resolution determine. In case any officer,
transfer agent or registrar who shall have signed or whose facsimile
signature or signatures shall have been placed upon any such certificate or
certificates shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or
registrar before such certificate is issued by the Corporation, such
certificate may nevertheless be issued by the Corporation with the same
effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the
date of issue.

  



  

   

12

 



    



  

Section 7.2. Transfer of Shares. Subject to the provisions of the Certificate
of Incorporation and any other applicable agreements regarding the transfer
of stock, the shares of stock of the Corporation shall be transferable only on
the books of the Corporation by the holders thereof in person or by their
duly authorized attorneys or legal representatives upon surrender and
cancellation of certificates for a like number of shares, duly endorsed or
accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority of
transfer or upon receipt of proper transfer instructions from the registered
holder of uncertificated shares and upon compliance with
appropriate procedures for transferring shares in uncertificated form.

  



  

Section 7.3. Ownership of Shares. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat
the holder of record of any share or shares of capital stock of the
Corporation as the holder in fact thereof and, accordingly, shall not be bound
to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or
shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express
or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of the
State of Delaware.

  



  

Section 7.4. Regulations Regarding Certificates. The Board shall have the
power and authority to make all such rules and regulations as they may deem
expedient concerning the issue, transfer and registration or the replacement
of certificates for shares of capital stock of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 7.5. Lost or Destroyed Certificates. The Board may determine the
conditions upon which a new certificate of stock may be issued in place of a
certificate which is alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed; and may,
in their discretion, require the owner of such certificate or his or her
legal representative to give bond, with sufficient surety, to indemnify the
Corporation and each transfer agent and registrar against any and all losses
or claims which may arise by reason of the issue of a new certificate in the
place of the one so lost, stolen or destroyed.

thereof, duplicates of the seal may be kept and used by the Chief Financial
Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Assistant Secretary or Assistant Chief
Financial Officer.

  



  

Section 8.3. Notice and Waiver of Notice. Whenever any notice is required to
be given by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or under the provisions of
these Bylaws, said notice shall be deemed to be sufficient if given (i) by
electronic transmission or (ii) by deposit of the same in a post office box
in a sealed prepaid wrapper addressed to the person entitled thereto at his or
her post office address, as it appears on the records of the Corporation, and
such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the day of such
transmission or mailing, as the case may be.

  



  

   

13

 



    



  

Whenever notice is required to be given by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or under any of the provisions of these Bylaws, a written
waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by
electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or
after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of
such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose
of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any
business on the grounds that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.
Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or

directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required
by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws.

member of any committee designated by the Board shall, in the performance of
his or her duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the books
of account or reports made to the Corporation by any of its officers, or by
an independent certified public accountant, or by an appraiser selected with
reasonable care by the Board or by any such committee, or in relying in good
faith upon other records of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 8.7. Form of Records. Any records maintained by the Corporation in
the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of
account, and minute books, may be kept on, or by means of, or be in the form
of, any information storage device or method, provided that the records so
kept can be converted into clearly legible paper form within a reasonable
time.

DIRECTORS

  



   | 3.1| Number.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Subject to the requirements of the Act applicable to reporting issuers, the
number of directors of the Corporation when a minimum number and a maximum
number are specified in the articles is, at any time, the number of directors
holding office immediately following the most recent election or appointment
of directors, whether by the shareholders at a meeting of the shareholders, or
by the Board pursuant to the Act.

     



  

No decrease in the number of directors will shorten the term of an incumbent
director.

  



   

- 2 - 

 



    



  

  



   | 3.2| Election and Term of Office.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The directors are elected at the annual meeting of shareholders by a majority
of the votes cast. The vote for the election of directors is by show of
hands, unless a ballot is requested by a shareholder present and entitled to
vote at the meeting.

  



  

The term of office of a director starts on the date of the meeting of
shareholders at which he or she is elected or on such other date as the
shareholders determine. Each director remains in office for a term not
exceeding three years or until a successor is elected, unless his or her
mandate otherwise ends before the completion of his or her term. A director
not elected for an expressly stated term ceases to hold office at the close
of the first annual meeting of shareholders following his or her election. A
director whose mandate has expired is eligible for another term.

  



  

All steps taken by a meeting of the directors or by any person acting as a
director, until their successors have been duly elected or appointed, shall,
notwithstanding that it is subsequently discovered that there was some defect
in the election of the directors or of such person acting as a director or
that any one of them was disqualified, be as valid as if the directors or such
other person, as the case may be, had been duly elected and were qualified to
be directors of the Corporation.

  



   | 3.3| Remuneration  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Board determines the remuneration of the directors from time to time, by
resolution. The directors are also entitled to be reimbursed for travel costs
and reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of their duties.

  



   | 3.4| Calling and Place of Meetings.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The chair of the Board, the chief executive officer or the president (if the
chair of the Board is unavailable), or the majority of directors then in
office, may at any time call a meeting of directors, to be held at the time
and place the person or persons calling the meeting determine. The secretary
shall cause notice of a meeting of directors to be given when so directed by
such person or persons.

  



  

Meetings of directors may be held at any place in or outside Canada.

  



   | 3.5| Notice of Meeting.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Notice of the time and place for the holding of any meeting of directors will
be given to each director not less than 48 hours before the time when the
meeting is to be held, provided that meetings of directors may be held at any
time without notice if all the directors have waived notice.

  



  

If a quorum of directors, as defined in Section 3.7 below, is present, a
meeting of directors may be held, without notice, immediately following the
annual meeting of shareholders.

  



  

A notice of a meeting of directors need not specify the purpose of, or the
business to be transacted at, the meeting; it must, however, specify the time
and place of the meeting, and where applicable, any matter to be dealt with at
the meeting that relates to powers the Board may not delegate.

  



  

A notice of meeting must be sent to each director, at his or her last known
civic or electronic address, by any means providing proof of its sending.

  



  

In all cases in which the chair of the Board, the vice-chair of the Board, if
any, the president and chief executive officer or the majority of the
directors in office consider, in their discretion, that it is urgent to call a
meeting of the directors, they may cause a notice of such meeting to be given
by any means which they deem sufficient at least two (2) hours before the
meeting is to be held, and such notice shall be sufficient for such meeting.

     



  

   

- 3 - 

 



    



   | 3.6| Waiver.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

A director may waive notice of a meeting of directors, any irregularity in a
notice of meeting of directors or any other irregularity in the calling or
holding of a meeting of directors. Such waiver must be given in writing and
may be given at any time either before or after the meeting to which it
relates. Waiver of notice of a meeting of directors cures any irregularity in
the notice or in its timeliness, and any failure to give the notice.

  



  

Attendance of a director at a meeting of directors constitutes waiver of
notice of the meeting, except when such director attends a meeting for the
sole purpose of objecting to the holding of the meeting and the transaction of
any business on the grounds that it was not lawfully called.

  



   | 3.7| Quorum.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Unless otherwise provided in a resolution of the Board as provided in the
Act, a majority of the directors then in office constitutes a quorum at any
meeting of directors. A quorum of directors may exercise all the powers of the
directors despite any vacancy among the Board.

  



   | 3.8| Chair and Secretary.

The chair of any meeting of directors is the first mentioned of the following
who is a director and is present at the meeting: (i) the chair of the Board;
(ii) the vice-chair of the Board, if any, and (iii) if no such person is
present at the meeting, the participating director designated to act as chair
by the other directors present at the meeting.

  



  

The secretary will act as secretary at meetings of directors. If a secretary
has not been appointed or the secretary is absent, the chair of the meeting
shall designate a person, who need not be a director, to act as secretary for
the meeting.

  



   | 3.9| Votes to Govern.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Any question at a meeting of directors will be decided by a majority of the
votes cast on the question at the meeting. Each director is entitled to one
vote. In case of an equality of votes, whether the vote is by show of hands or
ballot, the chair of the meeting will not be entitled to a second or casting
vote.

  



  

Voting shall be carried out by a show of hands, or at the request of a
director, by secret ballot. A vote by secret ballot may be requested before
or after a vote by show of hands. If voting is by secret ballot, the secretary
will act as scrutineer and review and tally the ballots.

  



   | 3.10| Dissent.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

A director who is present at a meeting of the Board or a committee of the
Board is deemed to have consented to any resolution passed at the meeting
unless:

  



   | (1)| the  director's dissent has been entered in the minutes; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| the  director sends a written dissent to the secretary of the
meeting before the meeting is  adjourned; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| the  director delivers a written dissent to the chair of the
Board, sends it to the chair  by any means providing proof of the date of
receipt or delivers it to the head office  of the Corporation immediately
after the meeting is adjourned.

A director is not entitled to dissent after voting for or consenting to a
resolution.

   | 3.11| Dissent of an Absent Director.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

A director who was not present at a meeting at which a resolution was passed
is deemed to have consented to the resolution unless the director records his
or her dissent in accordance with the Act within seven (7) days after becoming
aware of the resolution.

  



   | 3.12| Adjournment.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The chair of any meeting of the directors may, with the consent of the
majority of those directors who are present at the meeting, adjourn the
meeting to a fixed time and place. No notice of the time and place for the
continuance of the adjourned meeting need be given to any director in such a
case.

  



  

An adjourned meeting is duly constituted if held in accordance with the terms
of the adjournment and a quorum is present at the adjourned meeting. The
directors who formed the quorum at the original meeting are not required to
form the quorum at the adjourned meeting.

  



   | 3.13| Electronic Meetings.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

If all the directors consent thereto generally or in respect of a particular
meeting, a director may participate in a meeting of directors by means of
equipment enabling all participants to communicate directly with one another.
A director participating in a meeting by such means is deemed to be present
at the meeting. Any consent is effective whether given before or after the
meeting to which it relates and may be given in respect of all meetings of
the directors.

  



   | 3.14| Resolution in lieu of Meeting.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

A resolution in writing, signed by all the directors entitled to vote on that
resolution, has the same force as if it had been passed at a meeting of the
directors. A copy of the resolution must be kept with the minutes of the
meetings of the directors.

  



  

A resolution in writing that is signed electronically by the directors is as
legally valid as if it were signed by written signature.

  



   | 3.15| Record Date.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Board may fix, in conformity with the Act and applicable securities laws,
a date as the record date for the purpose of determining the shareholders
entitled to receive notice of a meeting of shareholders, receive payment of a
dividend, participate in a liquidation or distribution and vote at a meeting
of shareholders or for any other purpose. Only those registered shareholders
on the record date thus fixed are entitled to receive notice of a meeting of
shareholders, receive payment of a dividend, participate in a liquidation or
distribution or vote at a meeting of shareholders or for any other purpose, as
the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of shares recorded in the
securities register of the Corporation after the record date.

Unless otherwise determined by the Board, each committee of directors may
make, amend or repeal rules and procedures to regulate its meetings
including: (i) fixing the quorum, provided it is not less than a majority of
the members of the committee; (ii) procedures for calling meetings; (iii)
requirements for providing notice of meetings; (iv) selecting a chair for a
meeting; and (v) determining whether the chair will have a deciding vote in
the event there is an equality of votes cast on a question.

  



  

Subject to any such rules or procedures established to regulate its meetings,
Sections 3.1 to 3.14 hereof apply to any committee of directors, with such
changes as are necessary.

  



   | 4.3| Cessation of office.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

A director may resign from a committee of the Board at any time. The
resignation of a director becomes effective at the time the director's
written resignation is received by the Corporation, or at the time specified
in the resignation, whichever is later. The reason for the resignation is not
required to be given.

  



  

The Board may, by resolution, replace a member of a committee of the Board.

ARTICLE 5

  

OFFICERS

  



   | 5.1| Appointment.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Board may appoint officers of the Corporation, which may include any of
the following: a chair of the Board, a president, one or more vice-
presidents, a chief executive officer, a chief operating officer, a chief
financial officer, a secretary, and one or more assistants to any of the
appointed officers. The same person may hold more than one position as
officer. None of them need be a director or shareholder of the Corporation,
except for the chair of the Board who must be a director.

  



   | 5.2| Cessation of Office.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

An officer may resign at any time. The resignation of an officer takes effect
on the date the Corporation receives the written notice he or she gives or on
the later date indicated therein.

  



  

The Board or the chief executive officer may remove an officer from office at
any time, with or without cause. Such removal is without prejudice to the
officer's rights, if any, under any contract or laws governing his or her
employment. However, the removal of the president, the chair of the Board,
the chief executive officer, the chief operating officer, or the chief
financial officer regardless of their title, as their appointment, is the
responsibility of the Board.

  



   | 5.3| Vacancy  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Board may fill any vacancy in an office at any time.

   | 5.4| Powers of Officers.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

An officer exercises the powers attached to his or her position. He or she
also exercises all the powers which the Board can delegate to him or her. In
the event an officer is unable to act, the powers of such officer are
exercised by any other person designated by the Board.

  



  

ARTICLE 6

  

PROTECTION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND OTHERS

  



   | 6.1| Indemnity.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

In accordance with the Act, the Corporation shall indemnify (i) any director
or officer of the Corporation and any former director or officer of the
Corporation, (ii) any mandatary of the Corporation, and (iii) any other person
who acts or acted at the Corporation's request as a director or officer of
another group against all costs, charges and expenses reasonably incurred in
the exercise of their functions, including an amount paid to settle an action
or satisfy a judgment, or arising from any investigative or other proceeding
in which the person is involved because of that association with the
Corporation or other entity. The Corporation shall also advance moneys to
such a director, officer or other person for the costs, charges and expenses
of such a proceeding in accordance with the Act.

  



  

The Corporation is authorized to sign agreements in favour of any of the
foregoing persons evidencing the terms of this indemnity. Nothing in this by-
law limits the right of any person entitled to indemnity to claim indemnity
apart from the provisions of this by-law.

  



   | 6.2| Limits on Indemnity.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Corporation may not indemnify or advance moneys to a person described in
Section 6.1 in the event that a court or any other competent authority judges
that the conditions for indemnification set out in the Act are not fulfilled
or determines that such person has committed an intentional or gross fault.

  



   | 6.3| Liability Insurance.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Corporation must purchase and maintain insurance for the benefit of its
directors, officers and other mandataries against any liability they may
incur as such or in their capacity as directors, officers or mandataries of
another group, if they act or acted in that capacity at the Corporation's
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation may, as an alternative
or in addition to purchasing and maintaining an insurance policy, implement
and maintain a valid and irrevocable trust that provides
substantially similar coverage as would a policy of insurance contemplated by
this Section, as may be approved by the Board.

  



  

ARTICLE 7

  

SHAREHOLDERS

  



   | 7.1| General.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Corporation must hold an annual meeting of shareholders; it may hold one
or more special meetings of shareholders as needed. An annual meeting must be
held not later than fifteen (15) months after the last preceding annual
meeting of shareholders.

  



   | 7.2| Calling and Place of Meetings.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Board has the power to call annual and special meetings of shareholders,
to be held on the date and at the time and place it determines; however, such
a meeting of shareholders may be held at a place outside the province of
Quebec if the articles so allow.

  



  

   

- 7 - 

 



    



   | 7.3| Notice of Meeting.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Subject to the _Securities Act_ (Quebec) and applicable securities laws, the
notice of a meeting of shareholders must be sent to each shareholder entitled
to vote at the meeting and to each director. The time period to provide notice
of a meeting of shareholders is not less than 21 days and not more than 60
days before the meeting.

  



  

The notice of meeting is sent to those shareholders entered in the securities
register of the Corporation on the record date.

  



  

A certificate from the secretary or any other duly authorized officer of the
Corporation in office at the time of the preparation of such certificate, or
any officer, transfer agent, or share transfer registrar of the Corporation,
constitutes proof of the sending of the notice of meeting and shall be
binding upon each person entitled to receive the notice of meeting.

  



  

Irregularities in the notice of meeting or in the sending thereof do not
affect the validity of the meeting. Similarly, the unintentional failure to
send a notice of meeting to a person entitled to it, or the failure to receive
it by a person entitled to the notice, does not invalidate the resolutions
passed at the meeting. In addition, the unintentional failure to include a
matter to be discussed at the meeting in the notice does not prevent the
meeting from discussing such business, unless the interests of a
shareholder or director are or could be affected thereby.

  



   | 7.4| Waiver.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

A shareholder or director may waive notice of a meeting of shareholders. Such
waiver may be given in any manner and at any time either before or after the
meeting to which it relates. Waiver of notice of a meeting of shareholders
cures any irregularity in the notice or in its timeliness, and any failure to
give the notice.

  



  

Attendance by a shareholder or director at a meeting of shareholders
constitutes waiver of notice of the meeting, except when such person attends
the meeting for the sole purpose of objecting to the holding of the meeting on
the grounds that it was not lawfully called or held.

  



   | 7.5| Persons Entitled to be Present.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The only persons entitled to be present at a meeting of shareholders are
those persons entitled to vote at the meeting, the directors, the auditor, if
any and if called upon to attend, and others who, although not entitled to
vote, are entitled or required under any provision of the Act, the articles,
or the by-laws to be present at the meeting. Any other person may be admitted
with the consent of the chair of the meeting or, if any of the persons
present who are entitled to vote at the meeting request a vote on such
matter, with the consent of such persons.

  



  

If a director or a shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders
gives written notice not less than 10 days before the meeting to the auditor
or a former auditor of the Corporation, the auditor or former auditor attends
the meeting at the Corporation's expense and answers any question relating to
its duties as auditor.

  



   | 7.6| Quorum.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

A quorum of shareholders is present at a meeting of shareholders if, at the
opening of the meeting, two persons representing at least twenty-five per
cent (25%) of the shares that carry the right to vote at the meeting are
present in person or represented by proxy.

  



  

The actions taken by holders of the majority of shares so represented, which
entitle their holders to vote, are considered as actions taken by all
shareholders, unless the vote or consent of holders of a greater number of
shares is required or prescribed by the applicable legislation, the articles
or the by-laws.

     



  

   

- 8 - 

 



    



   | 7.7| Proxies.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

A proxy must comply with the applicable requirements of the Act and other
applicable law and must be in such form as the Board may approve from time to
time or such other form as may be acceptable to the chair of the meeting at
which it is to be used.

  



  

A proxy will be acted on only if it is deposited with the Corporation or its
agent prior to the time specified in the notice calling the meeting at which
the proxy is to be used, or, if it is deposited with the secretary, the
scrutineer for the meeting or the chair of the meeting prior to the time of
voting. Unless otherwise indicated, a proxy may be revoked at any time and
lapses one year after the date it is given.

  



  

The Board may, by resolution, fix the latest date and time for delivery of
proxies to the Corporation or to its agent and indicate such date and time in
the notice of meeting, which date and time, as provided above, shall not be
more than 48 hours before the date of the meeting or any adjournment thereof.

  



   | 7.8| Chair, Secretary and Scrutineers.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The chair of any meeting of shareholders is the first mentioned of the
following persons who is present at the meeting: (i) the chair of the Board;
(ii) the vice-chair of the Board, if any; (iii) the president, (iv) the chief
executive officer and (v) any other person that may be designated by the
Board from time to time.

  



  

The secretary will act as secretary at meetings of shareholders. If a
secretary has not been appointed or the secretary is absent, the chair of the
meeting shall designate a person, who need not be a shareholder, to act as
secretary of the meeting.

  



  

The chair of the meeting may appoint one or more persons, who need not be
shareholders, to act as scrutineers at any meeting of shareholders and, in
that capacity, to report to the chair such information as to attendance,
representation, voting and other matters at such meeting as the chair of the
meeting directs.

  



   | 7.9| Procedure.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The chair of a meeting of shareholders will conduct the meeting and determine
the procedure to be followed at the meeting. The chair's decision on all
matters or things, including the validity or invalidity of a form of proxy or
other instrument appointing a proxy, will be conclusive and binding upon the
meeting of shareholders.

  



   | 7.10| Manner of Voting.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Subject to the Act, any question at a meeting of shareholders will be decided
by a show of hands, unless a ballot on the question is required or demanded.
Subject to the Act, the chair of the meeting may require, or any shareholder
who is present and entitled to vote may demand, a ballot on any question at a
meeting of shareholders. The requirement or demand for a ballot may be made
either before or after any vote on the question by a show of hands. A ballot
will be taken in the manner the chair of the meeting directs. A requirement
or demand for a ballot may be withdrawn at any time prior to the taking of the
ballot. The result of such ballot will determine the decision of the
shareholders upon the question.

  



  

In the case of a vote by a show of hands, each person present who is entitled
to vote has one vote. If a ballot is taken, each person present who is
entitled to vote has the number of votes that are attached to the shares which
such person is entitled to vote at the meeting.

  



  

A proxyholder has the same rights as the shareholder represented to vote at
the meeting. A proxyholder who has conflicting instructions from more than
one shareholder may not, however, vote by show of hands.

     



  

   

- 9 - 

 



    



   | 7.11| Electronic Meetings.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Meetings of shareholders may be held solely by means of equipment enabling
all participants to communicate directly with one another. Any person
entitled to attend a meeting of shareholders who participates by such means is
deemed for purposes of the Act to be present at the meeting. The Board may
establish procedures regarding the holding of meetings of shareholders by such
means.

  



  

Any shareholder participating in a meeting of shareholders by means of
equipment enabling all participants to communicate directly with one another
may vote by any means enabling votes to be cast in a way that allows them to
be verified afterwards, whether the vote is by a functional equivalent of a
show of hands or by ballot, and protects the secrecy of the vote when a ballot
has been requested.

  



   | 7.12| Votes to Govern.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Any question at a meeting of shareholders will be decided by a majority of
the votes cast on the question unless the Act, the articles, the by-laws,
applicable securities laws or stock exchange rules require otherwise. In case
of an equality of votes, whether the vote is by a show of hands or by a
ballot, the chair of the meeting is not entitled to a second or casting vote.

  



  

The Corporation shall keep at its head office the ballots cast and the
proxies presented at a meeting of shareholders for at least three months
after the meeting.

  



   | 7.13| Adjournment.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The chair of a meeting of shareholders may, with the consent of the persons
present who are entitled to vote at the meeting, adjourn the meeting to a
fixed time and place, subject to such conditions as such persons may decide
and to the relevant provisions of the Act for the giving of notice.

  



  

An adjourned meeting is duly constituted if held in accordance with the terms
of the adjournment and a quorum is present at the adjourned meeting. Any
business which might have been considered and transacted at the original
meeting of shareholders may be considered and transacted at the adjourned
meeting.

  



   | 7.14| Resolution in lieu of Meeting.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

A resolution in writing, signed by all the shareholders entitled to vote on
that resolution, is as valid as if it had been passed at a meeting of
shareholders. The resolution must be kept with the minutes of the meetings of
shareholders.

   | 8.3| Direct Registration.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Subject to the Act, a registered securityholder may have his or her holdings
of securities of the Corporation evidenced by an electronic, book-based,
direct registration service or other non-certificated entry or position on the
register of securityholders to be kept by the Corporation in place of a
physical security certificate pursuant to a registration system that may be
adopted by the Corporation, in conjunction with its transfer agent (if any).
This by-law shall be read such that a registered holder of securities of
the Corporation pursuant to any such electronic, book-based, direct
registration service or other non-certificated entry or position shall be
entitled to all of the same benefits, rights, entitlements and shall incur the
same duties and obligations as a registered holder of securities evidenced by
a physical security certificate. The Corporation and its transfer agent may
adopt such policies and procedures and require such documents and evidence as
they may determine necessary or desirable in order to facilitate the adoption
and maintenance of a security registration system by electronic, book-based,
direct registration system or other non-certificated means.

  



  

ARTICLE 9

  

DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS

  



   | 9.1| Declaration of dividends  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Unless otherwise provided in the articles, the Board may declare and the
Corporation may pay a dividend either in money or property or by issuing
fully paid shares or options or rights to acquire fully paid shares of the
Corporation.

  



  

The Corporation may not declare and pay a dividend, except by issuing shares
or options or rights to acquire shares, if there are reasonable grounds for
believing that the Corporation is, or would after the payment be, unable to
pay its liabilities as they become due.

  



  

The Corporation may deduct from the dividends payable to a shareholder any
amount due to the Corporation by the shareholder, on account of calls for
payment or otherwise.

  



   | 9.2| Record Date  
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Board may fix, in advance, in accordance with the articles and applicable
securities laws, a record date for the determination of the shareholders
entitled to receive dividends.

  



   | 9.3| Payments of Dividends and Other Distributions.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Any dividend or other distribution payable in cash to shareholders may be
paid by cheque, by electronic means, or by any other method the Board
determines. The payment will be made to or to the order of each registered
holder of shares in respect of which the payment is to be made. Cheques will
be sent to the registered holder's Recorded Address, unless the holder
otherwise directs. In the case of joint holders, the payment will be made to
the order of all such joint holders and, if applicable, sent to them at their
Recorded Address, unless such joint holders otherwise direct.

  



  

The sending of the cheque, the sending of the payment by electronic means, or
the sending of the payment by any other method determined by the Board, in an
amount equal to the dividend or other distribution to be paid, less any tax
that the Corporation is required to withhold, will satisfy and discharge the
liability for the payment, unless payment is not made upon presentation.

shareholder is involved in making the nomination proposal.

  



  

The Corporation may also require any Proposed Nominee to furnish such other

questionnaire, as it may reasonably require to determine whether the nominee
would be considered "independent" as a director or as a member of the audit
committee of the directors under the various rules and standards applicable to
the Corporation in the same manner as such rules and standards are applicable
to the Corporation's other directors.

  



  

In addition to the provisions of this Article 10, a Nominating Shareholder
and any Proposed Nominee shall also comply with all of the applicable
requirements of the Act, applicable securities laws and applicable stock
exchange rules regarding the matters set forth herein.

considered timely and in proper form, a Nominating Shareholder's notice shall
be promptly updated and supplemented if necessary, so that the information
provided or required to be provided in such notice shall be true and correct
as of the record date for the meeting.

  



   | 10.7| Power of the Chair.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

No person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation
unless nominated in accordance with the provisions of the by-laws; provided,
however, that nothing in the by-laws shall be deemed to preclude discussion by
a shareholder (as distinct from the nomination of directors) at a meeting of
shareholders of any matter in respect of which it would have been entitled to
submit a proposal pursuant to the provisions of the Act. The chair of the
meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination was
made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article 10 and, if
any proposed nomination is not in compliance with this Article 10, to declare
that such defective nomination shall be disregarded.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 10, notice given to the
secretary pursuant to this Article 10 may only be given by personal delivery,
facsimile transmission or by email (at such email address as stipulated from
time to time by the secretary for purposes of this notice), and shall be
deemed to have been given and made only at the time it is served by personal
delivery, email (at the aforesaid address) or sent by facsimile transmission
(provided that receipt of the confirmation of such transmission has
been received) to the secretary, at the address of the principal executive
offices of the Corporation, provided that if such delivery or electronic
communication is made on a day which is not a business day or later than 5:00

ARTICLE 11

  

FORUM SELECTION

  



  

Unless the Corporation approves or consents in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, the courts of the Province of Quebec and the appellate
courts therefrom shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole
and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on
behalf of the Corporation; (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim for
breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of
the Corporation to the Corporation; (iii) any action or proceeding asserting
a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Act or the articles or the
by-laws of the Corporation (as either may be amended from time to time); or
(iv) any action or proceeding asserting a claim otherwise related to the
affairs of the Corporation. If any action or proceeding the subject matter of
which is within the scope of the preceding sentences is filed in a court (a
"Non-Designated Court") other than a court located within the Province of
Quebec (a "Foreign Action") in the name of any securityholder, such
securityholder shall be deemed to have consented to (i) the personal
jurisdiction of the courts located within the Province of Quebec in connection
with any action or proceeding brought in any such Non-Designated Court to
enforce the preceding sentences and (ii) having service of process made upon
such securityholder in any such action or proceeding by service upon such
securityholder's counsel in the Foreign Action as agent for such
securityholder. This Article 11 shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a
duty or liability created by the U.S. Securities Act or the Exchange Act or
any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.
Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of
the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution
of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the U.S.
Securities Act. Any person or entity holding, owning or otherwise acquiring
any interest in any security of the Corporation shall be deemed to have
notice of and to have consented to the provisions of this Article 11.

   | 12.2| Notice to Joint Holders.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Subject to applicable securities laws, if two or more persons are registered
as joint holders of any shares, any notice or other document relating to such
shares may be addressed to all such joint holders but notice addressed to one
of them constitutes sufficient notice and delivery to all of them.

  



   | 12.3| Electronic Documents.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

A requirement under this by-law that a notice, document or other information
be provided in writing may be satisfied by providing an electronic document
and a requirement under this by-law for a signature or that a document be
executed, in relation to an electronic document, may be satisfied, in each
case, if the requirements in the Act, applicable securities laws or any other
applicable law in respect thereof are met.

  



   | 12.4| Persons Entitled by Operation of Law.  
---|---|--- 
  



  

Every person who becomes entitled to any share by operation of law, transfer,
death of a shareholder or any other means, is bound by every notice in
respect of such share that has been given to the shareholder from whom the
person derives title to such share before such person's name and address is
entered on the securities register (whether the notice was given before or
after the happening of the event on which such person became so entitled) and
before such person furnished the Corporation with the proof of authority or
evidence of such person's entitlement. Computation of Time Periods.

  



  

Except if otherwise provided in the Act, in computing the date when notice of
any event must be given if a specified number of days is required, (i) the
date of giving the notice is excluded and the date of the event is included,
(ii) non-juridical days within the meaning of the _Code of Civil Procedure_
are counted; but when the last day is a non-juridical day, the time limit
is extended to the next following juridical day and (iii) Saturday is
considered a non-juridical day.

  



  

This by-law was made by resolution of the Board and ratified by ordinary
resolution of the shareholders on [ ], 2020.
