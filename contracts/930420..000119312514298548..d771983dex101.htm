2.1 _Purchase and Sale of Shares_. Upon the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the Seller hereby sells to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser
hereby purchases from the Seller, the Shares free and clear of all
Encumbrances.

2.2 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the Shares is
$$119,000,000 (the " _Purchase Price_ "), subject to adjustment pursuant to
_Section 2.3_ below.

 



- 13 \- 2.3 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Section 2.3(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth Sellers good
faith estimate of Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital_
").

(i) If the (A) Estimated Net Working Capital is less than (B) the
Baseline Net Working Capital, the Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall
be reduced by such difference; or

(ii) If the (A) Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than (B) the
Baseline Net Working Capital, the Purchase Price payable at the Closing shall
be increased by such difference.

 

(b) Within forty-five (45) Business Days after the Closing, the Purchaser
shall deliver to the Seller a calculation of Net Working Capital (the "
_Closing Schedule_ "). Prior to the date on which the Purchaser delivers to
the Seller the calculation described in the previous sentence (the " _Delivery
Date_ "), the Seller shall make its accounting personnel reasonably available
to the Purchaser to facilitate the Purchasers calculation of Net Working
Capital.

(c) In the event (A) the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than (B)
the Net Working Capital, the Seller shall be required to refund, as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, to the Purchaser the amount of such
difference. In the event (A) the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than
(B) the Net Working Capital, the Purchaser shall be required to pay, as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, to the Seller the amount of such difference.
Any amounts owed by the Seller to the Purchaser or by the Purchaser to the

with _Section 2.3(d)_. The adjustment to the Purchase Price provided for in

Adjustment_."

(d) The Seller shall have thirty (30) Business Days from the Delivery Date to
deliver a written notice of disagreement to the Purchaser regarding the
Purchase Price Adjustment (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ "). The sole
permissible grounds for objection shall be that Net Working Capital or the
Purchase Price Adjustment was not calculated in accordance with the definition
thereof. During such period, the Purchaser shall make the books and accounting
records relating to the Business (including work papers) and appropriate
accounting personnel reasonably available to the Seller for the purpose of
verifying Net Working Capital. Any such Notice of Disagreement shall specify
in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted and any
contested amounts and shall include a schedule in the form of _Section
2.3(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule setting forth the Sellers determination of
Net Working Capital and the Purchase Price Adjustment. If no Notice of
Disagreement is delivered within such thirty (30) Business Day period, the Net
Working Capital and Purchase Price Adjustment set forth in the Closing
Schedule shall become final and binding upon the Parties. If a Notice of
Disagreement is delivered, any amounts not disputed therein shall become
final and binding upon the Parties. Following delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, the Parties shall attempt to resolve any differences which they
may have with respect to any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement.
If the Parties fail to reach a written agreement with respect to all such
matters within forty (40) Business Days of the Notice of Disagreement, then
all such matters as specified 

 



- 14 \-  in the Notice of Disagreement as to which such written agreement has not
been reached (the " _Disputed Matters_ ") shall be submitted to and reviewed
by an arbitrator (the " _Arbitrator_ "), who shall be an audit partner of
Grant Thornton LLP or at such other nationally recognized accounting firm as
the Seller and the Purchaser shall mutually agree upon in writing in the event
Grant Thornton LLP is unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity or if it
is engaged by either Party after the date of this Agreement. The Arbitrator
shall act promptly to resolve all Disputed Matters, his or her decision shall
be within the ranges submitted by the Parties in the Disputed Matters (which
shall not be outside the ranges defined by the Closing Schedule and the Notice
of Disagreement), his or her decision shall not address matters other than the
Disputed Matters, his or her decision shall be based solely on presentations
by the Purchaser and the Seller, and shall not involve the Arbitrators
independent review and his or her decision with respect to all Disputed
Matters shall be final and binding upon the Parties. The fees and expenses of
the Arbitrator incurred in resolving the Disputed Matters shall be borne: (i)
by the Seller in that proportion that the amount the Seller is not awarded
bears to the aggregate amount contested by the Seller and (ii) by the
Purchaser in that proportion that the amount the Seller is awarded bears to
the aggregate amount contested by the Seller; and the Arbitrator shall make an
allocation of its fees and expenses consistent with the foregoing. For
example, if the Seller submits a Disputed Matter to the Arbitrator with a
value of $100,000 and the Arbitrator awards $75,000 to the Seller, the Seller
shall bear 25% of the Arbitrators fees and expenses and the Purchaser shall
bear 75% of the Arbitrators fees and expenses. If a Notice of Disagreement
is delivered, the Purchase Price Adjustment, including any adjustment required
pursuant to this _Section 2.3(d)_, shall be paid by the Purchaser or the
Seller, respectively, by wire transfer to a bank account designated by the
Seller or the Purchaser, as appropriate, within five (5) Business Days of
final determination (whether the Notice of Disagreement is resolved by the
Parties mutual resolution or by the Arbitrator) thereof in
immediately available United States Dollars. For purposes of this Agreement,
" _Final Net Working Capital_ " means Net Working Capital as finally
determined pursuant to this Section.

representatives or beneficiaries thereof, any rights or remedies, including
any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period or to

not (i) directly or indirectly solicit or interfere with, or endeavor to
entice away from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries any of
their respective employees or individual contractors; or (ii) directly or
indirectly employ or engage as a contractor any person who, at any time during
the six (6) month period preceding the Closing was, or during the Seller

engagement occurred at least twelve (12) months before the date of soliciting
or hiring. The Purchaser and the Company agrees that through the second (2nd)
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Purchaser Nonsolicitation Period_ "),

(c) The Seller agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not
to, enforce any non-competition, non-solicitation, non-hire, confidentiality
or similar provisions contained in any Contract between the Seller or any of
its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) and any Person
who is an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (i) against such
employee, and that such employee shall not have any Liability under or with
respect to any such Contract, in each case, with respect to any period during
which such Person was an employee of Purchaser, the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their other Affiliates and (ii) against Purchaser, the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any of their other Affiliates or any
directors, officers, employees, agents or representatives of any of the

confidentiality provisions to prevent disclosures to third Persons of
information not related to the direct operations of the Business and (ii)
this sentence shall not affect the confidentiality and non-solicitation
provisions provided elsewhere in the Purchase Agreement or the Transition

Subsidiaries or any of their other Affiliates.

(d) If any court of competent jurisdiction shall at any time deem the term of
any particular restrictive covenant contained in this _Section 5.5_ too
lengthy, the geographic area covered too extensive or the scope too broad, the
other provisions of this _Section 5.5_ shall nevertheless stand, the term
shall be deemed to be the longest period permissible by Law under the
circumstances, the geographic area covered shall be deemed to comprise the
largest territory permissible by Law under the circumstances and the scope
shall be as broad as permissible by Law under the circumstances. The court in
each case shall reduce the term, geographic area and or scope covered to
permissible duration, size or breadth.

bargain set forth in this Agreement as specifically negotiated by the Parties

breach of the provisions of this _Section 5.5_ by the Seller would result in
a significant loss of goodwill by the Purchaser and the Company and its
Subsidiaries, (iv) the Purchase Price is sufficient consideration to make the
Sellers covenants and agreements set forth herein enforceable, (v) the length
of time, scope and geographic coverage of the covenants set forth in this

Transition Services Agreement, the Transition License or  _Section 5.6_,
immediately following the Closing, the Company and the Purchaser shall not use
the name "Kforce" or any related logo on any medium, including signs, boxes,

its Subsidiaries and each of their respective present and former managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the

whatsoever other than Liabilities resulting from fraud or intentional
misconduct of the Releasees (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) and
(b) agrees that no Releasing Party will bring or voluntarily participate in or

5.11 _Insurance Matters_.

 

(a) With respect to any events or circumstances pertaining to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, assets or operations
that relate to the period prior to the Closing and are eligible for coverage
under any third party insurance policy held or controlled by Seller or any of

Occurrence Policy_ "), Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide the Company and its Subsidiaries with access to such policies and
shall reasonably cooperate with the Company and its Subsidiaries, and use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Company and its Subsidiaries,
in submitting and pursuing claims with respect to such events or
circumstances, including, but not limited to, assigning to the Company or its
Subsidiaries all rights under such policies to submit, pursue and obtain

- 47 \-  retentions and any collateral requirements with respect to any events or
circumstances for which they make a claim under any Pre-Closing Occurrence
Policy. In the event that Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the

any Pre-Closing Occurrence Policy for which an aggregate deductible is
payable, the aggregate amount of the deductible paid shall be borne by Seller
and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on
the other hand, in the same proportion which the aggregate amount of such bona
fide claims made by Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and

amount of such bona fide claims made under the applicable Pre-Closing
Occurrence Policy, and any party who has borne more than such proportionate
share of the deductible shall be entitled to receive from the other party an
appropriate amount so that each of Seller and its Affiliates, on the one hand,
and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, have borne their
proportionate share of the aggregate deductible. In the event that Seller and
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, have bona fide claims under any Pre-Closing Occurrence Policy
which in the aggregate exceed the maximum coverage available under such Pre-
Closing Occurrence Policy, the amount of insurance proceeds up to such maximum
coverage shall be allocated between Seller and its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in the same
proportion which the aggregate amount of such bona fide claims by Seller and
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, bears to aggregate amount of all such bona fide claims made by
Seller and its Affiliates and the Company and its Subsidiaries, and any party
who has received more than such proportionate share of the insurance proceeds
up to such maximum coverage shall be entitled to receive from the other party
an appropriate amount so that each of Seller and its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, have received
their proportionate share of the insurance proceeds up to such maximum
coverage. Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, amend,
modify, waive, terminate or cancel any Pre-Closing Occurrence Policy or any
rights thereunder in a manner that adversely affects the rights of the Company
and its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist the Company and its Subsidiaries, in obtaining "prior acts" insurance
policy coverage for directors and officer liability (executive liability and
entity securities liability), excess directors and officers liability,
directors and officers side ADIC, fiduciary liability, employment practices
liability and errors and omissions liability with respect to any events or
circumstances pertaining to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective businesses, assets or operations that relate to the period
prior to the Closing (collectively, the " _Prior Acts Coverage_ ").

 

5.12 _Contract Matters_. To the extent that Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) are party to any Contract with
any customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise used in or
related to the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and such
Contract is not assigned to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries prior
to or at the Closing, Seller shall and shall cause its Affiliates to (a) upon
the written request of the Purchaser, cooperate with the Purchaser in
connection with, and use reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as
practicable, (i) obtain any necessary consent to the assignment of such
Contract to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and assign such Contract
(upon receipt of any

 



- 48 \-  required consent) to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and/or (ii)
effect the negotiation and entry into one or more new Contracts that
supersedes and replaces the Contract to which Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) are party with a comparable
Contract to which neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates is a party and (b)
until any such assignment and/or replacement is in effect with respect to any
such Contract, act as the Companys and its Subsidiaries agent in order to
obtain for then the benefits thereunder and cooperate, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law and such Contract, with the Company and its Subsidiaries in
any other reasonable arrangement designed to provide such benefits to the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

period set forth above, the applicable representations, warranties covenants,
agreements and indemnification obligations shall continue with respect to such
claim until the final resolution and satisfaction of such claim in accordance
with the provisions of this _Article VII_ , and the Indemnifying Party shall
indemnify the Indemnified Party for all Losses incurred in respect of such
claim (subject to any applicable limitations herein), regardless of when
the Losses related to such claim are incurred.

7.2 _Indemnification of Purchaser_.

 



- 51 \- (a) Subject to _Sections 7.4_ and _7.5_ of this Agreement, the Seller shall
indemnify Purchaser, its Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents and Representatives (each, a " _Purchaser Indemnified
Party_ ") against, and hold each Purchaser Indemnified Party harmless from
and against, any and all Losses suffered or incurred by such Purchaser
Indemnified Party, arising from, relating to or otherwise in connection with
the following (collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnifiable Losses_ "):

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller contained in
this Agreement (other than Section 3.17) or in any other agreement or
instrument executed and delivered by the Seller pursuant to this Agreement
(excluding the Transition Services Agreement);

 

(ii) any breach or failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the Seller

Indemnifiable Losses under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ shall in no event exceed
$8,925,000 (the " _Cap_ ").

Indemnifiable Losses shall be required, including the first $100,000 (subject
to any applicable limitations herein, including clause (ii) of this sentence),
and (ii) the aggregate amount of such Purchaser Indemnifiable Losses exceeds
$1,190,000 (the " _Indemnification Deductible_ ") and then only to the extent

examples: (i) if the Purchaser Indemnifiable Losses with respect to one
matter were to equal $90,000 and with respect to a separate distinct matter
were to equal $1,120,000, then no payment would be required under this
Agreement and (ii) if the Purchaser Indemnifiable Losses with respect to one
matter were to equal $110,000 and with respect to a separate distinct matter
were to equal $1,120,000, then the required payment under this Agreement would
be $40,000.

limitations set forth in _Sections 7.2(b)_ and _7.2(c)_ shall not apply to
Purchaser Indemnifiable Losses arising from, relating to or otherwise in
connection with any breach of a Fundamental Representation and (ii) no

to or otherwise in connection with any breach of any Fundamental
Representation shall be considered in determining whether the Indemnification

each Seller Indemnified Party harmless from any and all Losses suffered or
incurred by any such Seller Indemnified Party arising from, relating to or
otherwise in connection with (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnifiable
Losses_ "):

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Purchaser contained
in this Agreement or in any other agreement or instrument executed and

Threshold, in which case payment for all such Purchase Indemnifiable Losses
shall be required, including the first $100,000 (subject to any applicable
limitations herein, including clause (ii) of this sentence), and (ii) the

7.4 _Indemnification Claims_.

 

(a) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under _Section 7.2_ or _7.3_ in respect of, arising out of or
involving a Third Party

 



- 53 \-  Claim, such Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party in writing
of the Third Party Claim within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt by
such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim; _provided,
however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided under _Section 7.2_ or _7.3_ , except to the extent
(and only to the extent) the Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced
as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver
to the Indemnifying Party, within ten (10) Business Days after the Indemnified
Partys receipt thereof, copies of all written notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided under _Section
7.2_ or  _7.3_ , except to the extent (and only to the extent) the
Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.
The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense, and at its option
shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof by appointing a nationally
recognized and reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense, provided that
the Indemnifying Party first enters into a written agreement satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party pursuant to which the Indemnifying Party is
unconditionally obligated to pay any Losses which may arise with respect
to such Third Party Claim (subject to any applicable limitations herein).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to
control the defense of a Third Party Claim (and the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to maintain or assume control of the defense of such Third Party
Claim) if (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or involves any criminal
proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii) the Third
Party Claim involves a customer, supplier or other material business
relationship of an Indemnified Party; (iii) the Third Party Claim seeks an
injunction or other equitable relief against an Indemnified Party; (iv) the
Indemnified Party believes that the Losses relating to the claim could
reasonably be expected to exceed the maximum amount that such Indemnified
Party would then be entitled to recover under this _Article VII_ or; (v) the
Third Party Claim is a Tax Proceeding the defense of which cannot
be conducted separately from the defense of any audit, claim or other
proceeding involving Taxes that are not Seller Taxes. If the Indemnifying
Party has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with the
terms hereof, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose,
and the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the
Indemnified Party other than (i) any fees and expenses of such separate
counsel that are incurred prior to the date the Indemnifying Party assumes
control of such defense or in the event Indemnifying Party does not actively
and diligently defend the Third Party Claim following assumption and (ii) any
fees and expenses of such separate counsel if the Indemnified Party reasonably
shall have concluded (upon advice of its counsel) that there may be one or
more legal defenses available to such Indemnified Party that are not available
to the Indemnifying Party or that the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party may have different, conflicting, or adverse legal positions or interests
with respect to such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle,
compromise, consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to or offer to
settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any
Third Party Claim on a basis which (i) would result in injunctive or other
equitable relief being imposed against any Indemnified Party, or a finding or
admission of any violation of Law being made by any Indemnified Party or (ii)
does not expressly and unconditionally release all Indemnified Parties from
all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim, or
(iii) in the case of a Tax Proceeding, could result in a Purchaser Indemnified
Party incurring Taxes that are not Seller Taxes.

  



- 54 \- (b) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement other than in respect of, arising out of or
involving a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall deliver written
notice of such claim pursuant to _Section 9.3_ below with reasonable
promptness to the Indemnifying Party within the survival period (if there is
an applicable survival period pursuant to _Section 7.1_ above); _provided,
however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided under  _Section 7.2_ or _7.3_ , except to the
extent (and only to the extent) the Indemnifying Party has been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure. If the Indemnifying Party does not
notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) Business Days following its
receipt of such notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to
the Indemnified Party, such claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such
notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party
under _Section 7.2_ or _7.3_ and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount
of the Losses stated in such notice to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in
the case of any notice in which the Losses (or any portion thereof) are
estimated, on such later date when the amount of such Losses (or such portion
thereof) becomes finally determined.

7.5 _No Double Recovery; Use of Insurance_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of this Agreement for any
amount to the extent (and only to the extent) such Indemnified Party has
previously been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount by an unaffiliated
third party under any other provision of this Agreement or otherwise. The
amount of any indemnification payable under this Agreement will be net of any
insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Party under any third party
policies of insurance covering the Loss giving rise to the claim, net of any
costs, expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys),
deductibles or retentions incurred in connection with or as a result of
collecting such proceeds. The Indemnified Party will use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect any such third party insurance and will account
to the Indemnifying Party therefor, but shall in no event be required to
engage counsel or file suit against any third party insurer. If, at any time
subsequent to the Indemnified Party receiving an indemnity payment for a claim
under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party receives payment in respect of
the Loss underlying such claim through recovery, settlement or otherwise under
or pursuant to any third party insurance coverage, or pursuant to any claim,
recovery, settlement or payment by or against a third party, the amount of
such payment, less any costs, expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses
of attorneys), deductibles or retentions incurred in connection with or as a
result of collecting such payment, up to the amount of the indemnity payment
previously received from the Indemnifying Party, will promptly be repaid by
the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party. Nothing under this _Section
7.5_ shall limit, delay or otherwise affect the rights of any Indemnified
Party pursuant to this _Article VII_.

7.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for (a) the Parties rights to seek specific
performance pursuant to, and only to the extent set forth in, _Section 9.9_,
(b) the Parties obligations under _Article II_ and (c) the Parties rights
and remedies under the Transition Services Agreement; following the Closing,
the remedies provided in this _Article VII_ , shall be the sole and exclusive

 



- 55 \-  remedies available to the Parties with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in the case of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified
Parties, as applicable, shall have all remedies available under this Agreement
or otherwise without giving effect to any of the limitations
contained herein.

7.7 _Effect of Investigation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained herein, and any Persons right to indemnification or
other remedies with respect thereto, shall not be affected or deemed waived by
reason of (a) any investigation made by or on behalf of such Person or any of
its Affiliates or the directors, officers, employees, consultants, financial
advisors, counsel, accountants and other agents of such Person or any of its
Affiliates or the fact that such Person or any of its Affiliates or
the directors, officers, employees, consultants, financial advisors, counsel,
accountants and other agents of such Person or any of its Affiliates knew or
should have known at any time that any such representation or warranty is, was
or might be inaccurate, or that any such covenant or agreement was, or may
have been breached, in each case, at any time, whether before or after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, or (b) such Persons
waiver of any condition to the Closing or participation in the Closing.

7.8 _Materiality Qualifiers_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, for purposes of determining (a) whether a breach of a
representation or warranty exists for purposes of this Agreement, (b) the
amount of Losses arising from such a breach for which the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement and (c) whether the Per Claim Threshold
or the Indemnification Deductible has been exceeded, each representation and
warranty contained in this Agreement shall be read without giving effect to
any qualification that is based on materiality, including the words
"material", "Material Adverse Change", "material adverse effect", "in any
material respect" and other uses of the word "material" or words of similar
meaning (and shall be treated as if such words were deleted from such
representation or warranty).

 

7.9 _Payment_. If any amount owed under this _Article VII_ is not paid within
ten (10) Business Days of a final settlement among the Indemnifying Parties
and the Indemnified Parties or upon a final adjudication determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction that an indemnification obligation is owing by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party, such amount shall bear interest
at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, or, if less, the maximum rate
permitted by applicable Law, and the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the
Indemnified Party for any and all costs or expenses of any nature or
kind whatsoever (including reasonable legal fees) incurred in seeking to
collect such amount, and no limitation in this _Article VII_ shall apply to
any such interest or reimbursement.

 

7.10 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Except as otherwise required
by applicable Law, the Parties shall treat any indemnification payment made
hereunder as an adjustment to the Purchase Price when and as paid unless a
final "determination" (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code and any
corresponding or similar applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law) (which shall include, without limitation, the execution of an IRS Form
870-AD or successor form) (a " _Tax Determination_ ") with respect to the
Purchaser and the Seller causes such payment not to be treated as an
adjustment to or refund of the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

 



- 56 \- _ARTICLE VIII_

 

TAX MATTERS

The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as
between the Purchaser and the Seller for certain Tax matters:

8.1 _Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date_.

(a) At the Sellers expense the Seller shall (i) cause the Company and
its Subsidiary to be timely and properly included in any consolidated,
unitary or combined Tax Return of the Seller that will include the operations
of the Company and its Subsidiary for any Tax period (or portion thereof)
ending on or prior to the Closing Date with an initial due date after the
Closing Date (each, a " _Seller Consolidated Return_ ") and (ii) prepare, or
cause to be prepared, at the Sellers expense, all stand-alone Income Tax
Returns for the Company for any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date with an initial due date after the Closing Date (each, a " _Pre-Closing
Return_ "). The Seller shall timely pay to the relevant Taxing Governmental
Entity any Taxes due with respect to any Seller Consolidated Return. All Pre-
Closing Returns and all Seller Consolidated Returns (with respect to the
Company) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice of the
Company and the Seller in preparing similar Tax Returns, except to the extent
otherwise required by applicable Law; _provided_ that no Seller Consolidated
Return shall reflect any election to write down the Sellers basis in the
Companys assets.

 

(b) The Seller will provide a copy of each Pre-Closing Return to the Purchaser
at least thirty (30) days prior to the filing deadline for such Pre-Closing
Return for the Purchasers review and reasonable comment; _provided_ that if
the Seller fails to timely provide any Pre-Closing Return to the Purchaser as
required by this Section 8.1(b), the Purchaser may prepared and file such
Pre-Closing Return at the Sellers expense. The Purchaser shall provide the
Seller with any comments on all Pre-Closing Returns within fifteen (15) days
of the Purchasers receipt of the same; provided, that if no comments are
received by the Seller from the Purchaser within this timeframe, the Purchaser
agrees that the Seller may assume that the Purchaser has no comments and will
provide a copy suitable for filing and, not later than five (5) days prior to
the due date for payment of Taxes with respect to such Pre-Closing Returns,
the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser the amount of any Seller Taxes shown by
any Pre-Closing Return to be due. If the Purchaser does provide comments on
any Pre-Closing Return delivered to it pursuant to this Section 8.1(b), the
Purchaser and the Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputes
regarding such Pre-Closing Return. If the Purchaser and the Seller are unable
to resolve any such dispute at least ten (10) days before the due date for
filing of such Pre-Closing Return, such dispute shall be resolved by the
Arbitrator in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.3(d);
_provided_ that if the Arbitrator has not resolved any such dispute prior to
the due date of any Pre-Closing Return, the Purchaser shall be entitled to
file such Pre-Closing Return reflecting the Purchasers position, and shall
file an amendment to such Pre-Closing Return if the Arbitrator determines
that such amendment is appropriate. Upon the Purchasers receipt of any refund
of Taxes with respect to any Pre-Closing Return that were paid by the Company
or its Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing Date or by the Seller pursuant
to this

 



- 57 \-  Agreement, the Purchaser will pay such refund to the Seller within five (5)
days of the receipt of such refund, except to the extent such refund was taken
into account as a Current Asset in the final determination of Closing Date
Working Capital; _provided_ that if any such refund is subsequently disallowed
by the relevant Taxing Governmental Entity (a " _Disallowed Tax Refund_ "),
the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to such Disallowed Tax
Refund within five (5) days of such disallowance. The Seller and the Purchaser
shall reasonably and in good faith cooperate regarding the contents and filing
of all Pre-Closing Returns. Where the filing of any Pre-Closing Returns will
be extended, if the Seller or its Tax Return preparer is unable to execute and
file an extension, or if any Taxes are due with such extension, the Seller
will provide a completed extension request to the Purchaser at least five (5)
days prior to the filing deadline for such request and will pay the Purchaser
any amount due with such request at the same time.

 

8.2 _Tax Periods Beginning On or Before and Ending On or After the Closing
Date_. The Purchaser shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or
cause to be filed, any Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiary for, in
the case of Income Tax Returns, Tax periods which begin on or before and end
after the Closing Date and in the case of other Tax Returns, Tax periods
which begin before the Closing Date and end on or after the Closing Date (any
such period, a " _Straddle Period_ " and any such Tax Return, a " _Straddle
Return_ "). The Purchaser will cause all Straddle Returns to be timely filed,
and will provide a copy of each Straddle Return that is an Income Tax Return
(each, a " _Straddle Income Tax Return_ ") to the Seller at least thirty (30)
days prior to filing for the Sellers review and reasonable comment. The
Seller shall provide the Purchaser with any comments on all such Straddle
Income Tax Returns within fifteen (15) days of the Sellers receipt of the
same; provided, that if no comments are received by the Purchaser from
the Seller within this timeframe, the Seller agrees that the Purchaser may
assume that the Seller has no comments. The Purchaser and the Seller shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputes regarding any Straddle Income
Tax Return, and if the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve any
such dispute at least 10 days before the due date for filing of such Straddle
Income Tax Return, such dispute shall be resolved by the Arbitrator in
accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in _Section
2.3(d)_; provided that if the Arbitrator has not resolved any such dispute
prior to the due date for the related Straddle Income Tax Return, the
Purchaser shall be entitled to file such Straddle Income Tax
Return reflecting the Purchasers position, and shall file an amendment to
such Straddle Income Tax Return if the Arbitrator determines that such
amendment is appropriate. All Straddle Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice of the Company and the Seller (as applicable)
in preparing similar Tax Returns, except to the extent required by applicable
Law. The Seller and the Purchaser shall reasonably and in good faith cooperate
regarding the contents and filing of all Straddle Returns. Not later than
five (5) days prior to the due date for payment of Taxes with respect to any
Straddle Return, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser the amount of any
Seller Taxes shown as due on such Straddle Return. Upon the receipt of any
Tax refund with respect to any Straddle Return that were paid by the Company
or its Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing Date or by the Seller pursuant to
this Agreement, the Purchaser will pay the portion of such
refund attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending at the end
of the Closing Date to the Seller within five (5) days of the receipt of such
refund, except to the extent such refund was taken into account as a Current
Asset in the final determination of Closing Date Net Working Capital;
provided that if any such refund is subsequently determined to be a Disallowed
Tax

 



- 58 \-  Refund, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser the amount of such Disallowed
Tax Refund that is attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending
at the end of the Closing Date within five (5) days of its receipt from the
Purchaser of notice of such disallowance.

8.3 _Straddle Period Taxes_. For all purposes under this Agreement, in the
case of Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the
portion of any such Taxes that is attributable to the portion of the period
ending, in the case of any Straddle Period for Income Taxes, at the end of
the Closing Date, and in the case of any other Straddle Period, at the end of
the day before the Closing Date, shall be:

(a) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis with respect to
the assets or capital of the Seller (without regard, in any event, to income,
gross receipts, sales or use), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period),
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending at the end of the day
before the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period; and

 

(b) in the case of any other Taxes, deemed equal to the amount that would be
payable if the Tax period of the Seller ended, in the case of any Straddle
Period for Income Taxes, at the end of the Closing Date, and in the case of
any other Straddle Period, at the end of the day before the Closing Date.

 

8.4 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

 

(a) The Purchaser, the Company and the Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by the other Parties, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Article VIII_ and any audit,
litigation, refund claim or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys
request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
Purchaser, the Company and the Seller agree to retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute
of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Purchaser or the Seller,
any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Governmental Entity.

 

(b) The Seller shall obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited
to, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby). The Purchaser and
the Company shall reasonably and in good faith cooperate with the Seller
as necessary to allow the Seller to obtain such items.

(c) The Purchaser, the Company and the Seller further agree, upon request, to
provide the other Party with all information that either Party may be
required to report pursuant to Section 6043A of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder.

 



- 59 \- 8.5 _Certain Taxes_. The Seller and the Purchaser shall each be responsible
for the payment of fifty percent (50%) of any transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and administrative fees (including
any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement
(together, " _Transfer Taxes_ ").

8.6 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. For purposes of the Tax Elections, within
sixty (60) days following the final determination of Final Net Working
Capital in accordance with _Section 2.3_, the Purchaser shall provide the
Seller with a proposed allocation of the "adjusted grossed-up basis" as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-5(a) (" _AGUB_ ") among the
assets of the Company in accordance with Treasury Regulation Sections 1.338-6
and 1.338-7 and the principles set forth on _Exhibit 8.6_ (as finally
determined pursuant to this  _Section 8.6_ and including any subsequent
adjustment thereto pursuant to this _Section 8.6_, the " _Allocation
Schedule_ "). In the case of any adjustment to the AGUB requiring an amendment
to the Allocation Schedule, the Purchaser shall prepare such amendment and
such amended Allocation Schedule shall, subject to the review and dispute
resolution provisions of this _Section 8.6_, become the Allocation Schedule.
Upon receipt from the Purchaser, the Seller shall have thirty (30) days to
review the determinations set forth in the Allocation Schedule (the "
_Allocation Review Period_ "). If the Seller disagrees with any of the
Purchasers determinations set forth in the Allocation Schedule, the Seller
shall, on or prior to the last day of the Allocation Review Period, deliver a
written notice to the Purchaser (the " _Allocation Notice of Objection_ "),
setting forth its objections. Unless the Seller delivers the Allocation
Notice of Objection to the Purchaser within the Allocation Review Period, the
Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the determinations set forth in the
Allocation Schedule as proposed by the Purchaser. If the Seller delivers the
Allocation Notice of Objection to the Purchaser within the Allocation Review
Period, the Purchaser and the Seller shall, during the thirty (30) days
following such delivery or any mutually agreed extension thereof, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed
determinations. At the end of any such period or any mutually agreed extension
thereof, any remaining disputes between the Purchaser and the Seller regarding
the Allocation Schedule shall be resolved by the Arbitrator in accordance
with the dispute resolution mechanism set forth in _Section 2.3(d)_. Neither
the Seller nor the Purchaser shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax
Returns or otherwise, and, in the case of the Seller, in determining the
"aggregate deemed sales price" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.338-4) that is inconsistent with the Tax Elections and the
Allocation Schedule, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 8.6_
(including any amended Allocation Schedule, if applicable) unless required to
do so by a Tax Determination.

 

8.7 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax allocation, sharing, distribution,
gross-up or indemnity Contracts or similar agreements (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, this Agreement) between the Company or its Subsidiary, on
the one hand, and the Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand,
shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date,
the Company and its Subsidiary shall not be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder.

8.8 _Amendments_. Except as otherwise required by Law, the Purchaser and the
Company shall not amend any Tax Returns for the Company for all periods ending
on or prior to the Closing Date without the Sellers prior written consent,
which may be withheld in the Sellers sole and absolute discretion.

MISCELLANEOUS

9.1  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Transition Services Agreement
contain the entire agreement among Parties to this Agreement with respect to
the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and shall only be modified or
amended by an instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of the Parties to
this Agreement. No failure of any Party to exercise any right or remedy given
to such Party under this Agreement or otherwise available to such Party or to
insist upon strict compliance by any other Party with its or his obligations
hereunder, and no custom or practice of the Parties in variance with the terms
hereof, shall constitute a waiver of any Partys right to demand exact
compliance with the terms hereof. Any written waiver shall be limited to
those items specifically waived therein and shall not be deemed to waive any
future breaches or violations or other non-specified breaches or violations
unless, and to the extent, expressly set forth therein.

 

9.2 _Section Headings; Interpretation; Disclosure Schedules_. Reference in
this Agreement to a Section, Article, or Schedule, unless otherwise
indicated, shall constitute references to a Section or an Article of this
Agreement or a Section of the Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be. The
section headings and article titles contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and do not form a part of this Agreement and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or the interpretation of this
Agreement. Wherever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "herein" "hereinafter," and "hereunder," and words of
similar import used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The singular of a
term shall also include the plural of that term and the plural shall also
include the singular and the masculine shall include the feminine, unless
the context clearly indicates otherwise. The schedule numbers in the
Disclosure Schedule correspond to the section numbers in this Agreement;
provided, however, that any information disclosed in one schedule of the
Disclosure Schedule constitutes disclosure for purposes of all other
schedules of the Disclosure Schedule where cross-reference of scheduled items
is included or where such applicability is readily apparent from the text of
the disclosure; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the matters set forth in any Section or subsection
of the Disclosure Schedule other than those corresponding to _Articles III_ or
_Article IV_ shall not be deemed to be disclosed on any Section or subsection
of the Disclosure Schedule corresponding to _Articles III_ or _Article IV_.
The Parties intend that each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement
contained herein shall have independent significance. If any Party
has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the same subject matter that the
Party has not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the
Party is in breach of the first representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement. All uses of "written" contained in _Articles III_ and _IV_ shall be
deemed to include information transmitted via electronic mail, facsimile or
other electronic transmission. For purposes of _Article III_ , information
shall be deemed to have been "delivered"

 



- 61 \-  or "made available" to the Purchaser only if such information was posted to
the electronic data room maintained by Robert W. Baird and Co. Incorporated in a
manner accessible and reviewable by the Purchaser at least 2 days prior to
the date hereof. The Parties agree that any drafts of this Agreement or any
Transaction Document prior to the final fully executed drafts shall not be
used for purposes of interpreting any provision of this Agreement or any
Transaction Document, and each of the Parties agrees that no Party,
Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party shall make any claim, assert any
defense or otherwise take any position inconsistent with the foregoing
in connection with any dispute or Legal Proceeding among any of the foregoing
or for any other purpose.

9.3 _Notices_. Any notice hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed
given if personally delivered to the other Party or if delivered by confirmed

such records, specifying in reasonable detail the contents of the records to
be destroyed. The Party receiving such notice shall thereupon have 30

shall transfer the records to the objecting Party, who shall be responsible

therewith.
