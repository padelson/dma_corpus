share has been issued to ACI and one share has been issued to Bowater. ACI and Bowater shall take,
and shall cause Parent to take, all requisite action to cause (i)&nbsp;the certificate of incorporation
of Parent to be substantially in the form of, and with the content provided in, Exhibit&nbsp;E hereto

approvals required with respect to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, at or prior to the Effective Time (but to be

validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and are owned by Parent free and clear of any
pledges, liens, charges, encumbrances or security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (other
than statutory liens for current Taxes not yet due) (collectively, &#147;<I>Liens</I>&#148;).

Confidentiality Agreement and, along with certain other parties, a Supplemental Confidentiality and
Joint Defence Agreement, each dated as of October&nbsp;18, 2006 (together, the &#147;<I>Confidentiality
Agreements</I>&#148;), which Confidentiality Agreements will continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<I>Access to Information</I>. Each of Bowater and ACI will (and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) afford the other party and its accountants, counsel and other representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to its properties, books,
records, Contracts and personnel during the period prior to the Effective Time to obtain all
information concerning its business, properties, results of operations and personnel, as may be
reasonably requested. No information or knowledge obtained by any party in any investigation
pursuant to this Section&nbsp;7.01(b) will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Arrangement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and in accordance with the provisions set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreements, (i)&nbsp;either party may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that
any Law (including Laws relating to the exchange of information and all applicable antitrust,
competition and similar Laws, and attorney-client and other privileges) applicable to such party
requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit such access and (ii)&nbsp;nothing herein
shall require any party to disclose information to the extent such information would result in a
waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or similar privilege or violate any
confidentiality obligation of such party existing as of the date hereof (provided that such party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to permit such disclosure to be made in a manner
consistent with the protection of such privilege or to obtain any consent required to permit such
disclosure to be made without violation of such confidentiality obligations, as applicable). The
parties will hold any information obtained pursuant to this Section&nbsp;7.01(b) in confidence in
accordance with, and otherwise subject to, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements.

Shares (other than any Exchangeable Shares owned by Bowater or any of its Affiliates) are
outstanding, (1)&nbsp;Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that ExchangeCo (or
any successor thereto as the issuer of the Exchangeable Shares) will continue to be a &#147;taxable
Canadian corporation&#148; and a &#147;public corporation&#148; within the meaning of the Canadian Tax Act (as of
the Effective Time and any modifications of such definitions which are consistent with the general
principle thereof), and (2)&nbsp;Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the
Exchangeable Shares are listed on a &#147;prescribed stock exchange in Canada&#148; within the meaning of the
Canadian Tax Act (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such definition which are
consistent with the general principle thereof). This covenant shall survive the Effective Time.

party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur and
that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the courts of the State of New York and the federal courts of the
United States of America located in the State of New York, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereto agrees to waive
any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party with respect to any
action or proceeding, including an appeal thereof. In addition, each of the parties hereto
irrevocably (a)&nbsp;consents to submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts of
the State of New York and the federal courts of the United States of America located in the State
of New York in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)&nbsp;agrees that all claims in respect of such action
or proceeding may be heard and determined only in any such court, (c)&nbsp;agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion, pleading or other request for leave
from any such court, (d)&nbsp;agrees that it will not bring any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than a court of the
State of New York or a federal court of the United States of America located in the State of New
York, and (e)&nbsp;waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or
proceeding so brought (including waiver of any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of any other party with respect thereto). The parties hereby consent to and grant any
such court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute
and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such Action in the manner
provided in Section&nbsp;10.02 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and
sufficient service thereof.

it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party hereto (a)&nbsp;certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that
such party would not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver and (b)&nbsp;acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into
this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section&nbsp;10.09.
