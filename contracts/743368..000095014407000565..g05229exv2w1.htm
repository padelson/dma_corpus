 SECTION 2.08 _Joint Proxy Statement; Meetings; Change in Recommendation_. 

  

 (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, ACI, Bowater and ExchangeCo shall complete the Joint Proxy Statement together with any other documents required by the Securities Laws or other applicable Law in connection with the ACI Meeting, the Bowater Meeting and the ExchangeCo Meeting. ACI and Bowater shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to have the Joint Proxy Statement cleared, if applicable, by the SEC and any other applicable Governmental Authority. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the " _Form S-4_"), in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under the 1933 Act of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock and Exchangeable Shares in the Arrangement. Each of Parent, ACI and Bowater shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the  ##### 

 

 

16  

1933 Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and, prior to the
effective date of the Form S-4, Parent shall take all action reasonably
required (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which
it is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of process)
to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in connection with the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger and the issuance of
shares of Parent Common Stock and Exchangeable Shares in the Arrangement. As
promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
such clearance and effectiveness of the Form S-4, ACI and Bowater shall,
unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, cause the Joint Proxy Statement and
other documentation required in connection with the ACI Meeting, the Bowater
Meeting and the ExchangeCo Meeting to be sent contemporaneously to (x) in the
case of ACI, each holder of ACI Common Shares as of the record date fixed in
respect of the ACI Meeting and filed as required by the Interim Order and
applicable Law, (y) in the case of Bowater, each holder of Bowater Common
Stock and each holder of Exchangeable Shares as of the record date fixed in
respect of the Bowater Meeting, as required by applicable Law and (z) in the
case of ExchangeCo, each holder of Exchangeable Shares as of the record date
fixed in respect of the ExchangeCo Meeting, as required by applicable Law.
Prior to the date of the initial filing of the Joint Proxy Statement the
parties may mutually agree to file a separate proxy statement/prospectus of
Bowater or management circular of ACI or ExchangeCo in lieu thereof. If the
issuance of Exchangeable Shares in the Arrangement is eligible for
an exemption from registration under the 1933 Act, or if such registration
may be effected by means of an alternative form to the Form S-4 (an "
_Alternative Form_ "), and in either case such exemption or Alternative Form
represents a more efficient method for effecting the issuance of the
Exchangeable Shares, then the parties shall cooperate in good faith to permit
such issuance to be made under such exemption from registration or under such
Alternative Form. In each case described in the immediately preceding
sentence, the parties shall cooperate with respect to such actions in
a manner consistent with Section 2.10. 

  

 (b) Subject to Section 6.05, ACI and its Board of Directors shall (i) take all lawful action to solicit in favor of the ACI Shareholder Approval, (ii) recommend to all holders of ACI Common Shares that they vote in favor of this Agreement and the Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (iii) not withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify (or publicly propose to or publicly state that it intends to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Bowater such recommendation or take any other action or make any other public statement in connection with the ACI Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation (any of the actions in clause (iii), a " _Change in ACI Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of ACI may make a Change in ACI Recommendation in accordance with Section 6.05(b). In connection with a Change in ACI Recommendation, ACI may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement, or separate management circular filed pursuant to Section 2.08(a) (including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment to effect such a Change in ACI Recommendation. 

  

 (c) Subject to Section 6.05, Bowater and its Board of Directors shall (i) take all lawful action to solicit in favor of the Bowater Stockholder Approval and in favor of the Exchangeable Share Provision Amendment by the holders of Exchangeable Shares at the ExchangeCo Meeting, (ii) recommend to holders of Bowater Common Stock and to holders of Exchangeable Shares that they vote in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, (iii) recommend to holders of Exchangeable Shares that they vote in favor of the  ##### 

 

 

17   

Exchangeable Share Provision Amendment, and (iv) not withhold, withdraw,
modify or qualify (or publicly propose to or publicly state that it intends
to withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to ACI such
recommendation or take any other action or make any other public statement in
connection with the Bowater Meeting or the ExchangeCo Meeting inconsistent
with such recommendation (any of the actions in clause (iii), a " _Change in
Bowater Recommendation_ " and, together with a Change in ACI Recommendation,
a " _Change in Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board
of Directors of Bowater may make a Change in Bowater Recommendation
in accordance with Section 6.05(b). In connection with a Change in Bowater
Recommendation, Bowater may amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement, or
separate proxy statement filed pursuant to Section 2.08(a) (including by
incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment to effect such
a Change in Bowater Recommendation. 

  

 (d) Any Change in Recommendation shall not be interpreted as rescinding the approval of this Agreement by the Boards of Directors of each of ACI and Bowater or any other approval of the Board of Directors of ACI or Bowater, including in any respect that would have the effect of causing any corporate takeover statute or other similar statute to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (e) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, ACI and Bowater shall each use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the ACI Meeting, the Bowater Meeting and the ExchangeCo Meeting to be held on the same date. Each of ACI and Bowater shall not adjourn, postpone or cancel (or propose for adjournment, postponement or cancellation) the ACI Meeting, the Bowater Meeting or the ExchangeCo Meeting, as applicable, without the other partyÂ’s prior written consent, in each case, except as may be required (i) by applicable Law or an Order, (ii) in order to solicit and obtain the requisite vote of its stockholders or shareholders, as the case may be, (iii) for quorum purposes or (iv) to enable ACI or Bowater, as applicable, to comply with its obligations under Section 6.05(b). 

  

 SECTION 2.09 _Additional Securities Matters_. 

  

 (a) Parent, Bowater and ExchangeCo shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Orders required from the applicable Governmental Authorities to permit (i) the issuance and first resale of the Exchangeable Shares and Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to the Arrangement, and (ii) the issuance and first resale of the Parent Common Stock to be issued from time to time upon exchange of the Exchangeable Shares and upon the exercise of the Parent Stock Options, in each case without further qualification with or approval of or the filing of any document including any registration statement, prospectus or similar document, or the taking of any proceeding with, or the obtaining of any further Order or consent from, any Governmental Authority under any Securities Laws or other Laws or pursuant to the rules and regulations of any regulatory authority administering such Laws, or the fulfillment of any other legal requirement in any applicable jurisdiction (other than, with respect to such first resales, any restrictions on transfer by reason of, among other things, such first resale constituting a "control distribution" or the holder effecting such first resale being an "affiliate" of ACI, Bowater or ExchangeCo for purposes of Securities Laws and other customary qualifications for such Orders).  ##### 

 

 

18  

 (b) Parent, ACI and Bowater shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the approval of the NYSE and the TSX for the listing of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or upon exercise of Parent Stock Options or exchange of the Exchangeable Shares, subject to notice of issuance, such listings to be effective prior to the Effective Time.

 (e) Parent shall file a registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor form or, if Form S-3 is not available, other appropriate forms) (the " _Form S-3_") in order to register under the 1933 Act the Parent Common Stock to be issued from time to time after the Effective Time upon exchange of Exchangeable Shares, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective at or prior to the Effective Time and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for the period of time that such Exchangeable Shares remain outstanding.

S-4, the Form S-3 or the Form S-8. 

  

 (b) Each of Bowater and ACI shall furnish to the other and to Parent all such information concerning it and its stockholders or shareholders (or the holders of Exchangeable Shares) as may reasonably be required (and, in the case of its stockholders or shareholders or those of ExchangeCo, available to it) for the effectuation of the actions described in Section 2.08 and Section 2.09 and the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.10.

At the Effective Time, all shares of Bowater Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Bowater Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 3.01(c) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Bowater Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Bowater Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 3.02(e), in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 3.02(b), without interest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Common Stock, Bowater Common Stock, ACI Common Shares or Exchangeable Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of the occurrence or  ##### 

 

 

21

Pursuant to the amendment to the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement contemplated in Section 2.05(b), the one issued and outstanding share of Bowater Special Preferred Stock shall be cancelled and replaced by one share of Parent Special Preferred Stock having the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions set forth in the Parent Certificate of Designation. 

  

 SECTION 3.02 _Exchange of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to ACI and Bowater (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock in the aggregate amount equal to the number of shares into which shares of Bowater Common Stock have been converted. In addition, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 3.02(e). All shares of Parent Common Stock, dividends and distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 3.02(a) shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Bowater Exchange Fund_ ". 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Bowater Common Stock were converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 3.02(e): (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in customary form and contain customary provisions) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 3.02(e). Each holder of record of one or more Certificates shall, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of such Certificate or Certificates, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (i) a certificate or certificates representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(c), (ii) any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.02(c) and (iii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 3.02(e), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Bowater Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Bowater, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued in accordance with this Section 3.02(b) to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such  ##### 

 

 

22   

payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
transfer or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such
Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 3.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.01(c), any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.02(c) and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 3.02(e). No interest shall
be paid or will accrue on any payment to holders of Certificates pursuant to
the provisions of this ARTICLE III. 

  

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 3.02(e), in each case until the holder of such Certificate shall have surrendered such Certificate in accordance with this ARTICLE III. Following the surrender of any Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional Parent Share to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.02(e) and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Bowater Common Stock_. The shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon conversion of the shares of Bowater Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof and the payment of such dividends or other distributions as are payable pursuant to Section 3.02(c) and such cash in lieu of any fractional shares as is payable pursuant to Section 3.02(e) upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE III shall be deemed to have been in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Bowater Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to the Surviving CorporationÂ’s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by Bowater on the shares of Bowater Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of Bowater shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Bowater Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

23  

 (e) _No Fractional Shares_. 

  

 (i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividends or other distributions of Parent shall relate to such fractional share interests and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent. 

  

 (ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (x) the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to Section 3.02(a) over (y) the aggregate number of full shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to holders of Bowater Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.02(c) (such excess being herein called the " _Excess Shares_ "). Following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of Bowater Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on the NYSE, all in the manner provided in paragraph (iii) of this Section 3.02(e). 

  

 (iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. The Exchange Agent shall use all reasonable efforts to complete the sale of the Excess Shares as promptly following the Effective Time as, in the Exchange AgentÂ’s reasonable judgment, is practicable consistent with obtaining the best execution of such sales in light of prevailing market conditions. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the former holders of Bowater Common Stock, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of Bowater Common Stock (the " _Excess Shares Trust_ "). Parent shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation, of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale of the Excess Shares. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Excess Shares Trust to which each holder of Bowater Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Excess Shares Trust by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of Bowater Common Stock is entitled (after taking into account all shares of Bowater Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of Bowater Common Stock are entitled. 

  

 (iv) Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding clauses (ii) and (iii), Parent may elect, at its option, to pay to each holder of a Certificate an aggregate amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of Bowater Common Stock formerly represented by all Certificates surrendered by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the product of (x) the Bowater Exchange Ratio multiplied by (y) the per share closing price of shares of Bowater Common Stock on the last trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date, as such price is reported on the NYSE Composite Transaction Tape, as applicable, (as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets or such other source as the parties shall agree in writing).  ##### 

 

 

24  

 (v) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, no shares of Bowater Common Stock that are owned by a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be entitled to receive cash pursuant to this Section 3.02(e) and no such shares will be taken into account in determining the amount of cash to which any other holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 3.02(e). 

  

 (f) _Termination of the Bowater Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Bowater Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE III shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for shares of Parent Common Stock, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 3.02(e) in accordance with this ARTICLE III. 

  

 (g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, ACI, Bowater, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock, dividends or other distributions from the Bowater Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to three years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares of Parent Common Stock (and any dividends or other distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.02(e)) would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such shares (and any dividends or other distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 3.02(e)) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (h) _Investment of Bowater Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Bowater Exchange Fund as directed by Parent. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be income of Parent. If for any reason (including losses on any investments) the cash in the Bowater Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Bowater Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. 

  

 (i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shares of Parent Common Stock, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.02(c) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 3.02(e), in each case pursuant to this ARTICLE III.  ##### 

 

 

25  

 (j) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of provincial or state or local or other Tax Law of any applicable country or jurisdiction. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Certificates in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent. 

  

 SECTION 3.03 _Bowater Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_. 

  

 (a) Each option to purchase shares of Bowater Common Stock (a " _Bowater Stock Option_ ") and each stock appreciation right with respect to shares of Bowater Common Stock (a " _Bowater SAR_ ") granted under the employee and director stock plans of Bowater (the " _Bowater Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent respectively a right to acquire shares of Bowater Common Stock or a stock appreciation right with respect to shares of Bowater Common Stock and shall be converted (except for those Bowater Stock Options and Bowater SARs that are required to be repurchased by Bowater in accordance with the applicable terms of the Bowater Stock Plans), at the Effective Time, into respectively a Parent Stock Option and a Parent SAR, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Bowater Stock Option or Bowater SAR (but taking into account any changes thereto, including the acceleration thereof, provided for in Bowater Stock Plans, in any award agreement or in such Bowater Stock Option on Bowater SAR by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby). The number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such Parent Stock Option or Parent SAR shall be the number of shares of Bowater Common Stock subject to each such Bowater Stock Option or Bowater SAR, respectively, multiplied by the Bowater Exchange Ratio (with the resulting product rounded to the nearest whole share), and such Parent Stock Option or Parent SAR shall have an exercise price (or base price) per share equal to the per share exercise price (or base price) specified in such Bowater Stock Option or Bowater SAR, respectively, divided by the Bowater Exchange Ratio (with the resulting quotient rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a cent;  _ _provided__ _,_ _ _however__ , that in the case of any Parent Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code as of the Effective Time applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Parent Stock Option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such Parent Stock Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code). 

  

 (b) At the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to receive shares of Bowater Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of a number of shares of Bowater Common Stock, and each award of any kind consisting of shares of Bowater Common Stock, granted under Bowater Stock Plans (including restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units and dividend equivalents), other than Bowater Stock Options or Bowater SARs (each, a " _Bowater Stock-Based Award_ "), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right or award with respect to shares of Bowater Common Stock and shall be converted (except for any  ##### 

 

 

26   

Bowater Stock-Based Award that is required to be repurchased by Bowater in
accordance with the applicable terms of the Bowater Stock Plans), at the
Effective Time, into a Parent Stock-Based Award, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under Bowater Stock-Based Awards (but taking
into account any changes thereto, including the acceleration thereof, provided
for in Bowater Stock Plans, in any award agreement or in such Bowater Stock-
Based Award by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby). The number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such
Parent Stock-Based Award shall be equal to the number of shares of
Bowater Common Stock subject to Bowater Stock-Based Awards, multiplied by the
Bowater Exchange Ratio (with the resulting product rounded to the nearest
whole share). All dividend equivalents credited to the account of each holder
of a Bowater Stock-Based Award as of the Effective Time shall remain credited
to such holderÂ’s account immediately following the Effective Time, subject to
adjustment in accordance with the foregoing. 

  

 (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Bowater Stock Options, Bowater SARs and Bowater Stock-Based Awards appropriate notices setting forth such holdersÂ’ rights pursuant to the respective Bowater Stock Plans and agreements evidencing the grants of such Bowater Stock Options, Bowater SARs and Bowater Stock-Based Awards, and stating that such Bowater Stock Options, Bowater SARs and Bowater Stock-Based Awards and agreements have been assumed by Parent and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 3.03 after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of Bowater Stock Plans). 

  

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, Bowater shall take all necessary action for the adjustment of Bowater Stock Options, Bowater SARs and Bowater Stock-Based Awards under this Section 3.03. Parent shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will be subject to Parent Stock Options, Parent SARs and Parent Stock-Based Awards as a result of the actions contemplated by this Section 3.03. 

  

 (e) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the same terms, conditions and methodology described in this Section 3.03 and used by Bowater to convert Bowater Stock Options, Bowater SARs and Bowater Stock-Based Awards into Parent Stock Options, Parent SARs and Parent Stock-Based Awards, respectively, shall be the same terms, conditions and methodology applicable to convert ACI Stock Options, ACI SARs and ACI Share-Based Awards described in the Plan of Arrangement. 

  

 (f) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Section 3.03, in no event shall a Bowater Stock Option, Bowater SAR or Bowater Stock-Based Award become subject to Code Section 409A because of the conversion described in this Section 3.03.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BOWATER 

   

 Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Bowater to ACI prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Bowater Disclosure Schedule_ ") (with specific reference  ##### 

 

 

27  

to the particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the
information set forth in such disclosure schedule relates (and such items or
matters disclosed in other sections of the Bowater Disclosure Schedule to the
extent the relevance of such items or matters to the referenced Section or
subsection of this Agreement is reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure)) (it being understood and agreed by the parties that individual
sections in this ARTICLE IV do not contain any references to such Bowater
Disclosure Schedule), Bowater represents and warrants to ACI as follows: 

  

 SECTION 4.01 _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Bowater and each of its Subsidiaries has been duly organized or amalgamated, as applicable, and is validly existing and in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions for which that concept is applicable) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, formation or amalgamation, as the case may be, and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease or otherwise hold and operate its properties and other assets and to carry on its activities as currently conducted, except where the failure to be so qualified individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Bowater Material Adverse Effect. Bowater and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions for which that concept is applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its activities or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Bowater Material Adverse Effect. Bowater has made available to ACI, prior to the date of this Agreement, complete and accurate copies of the certificate of incorporation of Bowater, as currently in effect (the " _Bowater Certificate_ ") and the bylaws of Bowater, as currently in effect (the " _Bowater Bylaws_ "). 

  

 SECTION 4.02 _Subsidiaries_. Section 4.02 of the Bowater Disclosure Schedule lists, as of the date hereof, each material Subsidiary of Bowater. All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each material Subsidiary of Bowater, is directly or indirectly owned by Bowater. All the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each such material Subsidiary owned by Bowater have been validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable and, except for the Exchangeable Shares, are owned directly or indirectly by Bowater free and clear of all Liens, and free of any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity interests (other than restrictions imposed by Securities Laws). Except for the Subsidiaries of Bowater, Bowater does not own, directly or indirectly, as of the date hereof, any capital stock of, or other voting securities or equity interests in, any material corporation, partnership, joint venture, association or other entity. There are no options, warrants, conversion privileges or other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments obligating any material Subsidiary of Bowater to issue or sell any shares of any material Subsidiary of Bowater or securities or obligations of any kind convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of any material Subsidiary of Bowater. 

  

 SECTION 4.03 _Capital Structure_. As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of Bowater consists of 100,000,000 shares of Bowater Common Stock, 9,999,999 shares of serial preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Bowater (" _Bowater Preferred Stock_ ") and one share of special voting preferred stock, par value $1.00 per share of Bowater (" _Bowater Special Preferred Stock_ "). At the close of business on December 31, 2006, (i) 57,408,218 shares  ##### 

 

 

28   

of Bowater Common Stock were issued and outstanding, (ii) no shares of Bowater
Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, (iii) one share of Bowater
Special Preferred Stock was issued and outstanding, (iv) 5,653,226 shares of
Bowater Common Stock were subject to outstanding Bowater Stock Options or
BowaterÂ’s obligation to issue shares of Bowater Common Stock granted under
the Bowater Stock Plans and other employment arrangements and (v) 1,423,830
shares of Bowater Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon exercise of
exchange rights under the Exchangeable Shares. Section 4.03 of the Bowater
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list, as of December
31, 2006, of all outstanding Bowater Stock Options, Bowater SARs and Bowater
Stock-Based Awards, granted under Bowater Stock Plans or otherwise, the
number of shares of Bowater Common Stock subject thereto, the grant dates,
expiration dates, exercise or base prices (if applicable) and vesting
schedules thereof and the names of the holders thereof. The authorized capital
of ExchangeCo consists of an unlimited number of common shares, an unlimited
number of non-voting exchangeable shares (" _Exchangeable Shares_ ") and
1,000 non-voting preferred shares. As of December 31, 2006 there were
86,844,900 common shares of ExchangeCo outstanding, all of which are owned by
CallCo, 1,423,830 Exchangeable Shares of ExchangeCo outstanding and no non-
voting preferred shares of ExchangeCo outstanding. All outstanding Bowater
Stock Options, Bowater SARs and Bowater Stock-Based Awards are evidenced by
stock option agreements, restricted stock agreements or other award
agreements in each case in the forms set forth in Section 4.03 of the Bowater
Disclosure Schedule, and no stock option agreement, restricted stock agreement
or other award agreement contains terms that are inconsistent with such
forms. Each Bowater Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock
option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies and the exercise price of
each other Bowater Stock Option is no less than the fair market value of
a share of Bowater Common Stock as determined on the date of grant of such
Bowater Stock Option. Except as set forth above in this Section 4.03, as of

securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for capital
stock or voting securities of Bowater. No bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of Bowater having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on
which the stockholders of Bowater may vote are issued or outstanding.

Neither Bowater nor any Subsidiary or Commonly Controlled Bowater Entity has
any Contract, whether formal or informal, to create any additional material
benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement of the nature described above or
to amend any existing Bowater Benefit Plan. Each Bowater Benefit Plan that is

provision of ERISA refer to all plans, programs, policies or Contracts that
fall within such meaning, regardless of whether the plan, program, policy

Bowater has provided to ACI a complete and accurate list of all amendments to any Bowater Pension Plan as to which a favorable determination letter has not yet been received or, in the case of a Canadian Bowater Pension Plan, if any, for which registration has not been confirmed.

The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has not instituted proceedings under Section 4042 of ERISA to terminate any Bowater Benefit Plan and, to the Knowledge of Bowater, no condition exists that presents a material risk that such proceedings will be instituted. No event has occurred, and to the Knowledge of Bowater no condition, exists, that would be reasonably expected to subject Bowater, any Subsidiary of Bowater or any Commonly Controlled Bowater Entity or any Bowater Benefit Plan, to any Tax, fine, Lien, penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Law with respect to any Bowater Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA. All contributions under the Bowater Pension Plans that are required to have been made as of the date hereof in accordance with the terms of the Bowater Pension Plans and applicable Law and Orders have been timely made or, if not yet due, have been reflected in the Bowater Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP.  #####

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

   

 SECTION 7.01 _Confidentiality; Access to Information and Certain Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) _Confidentiality_. The parties acknowledge that ACI and Bowater have previously executed a Confidentiality Agreement and, along with certain other parties, a Supplemental Confidentiality and Joint Defence Agreement, each dated as of October 18, 2006 (together, the " _Confidentiality Agreements_ "), which Confidentiality Agreements will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. 

  

 (b) _Access to Information_. Each of Bowater and ACI will (and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford the other party and its accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to its properties, books, records, Contracts and personnel during the period prior to the Effective Time to obtain all information concerning its business, properties, results of operations and personnel, as may be reasonably requested. No information or knowledge obtained by any party in any investigation pursuant to this Section 7.01(b) will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Arrangement. Notwithstanding the foregoing and in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Confidentiality Agreements, (i) either party may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that any Law (including Laws relating to the exchange of information and all applicable antitrust, competition and similar Laws, and attorney-client and other privileges) applicable to such party requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit such access and (ii) nothing herein shall require any party to disclose information to the extent such information would result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or similar privilege or violate any confidentiality obligation of such party existing as of the date hereof (provided that such party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to permit such disclosure to be made in a manner consistent with the protection of such privilege or to obtain any consent required to permit such disclosure to be made without violation of such confidentiality obligations, as applicable). The parties will hold any information obtained pursuant to this Section 7.01(b) in confidence in accordance with, and otherwise subject to, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements. 

  

 (c) _Post-Effective Time Covenants_. Following the Effective Time and while any Exchangeable Shares (other than any Exchangeable Shares owned by Bowater or any of its Affiliates) are outstanding, (1) Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that ExchangeCo (or any successor thereto as the issuer of the Exchangeable Shares) will continue to be a "taxable Canadian corporation" and a "public corporation" within the meaning of the Canadian Tax Act (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such definitions which are consistent with the general principle thereof), and (2) Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Exchangeable Shares are listed on a "prescribed stock exchange in Canada" within the meaning of the Canadian Tax Act (as of the Effective Time and any modifications of such definition which are consistent with the general principle thereof). This covenant shall survive the Effective Time.  ##### 

 

 

75  

 (d) _Tax-Deferred Transaction_. None of Bowater, CallCo or ExchangeCo shall take any action which could reasonably be expected to prevent the exchange of ACI Common Shares for consideration that includes Exchangeable Shares under the Arrangement by the validly-electing Canadian resident holders of ACI Common Shares who make and file a valid tax election under subsection 85(1) or (2) of the Canadian Tax Act as described and on the terms set forth in the Plan of Arrangement from being treated as a tax deferred transaction for purposes of the Canadian Tax Act if such holders are otherwise eligible for such treatment. 

  

 (e) _Actions Affecting Exchangeable Shares_. So long as any outstanding Exchangeable Shares are owned by any person other than Bowater or any of its Affiliates, Parent shall not, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to not, take any action relating to a plan or agreement of complete or partial liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, merger, consolidation, continuation, change of residence, amalgamation, restructuring, recapitalization or other material reorganization of ExchangeCo or its successors or CallCo or its successors, as the case may be, that results, prior to a Redemption Date (as that term is defined in the share provisions that apply to the Exchangeable Shares), in (1) the recognition under the Canadian Tax Act (or the provincial equivalent) of any accrued gain on a holderÂ’s Exchangeable Shares, recognition of which was deferred on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (2) dividends on the Exchangeable Shares being ineligible for the dividend gross-up and tax credit under the Canadian Tax Act (or the provincial equivalent) for individuals resident in Canada for purposes of the Canadian Tax Act and the inter-corporate dividend deduction under the Canadian Tax Act (or the provincial equivalent) for corporations resident in Canada for purposes of the Canadian Tax Act, or (3) dividends on the Exchangeable Shares being subject to withholding tax (other than withholding tax imposed under the Laws of Canada or the United States or a state, province, territory or other political subdivision thereof). This covenant shall survive the Effective Time. References in this clause to the Canadian Tax Act shall be to the Canadian Tax Act as of the Effective Time and any modifications thereof which are consistent with the general principle thereof. 

  

 SECTION 7.02 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Section 6.05), each party will use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents necessary to consummate the Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Bowater with such information and documents as is required in connection with
such application.

 ARRANGEMENT 

   

2.1 Binding Effect 

   

 This Plan of Arrangement, within the meaning of section 192 of the CBCA, will become effective at, and be binding at and after, the Effective Time on (i) ACI, (ii) Parent, Bowater, CallCo and ExchangeCo, (iii) all holders and all beneficial owners of ACI Common Shares, (iv) all holders and all beneficial owners of Exchangeable Shares and Parent Options from time to time, (v) all holders of ACI Stock Options and ACI Share-Based Awards and (vi) all holders and beneficial owners of Parent Common Stock received in exchange for Exchangeable Shares or on the exercise of Parent Options. 

  

2.2 Arrangement 

   

 Commencing at the Effective Time, the following shall occur and shall be deemed to occur in the following order without any further act or formality: 

  

       | (a)  |   | each Parent Elected Share will be transferred by
the holder thereof to Parent in exchange for the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the ACI Exchange Ratio, and such transfer shall be
reflected in the register of holders of ACI Common Shares and to the register
of holders of Parent Common Stock accordingly;  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (b)  |   | each Exchangeable Elected Share will be
transferred by the holder thereof to ExchangeCo in exchange for the number of
Exchangeable Shares equal to the ACI Exchange Ratio, and such transfer shall
be reflected in the register of holders of ACI Common Shares and to
the register of holders of Exchangeable Shares accordingly;  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (c)  |   | each ACI Stock Option shall be exchanged with
Parent for an option (a "Parent Option") to purchase a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the ACI Exchange Ratio multiplied
by the number of ACI Common Shares subject to such ACI Stock Option. Such
Parent Option shall provide for an exercise price per share of Parent
Common Stock equal to the exercise price per share of such ACI Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the ACI Exchange Ratio. If
the foregoing calculation results in a Parent Option of a particular holder
being exercisable for a total number of shares of Parent Common Stock that
includes a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, then the total number
of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Parent Option shall
be rounded to the nearest whole number of Parent Common Stock and the total
exercise price for the Parent Option will be appropriately adjusted by the
exercise price of the fractional share of Parent Common Stock. The term to
expiry, conditions to and manner of exercising, and all other terms and
conditions of a Parent Option will otherwise be unchanged, and any document
or agreement previously evidencing an ACI Stock Option shall thereafter
evidence and be deemed to evidence such Parent Option;  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (d)  |   | At the Effective Time, each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to receive ACI Common Shares or benefits measured by
the value of a number of ACI Common Shares, and each award of any kind
consisting of ACI Common Shares, granted under the employee and
director stock plans of ACI (the "ACI Stock Plans") (including restricted
stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units and dividend
equivalents), other than ACI Stock Options (each, an "ACI Share-Based
Award"), whether vested or unvested, which is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right or award with respect
to ACI Common Shares and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a
right or award with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock (a "Parent
Stock-Based Award"), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under ACI Share-Based Awards (but taking into account any changes thereto,
including the acceleration thereof, provided for in ACI Stock Plans, in any
award agreement or in such ACI Share-Based Award by reason of this Plan of
Arrangement or the transactions contemplated hereby). The number of shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to each such Parent Stock-Based Award shall be
equal to the number of ACI Common Shares subject to ACI Share-Based Awards,
multiplied by the ACI Exchange Ratio (with the resulting product rounded to
the nearest whole share). All dividend equivalents credited to the account of
each holder of a ACI Share-Based Award as of the Effective Time shall remain
credited to such holderÂ’s account immediately following the Effective Time,
subject to adjustment in accordance with the foregoing;  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (e)  |   | As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deliver to the holders of ACI Stock Options and ACI Share-Based
Awards appropriate notices setting forth such holdersÂ’ rights pursuant to the
respective ACI Stock Plans and agreements evidencing the grants of such ACI
Stock Options and ACI Share-Based Awards, and stating that such ACI Stock
Options and ACI Share-Based Awards and agreements have been assumed by Parent
and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this Section 2.2 after giving effect to the
Arrangement and the terms of ACI Stock Plans); and  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (f)  |   | Prior to the Effective Time, ACI shall take all
necessary action for the adjustment of ACI Share-Based Awards under this
Section 2.2. Parent shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
that will be subject to Parent Options and Parent Stock-Based Awards as a
result of the actions contemplated by this Plan of Arrangement.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

2.3 Elections 

   

       | (a)  |   | Each person who, at or prior to the Election
Deadline, is a holder of record of ACI Common Shares and who is neither a
Non-Resident of Canada nor a Tax Exempt Shareholder, will be entitled, with
respect to all or a portion of such shares, to make an election at or prior
to the Election Deadline to receive (i) Exchangeable Shares or (ii) shares
of Parent Common Stock, in exchange for such holderÂ’s ACI Common Shares, on
the basis set forth herein and in accordance with such arrangements and
procedures as will be agreed upon in good faith by Parent, Bowater, Merger
Sub, CallCo, ExchangeCo and ACI, including the form of the Letter of
Transmittal and Election Form containing the elections and the procedures
governing transmittal.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (b)  |   | Each ACI Common Share held by a holder who is
either a Non-Resident of Canada or a Tax Exempt Shareholder or in respect of
which an effective election pursuant to Section 2.3(a) has not been made
(other than ACI Common Shares held by Dissenting Shareholders who
are ultimately entitled to be paid the fair value of the ACI Common Shares
held by them) will be deemed to be a Parent Elected Share and will receive
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the total
number of ACI Common Shares held by that holder multiplied by the ACI
Exchange Ratio on the basis set forth herein.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

2.4 Adjustments to ACI Exchange Ratio 

   

 The ACI Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or ACI Common Shares other than stock dividends paid in lieu of ordinary course dividends), consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other like change that affects all outstanding Parent Common Stock, Bowater Common Stock or ACI Common Shares occurring after the date of the Combination Agreement and prior to the Effective Time. 

  

ARTICLE 3 
 RIGHTS OF DISSENT

Holders of ACI Common Shares who duly exercise such rights of dissent and who: 

  

       | (a)  |   | are ultimately determined to be entitled to be

Common Stock equal to the number of ACI Common Shares held by the
holder multiplied by the ACI Exchange Ratio;  
---|---|---|---

person be required to recognize such

 The shares of Parent Common Stock and Exchangeable Shares issued upon conversion of the ACI Common Shares in accordance with the terms hereof and the payment of such dividends or other distributions as are payable pursuant to Section 4.3 and such cash in lieu of any fractional shares as is payable pursuant to Section 4.6 hereof upon the surrender of Share Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article 4 shall be deemed to have been in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the ACI Common Shares formerly represented by such Share Certificates, subject, however, to AlphaÂ’s obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by ACI on the ACI Common Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the share transfer books of ACI shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of ACI of the ACI Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Share Certificate is presented to ACI for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery thereof and exchanged as provided in this Article 4. 

  

4.6 No Fractional Shares 

   

 No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or Exchangeable Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Share Certificates, no dividends or other distributions of Parent or ExchangeCo shall relate to such fractional share interests and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Parent or ExchangeCo. 

  

 As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (x) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof over (y) the aggregate number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to holders of ACI Common Shares pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof (such excess being herein called the "Excess Parent Shares"). Following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of ACI Common Shares, shall sell the Excess Parent Shares at then prevailing prices on the NYSE, all in the manner provided in this Section 4.6 hereof. 

  

 The sale of the Excess Parent Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more 

   ##### 

  

    

member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent
practicable. The Exchange Agent shall use all reasonable efforts to complete
the sale of the Excess Parent Shares as promptly following the Effective Time
as, in the Exchange AgentÂ’s reasonable judgment, is practicable and
consistent with obtaining the best execution of such sales in light of
prevailing market conditions. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have
been distributed to the former holders of ACI Common Shares, the Exchange
Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of ACI Common Shares
(the "Excess Parent Shares Trust"). Parent shall pay all
commissions, transfer taxes and other out of pocket transaction costs,
including the expenses and compensation, of the Exchange Agent incurred in
connection with such sale of the Excess Parent Shares. The Exchange Agent
shall determine the portion of the Excess Parent Shares Trust to which each
holder of ACI Common Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the
amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Excess Parent Shares Trust by
a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share
interest to which such holder of ACI Common Shares is entitled (after taking
into account all ACI Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder
which were exchanged for shares of Parent Common Stock) and the denominator
of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all
holders of ACI Common Shares who exchanged such shares for shares of Parent
Common Stock are entitled. 

  

 As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (x) the number of whole Exchangeable Shares delivered to the Exchange Agent by ExchangeCo pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof over (y) the aggregate number of whole Exchangeable Shares to be distributed to holders of ACI Common Shares pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof (such excess being herein called the "Excess Exchangeable Shares"). Following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of ACI Common Shares, shall sell the Excess Exchangeable Shares all in the manner provided in this Section 4.6. 

  

 The sale of the Excess Exchangeable Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed by private sale (or by way of sale through the facilities of the TSX). The Exchange Agent shall use all reasonable efforts to complete the sale of the Excess Exchangeable Shares as promptly following the Effective Time as, in the Exchange AgentÂ’s reasonable judgment, is practicable and consistent with obtaining the best execution of such sales in light of prevailing market conditions. Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the former holders of ACI Common Shares, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for the holders of ACI Common Shares (the "Excess Exchangeable Shares Trust"). ExchangeCo shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out of pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation, of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale of the Excess Exchangeable Shares. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the Excess Exchangeable Shares Trust to which each holder of ACI Common Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate proceeds comprising the Excess Exchangeable Shares Trust by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of ACI Common Shares is entitled (after taking into account all ACI Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder which were exchanged for Exchangeable Shares) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests to which all holders of ACI Common Shares who exchanged such shares for Exchangeable Shares are entitled. 

  

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, ExchangeCo or Parent, respectively, shall be entitled to deposit cash with the Exchange Agent to enable the Exchange Agent to make cash payments provided for in this Section 4.6, in which case the Exchangeable Shares or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, that would otherwise be sold by the Exchange Agent will be surrendered to ExchangeCo or Parent or no such shares will be issued. 

  

4.7 Termination of the ACI Exchange Fund 

   

 Any portion of the ACI Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Share Certificates for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent and ExchangeCo, pro rata in the proportion of undistributed Parent Elected Shares to ExchangeCo Elected Shares, upon demand, and any holders of the Share Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article 4 shall thereafter look only to Parent and ExchangeCo for, and Parent and ExchangeCo shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for shares of Parent Common Stock, Exchangeable Shares, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 4.6 hereof in accordance with this Article 4. 

  

4.8 No Liability 

   

 None of Parent, ExchangeCo, CallCo, ACI or Bowater, or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock, Exchangeable Shares, dividends or other distributions from the ACI Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Share 

   ##### 

  

    

Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to three years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares
of Parent Common Stock or Exchangeable Shares (and any dividends or other
distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable with respect thereto pursuant
to Section 4.6 hereof) would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Authority), any such shares (and any dividends or other
distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable with respect thereto pursuant
to Section 4.6 hereof) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent or ExchangeCo as the case may be, free and
clear of all claims, rights, interest or liens of any person previously
entitled thereto. 

  

4.9 Investment of ACI Exchange Fund 

   

 The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the ACI Exchange Fund as directed by Parent and ExchangeCo, in proportion to the amounts represented by the Parent Elected Shares to the ExchangeCo Elected Shares. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to and be income of Parent and ExchangeCo, respectively. If for any reason (including losses on any investments) the cash in the ACI Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent and ExchangeCo shall promptly deposit cash into the ACI Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations, pro rata in the proportion of Parent Elected Shares to ExchangeCo Elected Shares . 

  

4.10 Lost Share Certificates 

   

 If any Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or ExchangeCo, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or ExchangeCo may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Share Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Share Certificate shares of Parent Common Stock, Exchangeable Shares any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 4.6 hereof, in each case pursuant to this Article 4. 

  

4.11 Withholding Rights 

   

 Parent, ACI, ExchangeCo, or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Arrangement such amounts as Parent, ACI, ExchangeCo or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of federal, provincial or state or local or other Law of any applicable country or jurisdiction. To the extent that amounts are so deducted, withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by Parent, ACI, ExchangeCo or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Plan of Arrangement as having been paid to the holder of Share Certificates in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, ExchangeCo or the Exchange Agent. 

  

ARTICLE 5 
 CERTAIN RIGHTS OF CALLCO TO ACQUIRE EXCHANGEABLE SHARES 

   

5.1 CallCo Call Rights 

   

 By virtue of this Plan of Arrangement and the Exchangeable Share Provisions, each holder of ACI Common Shares who receives Exchangeable Shares under this Plan of Arrangement, and the assignees from time to time of such Exchangeable Shares, shall be subject to the Liquidation Call Right and the Redemption Call Right of CallCo as referred to in the Exchangeable Share Provisions and, for the purposes of this Plan of Arrangement, set out in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 hereof. Capitalized terms used in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 hereof and not otherwise defined in this Plan of Arrangement shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in the Exchangeable Share Provisions. In addition, such holders and their assignees as aforesaid shall be subject to all other rights of CallCo contained in the Exchangeable Share Provisions, including, without limitation, the Retraction Call Right (as defined in the Exchangeable Share Provisions). 

   ##### 

  

  

5.2 CallCo Liquidation Call Right 

   

       | (a)  |   | CallCo shall have the overriding right (the
"Liquidation Call Right"), in the event of and notwithstanding the proposed
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of ExchangeCo pursuant to Article 5 of
the Exchangeable Share Provisions, to purchase from all but not less than all
of the holders of Exchangeable Shares on the Liquidation Date all but
not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by each such holder on
payment by CallCo of an amount per share equal to (i) the Current Market
Price (as defined in the Exchangeable Share Provisions) of a share of Parent
Common Stock on the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date, which
shall be satisfied in full by causing to be delivered to such holder one
share of Parent Common Stock, plus (ii) the right to receive the full
amount when paid of all unpaid dividends on such Exchangeable Share for which
the record date has occurred prior to the Liquidation Date (collectively, the
"Liquidation Call Purchase Price"). In the event of the exercise of the
Liquidation Call Right by CallCo, each holder shall be obligated to sell all
the Exchangeable Shares held by the holder to CallCo on the Liquidation Date
on payment by CallCo to the holder of the Liquidation Call Purchase Price for
each such share.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (b)  |   | To exercise the Liquidation Call Right, CallCo
must notify ExchangeCo and ExchangeCoÂ’s transfer agent (the "Transfer
Agent"), as agent for the holders of Exchangeable Shares, of CallCoÂ’s
intention to exercise such right at least 45 days before the Liquidation Date
in the case of a voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of
ExchangeCo and at least five Business Days before the Liquidation Date in the
case of an involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of ExchangeCo.
The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of Exchangeable Shares as to
whether or not CallCo has exercised the Liquidation Call Right forthwith
after the expiry of the period during which the same may be exercised by
CallCo. If CallCo exercises the Liquidation Call Right, then on the
Liquidation Date, CallCo will purchase and the holders will sell all of the
Exchangeable Shares then outstanding for a price per share equal to the
Liquidation Call Purchase Price.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (c)  |   | For the purposes of completing the purchase of
the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the Liquidation Call Right, CallCo shall
deposit with the Transfer Agent, on or before the Liquidation Date,
certificates representing the aggregate number of shares of Parent
Common Stock deliverable by CallCo in payment of the total Liquidation Call
Purchase Price and shall waive any rights to receive any dividends which
represent the amount of the remaining portion, if any, of the total
Liquidation Call Purchase Price, less any amounts withheld pursuant to
Section 4.11 hereof. Provided that CallCo has complied with the
immediately preceding sentence, on and after the Liquidation Date, the rights
of each holder of Exchangeable Shares will be limited to receiving such
holderÂ’s proportionate part of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price
payable by CallCo (which, in the case of unpaid dividends, if any, shall be
satisfied by the payment thereof by ExchangeCo on the payment date for such
dividends) upon presentation and surrender by the holder of
certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the
holder shall on and after the Liquidation Date be considered and deemed for
all purposes to be the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock to which
it is entitled. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or
certificates representing Exchangeable Shares, together with such
other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of
Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA and the by-laws of ExchangeCo and such
additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably
require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf of
CallCo shall deliver to such holder, certificates representing the shares
of Parent Common Stock to which the holder is entitled and on the applicable
dividend payment date a cheque or cheques payable at par at any branch of the
bankers of ExchangeCo in Canada in payment of the remaining portion, if any,
of the total Liquidation Call Purchase Price less any amounts withheld
pursuant to Section 4.11 hereof. If CallCo does not exercise the Liquidation
Call Right in the manner described above, on the Liquidation Date the holders
of the Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the liquidation price otherwise payable by ExchangeCo in connection with the
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of ExchangeCo pursuant to Article 5 of
the Exchangeable Share Provisions.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

5.3 CallCo Redemption Call Right 

   

       | (a)  |   | CallCo shall have the overriding right (the
"Redemption Call Right"), notwithstanding the proposed redemption of the
Exchangeable Shares by ExchangeCo pursuant to Article 7 of the Exchangeable
Share Provisions, to purchase from all but not less than all of the holders
of Exchangeable Shares on the Redemption Date all but not less than all of
the Exchangeable Shares held by each such holder on payment by CallCo to the
holder of an  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | amount per share equal to (i) the Current Market Price
(as defined in the Exchangeable Share Provisions) of a share of Parent Common
Stock on the last Business Day prior to the Redemption Date, which shall be
satisfied in full by causing to be delivered to such holder one share of
Parent Common Stock plus (ii) the right to receive the full amount when paid
of all unpaid dividends on such Exchangeable Share for which the record date
has occurred prior to the Redemption Date (collectively, the "Redemption Call
Purchase Price"). In the event of the exercise of the Redemption Call Right
by CallCo, each holder shall be obligated to sell all the Exchangeable Shares
held by the holder to CallCo on the Redemption Date on payment by CallCo to
the holder of the Redemption Call Purchase Price for each such share.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (b)  |   | To exercise the Redemption Call Right, CallCo
must notify the Transfer Agent, as agent for the holders of Exchangeable
Shares, and ExchangeCo of CallCoÂ’s intention to exercise such right at least
60 days before the Redemption Date, except in the case of a
redemption occurring as a result of an acquisition of Control of Parent (as
defined in the Exchangeable Share Provisions) in which case CallCo shall
notify the Transfer Agent and ExchangeCo on or before the Redemption Date.
The Transfer Agent will notify the holders of the Exchangeable Shares as to
whether or not CallCo has exercised the Redemption Call Right forthwith after
the expiry of the period during which the same may be exercised by CallCo. If
CallCo exercises the Redemption Call Right, on the Redemption Date CallCo will
purchase and the holders will sell all of the Exchangeable Shares then
outstanding for a price per share equal to the Redemption Call Purchase
Price.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (c)  |   | For the purposes of completing the purchase of
the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the Redemption Call Right, CallCo shall
deposit with the Transfer Agent, on or before the Redemption Date,
certificates representing the aggregate number of shares of Parent
Common Stock deliverable by CallCo in payment of the total Redemption Call
Purchase Price and shall waive any rights to receive any dividends which
represent the amount of the remaining portion, if any, of the total
Redemption Call Purchase Price less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section
4.11 hereof. Provided that CallCo has complied with the immediately preceding
sentence, on and after the Redemption Date the rights of each holder
of Exchangeable Shares will be limited to receiving such holderÂ’s
proportionate part of the total Redemption Call Purchase Price payable by
CallCo (which in case of unpaid dividends, if any, shall be satisfied by the
payment thereof by ExchangeCo on the payment date for such dividends) upon
presentation and surrender by the holder of certificates representing the
Exchangeable Shares held by such holder and the holder shall on and after
the Redemption Date be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the
holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock to which it is entitled. Upon
surrender to the Transfer Agent of a certificate or certificates representing
Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as
may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA
and the by-laws of ExchangeCo and such additional documents and
instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such
surrendered certificate or certificates shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, and the Transfer Agent on behalf of CallCo shall deliver
to such holder, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock
to which the holder is entitled and on the applicable dividend payment date a
cheque or cheques payable at par at any branch of the bankers of ExchangeCo
in Canada in payment of the remaining portion, if any, of the total
Redemption Call Purchase Price less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section
4.11 hereof. If CallCo does not exercise the Redemption Call Right in the
manner described above, on the Redemption Date the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the redemption price otherwise payable by ExchangeCo in connection with the
redemption of the Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Article 7 of the
Exchangeable Share Provisions.

distribution; 

  



  

  (b) promptly, upon the earlier of receipt by Bowater Canada  of notice of
and Bowater Canada otherwise becoming aware of any  threatened or instituted
claim, suit, petition or other  proceedings with respect to the involuntary
liquidation,  dissolution or  winding-up  of Bowater Canada or to effect
any other distribution of the  assets of Bowater Canada among its
shareholders for the purpose  of winding up its affairs; 

  



  

  (c) immediately, upon receipt by Bowater Canada of a  Retraction
Request; 

  



  

  (d) except in the case of an acquisition of Control of  Bowater, at least
75 days prior to any Redemption Date  determined in accordance with the Share
Provisions; and 

  



  

  (e) as soon as practicable upon the issuance by Bowater  Canada of any
Exchangeable Shares or rights to acquire  Exchangeable Shares (other than the
issuance of Exchangeable  Shares upon (i) the acquisition of outstanding
Avenor  common shares pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement and  (ii) upon
conversion of the 7.50% convertible  debentures of Avenor issued February 8,
1994). 

  



  

  2.5 _Delivery of Common Shares to Bowater  Canada._ In furtherance of its
obligations under  sections 2.1 (d) hereof, upon notice from Bowater  Canada
of any event that requires Bowater Canada to cause to be  delivered Bowater
Common Shares to any holder of Exchangeable  Shares, Bowater shall forthwith
issue and deliver to Bowater  Canada the requisite number of Bowater Common
Shares to be  received by, and issued to or to the order of, the former
holder  of the surrendered Exchangeable Shares, as Bowater Canada shall 
direct. All such Bowater Common Shares shall be duly authorized  and validly
issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be  free and clear of any
lien, claim or encumbrance. In  consideration of the issuance and delivery of
each such Bowater  Common Share, Bowater Canada shall issue to Bowater, or
as  Bowater shall direct, common shares of Bowater Canada having  equivalent
value. 

  



  

  2.6 _Qualification of Bowater Common  Shares._ If any Bowater Common
Shares (or other  shares or securities into which Bowater Common Shares may
be  reclassified or changed as contemplated by section 2.7  hereof) to be
issued and delivered hereunder require  registration or qualification with or
approval of or the filing  of any document, including any prospectus or
similar document or  the taking of any proceeding with or the obtaining of
any order,  ruling or consent from any governmental or regulatory authority 
under any Canadian or United States federal, provincial or state  law or
regulation or pursuant to the rules and regulations of  any regulatory
authority or the fulfilment of any other United  States or Canadian legal
requirement before such shares (or such  other shares or securities) may be
issued by Bowater and  delivered by Bowater, Bowater Canada or Bowater
Holdings, at the  direction of Bowater Canada if applicable, to the holder
of  Exchangeable Shares or in order that such shares (or such other  shares
or securities) may be freely traded thereafter (other  than any restrictions
of general application on transfer by  reason of a holder being a "control
person" for  purposes of Canadian provincial securities law or an 
"affiliate" of Bowater for purposes of United States  federal or state
securities law), Bowater will in good faith  expeditiously take all such
actions and do all such things as  are necessary or desirable to cause such
Bowater Common Shares  (or such other shares or securities) to be and remain
duly  registered, qualified or approved under United States  and/or 
Canadian law, as the case may be. Bowater will in good faith  expeditiously
take all such actions and do all such things as  are reasonably necessary or
desirable to cause all Bowater  Common Shares (or such other shares or
securities) to be  delivered hereunder to be listed, quoted or posted for
trading  on all stock exchanges and quotation systems on which 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  outstanding Bowater Common Shares (or such other shares or  securities)
have been listed by Bowater and remain listed and  are quoted or posted for
trading at such time. 

  



  

  2.7 _Economic  Equivalence._ (a) Bowater will not without  prior approval
of Bowater Canada and the prior approval of the  holders of the Exchangeable
Shares given in accordance with  Section 10.2 of the Share Provisions: 

  



  

  (i) issue or distribute Bowater Common Shares (or  securities exchangeable
for or convertible into or carrying  rights to acquire Bowater Common Shares)
to the holders of all  or substantially all of the then outstanding Bowater
Common  Shares by way of stock dividend or other distribution, other  than
an issue of Bowater Common Shares (or securities  exchangeable for or
convertible into or carrying rights to  acquire Bowater Common Shares) to
holders of Bowater Common  Shares who exercise an option to receive dividends
in Bowater  Common Shares (or securities exchangeable for or convertible 
into or carrying rights to acquire Bowater Common Shares) in  lieu of
receiving cash dividends; or 

  



  

  (ii) issue or distribute rights, options or warrants to the  holders of
all or substantially all of the then outstanding  Bowater Common Shares
entitling them to subscribe for or to  purchase Bowater Common Shares (or
securities exchangeable for  or convertible into or carrying rights to
acquire Bowater Common  Shares); or 

  



  

  (iii) issue or distribute to the holders of all or  substantially all of
the then outstanding Bowater Common Shares  (A) shares or securities of
Bowater of any class other than  Bowater Common Shares (other than shares
convertible into or  exchangeable for or carrying rights to acquire Bowater
Common  Shares), (B) rights, options or warrants other than those  referred
to in section 2.7(a) (ii) above,  (C) evidences of indebtedness of Bowater or
(D) assets  of Bowater, 

  



  

  unless the economic equivalent on a per share basis of such  rights,
options, securities, shares, evidences of indebtedness  or other assets is
issued or distributed simultaneously to  holders of the Exchangeable Shares;
provided that, for greater  certainty, the above restrictions shall not apply
to any  securities issued or distributed by Bowater in order to give  effect
to and to consummate the transactions contemplated by,  and in accordance
with, the Arrangement Agreement. 

  



  

  (b) Bowater will not without the prior approval of Bowater  Canada and the
prior approval of the holders of the Exchangeable  Shares given in accordance
with Section 10.2 of the Share  Provisions: 

  



  

  (i) subdivide, redivide or change the then outstanding  Bowater Common
Shares into a greater number of Bowater Common  Shares; or 

  



  

  (ii) reduce, combine, consolidate or change the then  outstanding Bowater
Common Shares into a lesser number of  Bowater Common Shares; or 

  



  

  (iii) reclassify or otherwise change Bowater Common Shares  or effect an
amalgamation, merger, reorganization or other  transaction affecting Bowater
Common Shares, 

  



  

  unless the same or an economically equivalent change shall  simultaneously
be made to, or in the rights of the holders of,  the Exchangeable Shares. 

  



  

  (c) Bowater will ensure that the record date for any event  referred to in
section 2.7 (a) or 2.7 (b) above,  or (if no record date is applicable for
such event) the  effective date for any such event, is not less than 10
days  after the date on which such event is declared or announced by 
Bowater (with contemporaneous notification thereof by Bowater to  Bowater
Canada and Bowater Holdings). 

  



  

  (d) The Board of Directors of Bowater Canada shall  determine, in good
faith and in its sole discretion (with the  assistance of such reputable and
qualified independent financial  advisors  and/or other  experts as the
Board of Directors of Bowater Canada may  require), economic equivalence for
the purposes of any event  referred to in section 2.7(a) or 2.7 (b) above
and  each such determination shall be conclusive and binding on  Bowater. In
making each such determination, the following  factors shall, without
excluding other factors 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  determined by the Board of Directors of Bowater Canada to be  relevant, be
considered by the Board of Directors of Bowater  Canada: 

  



  

  (i) in the case of any stock dividend or other distribution  payable in
Bowater Common Shares, the number of such shares  issued in proportion to the
number of Bowater Common Shares  previously outstanding; 

  



  

  (ii) in the case of the issuance or distribution of any  rights, options
or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Bowater  Common Shares (or
securities exchangeable for or convertible  into or carrying rights to
acquire Bowater Common Shares), the  relationship between the exercise price
of each such right,  option or warrant and the current market value (as
determined by  the Board of Directors of Bowater Canada in the manner above 
contemplated) of a Bowater Common Share; 

  



  

  (iii) in the case of the issuance or distribution of any  other form of
property (including without limitation any shares  or securities of Bowater
of any class other than Bowater Common  Shares, any rights, options or
warrants other than those  referred to in section 2.7 (d) (ii) above, any 
evidences of indebtedness of Bowater or any assets of Bowater),  the
relationship between the fair market value (as determined by  the Board of
Directors of Bowater Canada in the manner above  contemplated) of such
property to be issued or distributed with  respect to each outstanding
Bowater Common Share and the current  market value (as determined by the
Board of Directors of Bowater  Canada in the manner above contemplated) of a
Bowater Common  Share; 

  



  

  (iv) in the case of any subdivision, redivision or change  of the then
outstanding Bowater Common Shares into a greater  number of Bowater Common
Shares or the reduction, combination,  consolidation or change of the then
outstanding Bowater Common  Shares into a lesser number of Bowater Common
Shares or any  amalgamation, merger, reorganization or other transaction 
affecting Bowater Common Shares, the effect thereof upon the  then
outstanding Bowater Common Shares; and 

  



  

  (v) in all such cases, the general taxation consequences of  the relevant
event to holders of Exchangeable Shares to the  extent that such consequences
may differ from the taxation  consequences to holders of Bowater Common
Shares as a result of  differences between taxation laws of Canada and the
United  States (except for any differing consequences arising as a  result
of differing marginal taxation rates and without regard  to the individual
circumstances of holders of Exchangeable  Shares). 

  



  

  For purposes of the foregoing determinations, the current market  value of
any security listed and traded or quoted on a  securities exchange shall be
the weighted average of the daily  trading prices of such security during a
period of not less than  20 consecutive trading days ending not more than
five trading  days before the date of determination on the principal 
securities exchange on which such securities are listed and  traded or
quoted; provided, however, that if in the opinion of  the Board of Directors
of Bowater Canada the public distribution  or trading activity of such
securities during such period does  not create a market which reflects the
fair market value of such  securities, then the current market value thereof
shall be  determined by the Board of Directors of Bowater Canada, in good 
faith and in its sole discretion (with the assistance of such  reputable and
qualified independent financial advisors  and/or other  experts as the Board
of Directors of Bowater Canada may  require), and provided further that any
such determination by  the Board of Directors of Bowater Canada shall be
conclusive and  binding on Bowater. 

  



  

  (e) Bowater Canada agrees that, to the extent required,  upon due notice
from Bowater, it will use its best efforts to  take or cause to be taken such
steps as may be necessary for the  purposes of ensuring that appropriate
dividends are paid or  other distributions are made by Bowater Canada, or
subdivisions,  redivisions or changes are made to the Exchangeable Shares,
in  order to implement the required economic equivalent with respect  to the
Bowater Common Shares and Exchangeable Shares as provided  for in this
section 2.7. 

  



  

  2.8 _Tender Offers._ In the event  that a tender offer, share exchange
offer, issuer bid, take-over  bid or similar transaction with respect to
Bowater Common Shares  (an "Offer") is proposed by Bowater or is proposed
to  Bowater or its shareholders and is recommended by the Board of 
Directors of Bowater, or is otherwise effected or to be effected  with the
consent or approval of the Board of Directors of  Bowater, Bowater will use
its reasonable efforts expeditiously  and in good faith to take all such
actions and do all such 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  things as are necessary or desirable to enable and permit  holders of
Exchangeable Shares to participate in such Offer to  the same extent and on
an economically equivalent basis as the  holders of Bowater Common Shares,
without discrimination.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Bowater will  use its reasonable efforts expeditiously and in good faith to 
ensure that holders of Exchangeable Shares may participate in  all such
Offers without being required to retract Exchangeable  Shares as against
Bowater Canada (or, if so required, to ensure  that any such retraction shall
be effective only upon, and shall  be conditional upon, the closing of the
Offer and only to the  extent necessary to tender or deposit to the Offer).
Nothing  herein shall affect the rights of Bowater Canada to redeem or 
Bowater Holdings to purchase Exchangeable Shares, as applicable,  in the
event of an acquisition of Control of Bowater. 

  



  

  2.9 _Ownership of Outstanding  Shares._ Without the prior approval of
Bowater  Canada and the prior approval of the holders of the Exchangeable 
Shares given in accordance with Section 10.2 of the Share  Provisions,
Bowater covenants and agrees in favour of Bowater  Canada that, as long as
any outstanding Exchangeable Shares are  owned by any person or entity other
than Bowater or any of its  Affiliates, Bowater will be and remain the direct
or indirect  beneficial owner of all issued and outstanding voting shares
in  the capital of Bowater Canada and Bowater Holdings. 

  



  

  2.10 _Bowater and Affiliates Not to  Vote Exchangeable Shares._ Each of
Bowater  and Bowater Holdings covenants and agrees that it will appoint  and
cause to be appointed proxyholders with respect to all  Exchangeable Shares
held by it and its Affiliates for the sole  purpose of attending each meeting
of holders of Exchangeable  Shares in order to be counted as part of the
quorum for each  such meeting. Each of Bowater and Bowater Holdings further 
covenants and agrees that it will not, and will cause its  Affiliates not to,
exercise any voting rights which may be  exercisable by holders of
Exchangeable Shares from time to time  pursuant to the Share Provisions or
pursuant to the provisions  of the _Canada Business Corporations Act_ (or any
successor  or other corporate statute by which Bowater Canada may in the 
future be governed) with respect to any Exchangeable Shares held  by it or by
its Affiliates in respect of any matter considered  at any meeting of holders
of Exchangeable Shares. 

  



  

  2.11 _Rule 10b-18  Purchases._ For certainty, nothing contained in  this
Agreement, including without limitation the obligations of  Bowater contained
in Section 2.8 hereof, shall limit the  ability of Bowater, Bowater Holdings
or Bowater Canada to make a  "Rule 10b-18  Purchase" of Bowater Common
Shares pursuant to  Rule 10b-18  of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, or  any successor provisions thereof.

including the right to  vote in person or by proxy the Bowater Special Voting
Share on  any matters, questions, proposals or propositions whatsoever  that
may properly come before the holders of Bowater Common  Shares at a Bowater
Meeting (as hereinafter defined). The Voting  Rights shall be and remain

would otherwise be  entitled, the Trustee will not have Voting Rights with
respect  to such Beneficiary Votes. 

  



  

  4.2 _Number of Votes._ With respect  to all meetings of shareholders of
Bowater at which holders of  Bowater Common Shares are entitled to vote (each
a "Bowater  Meeting"), each Beneficiary shall be entitled to instruct  the
Trustee to cast and exercise one of the votes comprised in  the Voting Rights
for each Exchangeable Share owned of record by  such Beneficiary on the
record date established by Bowater or by  applicable law for such Bowater
Meeting (the "Beneficiary  Votes"), in respect of each matter, question,
proposal or  proposition to be voted on at such Bowater Meeting. 

  



  

  4.3 _Mailings to Shareholders._ With  respect to each Bowater Meeting, the
Trustee will mail or cause  to be mailed (or otherwise communicate in the
same manner as  Bowater utilizes in communications to holders of Bowater
Common  Shares) to each of the Beneficiaries named in the List referred  to
in section 4.6, such mailing or communication to  commence on the same day as
the commencement of the initial  mailing or notice (or other communication)
with respect thereto  is given by Bowater to its shareholders: 

  



  

  (a) a copy of such notice, together with any related  materials to be
provided to shareholders of Bowater; 

  



  

  (b) a statement that such Beneficiary is entitled to  instruct the Trustee
as to the exercise of the Beneficiary Votes  with respect to such Bowater
Meeting or, pursuant to  section 4.7, to attend such Bowater Meeting and to
exercise  personally the Beneficiary Votes thereat; 

  



  

  (c) a statement as to the manner in which such instructions  may be given
to the Trustee, including an express indication  that instructions may be
given to the Trustee to give: 

  



  

  (i) a proxy to such Beneficiary or his designee to exercise  personally
the Beneficiary Votes; or 

  



  

  (ii) a proxy to a designated agent or other representative  of the
management of Bowater to exercise such Beneficiary Votes; 

  



  

  (d) a statement that if no such instructions are received  from the

a Bowater Meeting shall  not be earlier than the close of business on the
second Business  Day prior to such meeting, and of the method and deadline
for  revoking or amending such instructions. 

  



  

  For the purpose of determining Beneficiary Votes to which a  Beneficiary
is entitled in respect of any Bowater Meeting, the  number of Exchangeable
Shares owned of record by the Beneficiary  shall be determined at the close
of business on the record date  established by Bowater or by applicable law
for purposes of  determining shareholders entitled to vote at such Bowater 
Meeting. Bowater will notify the Trustee of any decision of the  Board of
Directors of Bowater with respect to the calling of any  Bowater Meeting and
shall 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  provide all necessary information and materials to the Trustee  in each
case promptly and in any event in sufficient time to  enable the Trustee to
perform its obligations contemplated by  this section 4.3. 

  



  

  4.4 _Copies of Shareholder  Information._ Bowater will deliver to the
Trustee  copies of all proxy materials (including notices of Bowater 
Meetings but excluding proxies to vote Bowater Common  Shares), information
statements, reports (including without  limitation, all interim and annual
financial statements) and  other written communications that, in each case,
are to be  distributed from time to time to holders of Bowater Common 
Shares in sufficient quantities and in sufficient time so as to  enable the
Trustee to send those materials to each Beneficiary  at the same time as such
materials are first sent to holders of  Bowater Common Shares. The Trustee
will mail or otherwise send  to each Beneficiary, at the expense of Bowater,
copies of all  such materials (and all materials specifically directed to
the  Beneficiaries or to the Trustee for the benefit of the  Beneficiaries
by Bowater) received by the Trustee from Bowater  contemporaneously with the
sending of such materials to holders  of Bowater Common Shares. The Trustee
will also make available  for inspection by any Beneficiary at the
TrusteeÂ’s  principal corporate trust office in the City of Toronto and in 
the City of Montreal all proxy materials, information  statements, reports
and other written communications that are: 

  



  

  (a) received by the Trustee as the registered holder of the  Bowater
Special Voting Share and made available by Bowater  generally to the holders
of Bowater Common Shares; or 

  



  

  (b) specifically directed to the Beneficiaries or to the  Trustee for the
benefit of the Beneficiaries by Bowater. 

  



  

  4.5 _Other Materials._ Immediately  after receipt by Bowater or
shareholders of Bowater of any  material sent or given by or on behalf of a
third party to  holders of Bowater Common Shares generally, including
without  limitation, dissident proxy and information circulars (and  related
information and material) and tender and exchange offer  circulars (and
related information and material), Bowater shall  use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain and deliver to the  Trustee copies thereof in sufficient
quantities so as to enable  the Trustee to forward such material (unless the
same has been  provided directly to Beneficiaries by such third party) to
each  Beneficiary as soon as possible thereafter. Immediately upon  receipt
thereof, the Trustee will mail or otherwise send to each  Beneficiary, at the
expense of Bowater, copies of all such  materials received by the Trustee
from Bowater. The Trustee will  also make available for inspection by any
Beneficiary at the  TrusteeÂ’s principal corporate trust office in the City
of  Toronto and in the City of Montreal copies of all such  materials. 

  



  

  4.6 _List of Persons Entitled to  Vote._ Bowater Canada shall, (a) prior
to  each annual, general and special Bowater Meeting and  (b) forthwith upon
each request made at any time by the  Trustee in writing, prepare or cause to
be prepared a list (a  "List") of the names and addresses of the 
Beneficiaries arranged in alphabetical order and showing the  number of
Exchangeable Shares held of record by each such  Beneficiary, in each case at
the close of business on the date  specified by the Trustee in such request
or, in the case of a  List prepared in connection with a Bowater Meeting, at
the close  of business on the record date established by Bowater or 
pursuant to applicable law for determining the holders of  Bowater Common
Shares entitled to receive notice of  and/or to  vote at such Bowater
Meeting. Each such List shall be delivered  to the Trustee promptly after
receipt by Bowater Canada of such  request or the record date for such
meeting. Bowater agrees to  give Bowater Canada notice (with a copy to the
Trustee) of the  calling of any Bowater Meeting, together with the record
date  therefor, sufficiently prior to the date of the calling of such 
meeting so as to enable Bowater Canada to perform its  obligations under this
section 4.6. 

  



  

  4.7 _Entitlement to Direct  Votes._ Any Beneficiary named in a List
prepared  in connection with any Bowater Meeting will be entitled  (a) to
instruct the Trustee in the manner described in  section 4.3 with respect to
the exercise of the Beneficiary  Votes to which such Beneficiary is entitled
or (b) to  attend such meeting and personally to exercise thereat, as the 
proxy of the Trustee, the Beneficiary Votes to which such  Beneficiary is
entitled.

Meeting._ (a) In connection  with each Bowater Meeting, the Trustee shall

as to which such Beneficiary is entitled to direct the  vote (or any lesser
number thereof as may be set forth in the  instructions); 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  provided, however, that such written instructions are received  by the
Trustee from the Beneficiary prior to the time and date  fixed by it for
receipt of such instruction in the notice given  by the Trustee to the
Beneficiary pursuant to section 4.3. 

  



  

  (b) The Trustee shall cause a representative who is  empowered by it to
sign and deliver, on behalf of the Trustee,  proxies for Voting Rights to
attend each Bowater Meeting. Upon  submission by a Beneficiary (or its
designee) of identification  satisfactory to the TrusteeÂ’s representative,
and at the  BeneficiaryÂ’s request, such representative shall sign and 
deliver to such Beneficiary (or its designee) a proxy to  exercise personally
the Beneficiary Votes as to which such  Beneficiary is otherwise entitled
hereunder to direct the vote,  if such Beneficiary either (i) has not
previously given the  Trustee instructions pursuant to section 4.3 in respect
of  such meeting or (ii) submits to such representative written  revocation
of any such previous instructions. At such meeting,  the Beneficiary
exercising such Beneficiary Votes shall have the  same rights as the Trustee
to speak at the meeting in favour of  any matter, question, proposal or
proposition, to exercise  Voting Rights equal in number to the Beneficiary
Votes to which  such Beneficiary is entitled by way of ballot at the meeting
in  respect of any matter, question, proposal or proposition, and to

basis and  without charge or other expense:

with  respect to the Beneficiary Votes exercisable in respect of the 
Exchangeable Shares held by such Beneficiary, including the  right to
instruct the Trustee as to the exercise of or to  exercise personally
corresponding Voting Rights, shall be deemed  to be surrendered by the

represented thereby  shall cease immediately upon the delivery by such holder
to the  Trustee of the certificates representing such Exchangeable  Shares

  agreement, the Trustee shall possess and be vested with full  legal
ownership of the Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange  Rights and shall

certificate representing Exchangeable Shares to bear an  appropriate legend

remain  vested in and exercised by the Trustee. Subject to  section 7.15,

instructions received pursuant to this  Article 5 from Beneficiaries entitled
to instruct the  Trustee as to the exercise thereof. To the extent that no 
instructions are received from a Beneficiary with respect to the  Exchange
Right, the Trustee shall not exercise or permit the  exercise of the Exchange
Right. 

  



  

  5.4 _Purchase Price._ The purchase  price payable by Bowater for each
Exchangeable Share to be  purchased by Bowater under the Exchange Right shall
be an amount  per share equal to (a) the Current Market Price of a  Bowater

to the Trustee, on behalf  of the relevant Beneficiary, one Bowater Common
Share and on the  applicable payment date a cheque for the balance, if any,
of the  purchase price without interest (but less any amounts withheld

  5.5 _Exercise Instructions._ Subject  to the terms and conditions herein
set forth, a Beneficiary  shall be entitled, upon the occurrence and during
the  continuance of an Insolvency Event, to instruct the Trustee to 
exercise the Exchange Right with respect to all or any part of  the
Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of such  Beneficiary on the books

Trustee, the Beneficiary  shall deliver to the Trustee, in person or by
certified or  registered mail, at its principal corporate trust office in 
Toronto, Ontario or Montreal, Quebec or at such other  places in Canada as
the Trustee may from time to time designate  by written notice to the
Beneficiaries, the certificates  representing the Exchangeable Shares which
such Beneficiary  desires Bowater to purchase, duly endorsed in blank for 
transfer, and accompanied by such other documents and  instruments as may be
required to effect a transfer of  Exchangeable Shares under the _Canada
Business Corporations  Act_ and the by-laws of Bowater Canada and such
additional  documents and instruments as the Trustee may reasonably require 
together with (a) a duly completed form of notice of  exercise of the
Exchange Right, contained on the reverse of or  attached to the Exchangeable
Share certificates, stating  (i) that the Beneficiary thereby instructs the
Trustee to  exercise the Exchange Right so as to require Bowater to
purchase  from the Beneficiary the number of Exchangeable Shares specified 
therein, (ii) that such Beneficiary has good title to and  owns all such
Exchangeable Shares to be acquired by Bowater free  and clear of all liens,
claims and encumbrances, (iii) the  names in which the certificates
representing Bowater Common  Shares issuable in connection with the exercise
of the Exchange  Right are to be issued and (iv) the names and addresses of 
the persons to whom such new certificates should 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  be delivered and (b) payment (or evidence satisfactory to  the Trustee,
Bowater Canada and Bowater of payment) of the taxes  (if any) payable as
contemplated by section 5.8. If only a  part of the Exchangeable Shares
represented by any certificate  or certificates delivered to the Trustee are
to be purchased by  Bowater under the Exchange Right, a new certificate for
the  balance of such Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to the  holder at
the expense of Bowater Canada. 

  



  

  5.6 _Delivery of Bowater Common Shares: Effect of  Exercise._ Promptly
after receipt of the  certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares which
the  Beneficiary desires Bowater to purchase under the Exchange  Right,
together with such documents and instruments of transfer  and a duly
completed form of notice of exercise of the Exchange  Right (and payment of
taxes, if any, payable as contemplated by  section 5.8 or evidence thereof),
duly endorsed for  transfer to Bowater, the Trustee shall notify Bowater
and  Bowater Canada of its receipt of the same, which notice to  Bowater and
Bowater Canada shall constitute exercise of the  Exchange Right by the
Trustee on behalf of the holder of such  Exchangeable Shares, and Bowater
shall promptly thereafter  deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee,
for delivery to  such Beneficiary (or to such other persons, if any,
properly  designated by such Beneficiary) the number of Bowater Common 
Shares issuable in connection with the exercise of the Exchange  Right, and
on the applicable payment date cheques for the  balance, if any, of the total
purchase price therefor without  interest (but less any amounts withheld
pursuant to  section 5.13); provided, however, that no such delivery  shall
be made unless and until the Beneficiary requesting the  same shall have paid
(or provided evidence satisfactory to the  Trustee, Bowater Canada and
Bowater of the payment of) the taxes  (if any) payable as contemplated by
section 5.8.  Immediately upon the giving of notice by the Trustee to
Bowater  and Bowater Canada of the exercise of the Exchange Right, as 
provided in this section 5.6, the closing of the  transaction of purchase and
sale contemplated by the Exchange  Right shall be deemed to have occurred and
the holder of such  Exchangeable Shares shall be deemed to have transferred
to  Bowater all of its right, title and interest in and to such 
Exchangeable Shares and the related interest in the  Trust Estate and shall
cease to be a holder of such  Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled
to exercise any of  the rights of a holder in respect thereof, other than the
right  to receive his proportionate part of the total purchase price 
therefor, unless the requisite number of Bowater Common Shares  is not
allotted, issued and delivered by Bowater to the Trustee  within five
Business Days of the date of the giving of such  notice by the Trustee, in
which case the rights of the  Beneficiary shall remain unaffected until such
Bowater Common  Shares are so allotted, issued and delivered by Bowater.
Upon  delivery by Bowater to the Trustee of such Bowater Common  Shares, the
Trustee shall deliver such Bowater Common Shares to  such Beneficiary (or to
such other persons, if any, properly  designated by such Beneficiary).
Concurrently with such  Beneficiary ceasing to be a holder of Exchangeable
Shares, the  Beneficiary shall be considered and deemed for all purposes to 
be the holder of Bowater Common Shares delivered to it pursuant  to the
Exchange Right. 

  



  

  5.7 _Exercise of Exchange Right Subsequent to  Retraction._ In the event
that a Beneficiary has  exercised its right under Article 6 of the Share
Provisions  to require Bowater Canada to redeem any or all of the 
Exchangeable Shares held by the Beneficiary (the "Retracted  Shares") and is
notified by Bowater Canada pursuant to  Section 6.6 of the Share Provisions
that Bowater Canada  will not be permitted as a result of solvency
requirements of  applicable law to redeem all such Retracted Shares, and
provided  that Bowater Holdings shall not have exercised the Retraction 
Call Right with respect to the Retracted Shares and that the  Beneficiary has
not revoked the retraction request delivered by  the Beneficiary to Bowater
Canada pursuant to Section 6.1  of the Share Provisions, the retraction
request will constitute  and will be deemed to constitute notice from the
Beneficiary to  the Trustee instructing the Trustee to exercise the
Exchange  Right with respect to those Retracted Shares that Bowater Canada 
is unable to redeem. In any such event, Bowater Canada hereby  agrees with
the Trustee and in favour of the Beneficiary  promptly to forward or cause to
be forwarded to the Trustee all  relevant materials delivered by the
Beneficiary to Bowater  Canada or to the transfer agent of the Exchangeable
Shares  (including without limitation, a copy of the retraction request 
delivered pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Share Provisions)  in connection
with such proposed redemption of the Retracted  Shares and the Trustee will
thereupon exercise the Exchange  Right with respect to the Retracted Shares
that Bowater Canada  is not permitted to redeem and will require Bowater to
purchase  such shares in accordance with the provisions of this  Article
5.

  5.8 _Stamp or Other Transfer  Taxes._ Upon any sale of Exchangeable Shares
to  Bowater pursuant to the Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange 
Rights, the share certificate or certificates representing  Bowater Common
Shares to be delivered in connection with the  payment of the total purchase
price therefor shall be issued in  the name of such Beneficiary or in such
names as such  Beneficiary may otherwise direct in writing without charge
to  the Beneficiary; provided, however, that such Beneficiary  (a) shall pay
(and none of Bowater, Bowater Holdings,  Bowater Canada or the Trustee shall
be required to pay) any  documentary, stamp, transfer or other taxes that may
be payable  in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery 
of such shares to a person other than such Beneficiary or  (b) shall have
evidenced to the satisfaction of the  Trustee, Bowater, Bowater Holdings and
Bowater Canada that such  taxes, if any, have been paid. 

  



  

  5.9 _Notice of Insolvency Event._ As  soon as practicable following the
occurrence of an Insolvency  Event or any event that with the giving of
notice or the passage  of time or both would be an Insolvency Event, Bowater
Canada and  Bowater shall give written notice thereof to the Trustee. As 
soon as practicable following the receipt of notice from Bowater  Canada and
Bowater of the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, or  upon the Trustee
becoming aware of an Insolvency Event, the  Trustee will mail to each
Beneficiary, at the expense of  Bowater, a notice of such Insolvency Event,
which notice shall  contain a brief statement of the rights of the
Beneficiaries  with respect to the Exchange Right. 

  



  

  5.10 _Qualification of Bowater Common  Shares._ Bowater covenants that if
any Bowater  Common Shares to be issued and delivered pursuant to the 
Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange Rights require  registration or
qualification with or approval of or the filing  of any document, including
any prospectus or similar document,  or the taking of any proceeding with or
the obtaining of any  order, ruling or consent from any governmental or
regulatory  authority under any Canadian or United States federal, 
provincial or state law or regulation or pursuant to the rules  and
regulations of any regulatory authority or the fulfilment of  any other
Canadian or United States legal requirement before  such shares may be issued
and delivered by Bowater to the  initial holder thereof or in order that such
shares may be  freely traded thereafter (other than any restrictions of
general  application on transfer by reason of a holder being a  "control
person" of Bowater for purposes of Canadian  federal or provincial securities
law or an "affiliate"  of Bowater for purposes of United States federal or
state  securities law), Bowater will in good faith expeditiously take  all
such actions and do all such things as are necessary or  desirable to cause
such Bowater Common Shares to be and remain  duly registered, qualified or
approved. Bowater will in good  faith expeditiously take all such actions and
do all such things  as are reasonably necessary or desirable to cause all
Bowater  Common Shares to be delivered pursuant to the Exchange Right or 
the Automatic Exchange Rights to be listed, quoted or posted for  trading on
all stock exchanges and quotation systems on which  outstanding Bowater
Common Shares have been listed by Bowater  and remain listed and are quoted
or posted for trading at such  time. 

  



  

  5.11 _Bowater Common Shares._ Bowater  hereby represents, warrants and
covenants that the Bowater  Common Shares issuable as described herein will
be duly  authorized and validly issued as fully paid and non assessable  and
shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance. 

  



  

  5.12 _Automatic Exchange on Liquidation of  Bowater_ (a) Bowater will give
the Trustee  notice of each of the following events at the time set forth 
below: 

  



  

  (i) in the event of any determination by the Board of  Directors of
Bowater to institute voluntary liquidation,  dissolution or  winding-up 
proceedings with respect to Bowater or to effect any other  distribution of
assets of Bowater among its shareholders for the  purpose of winding up its
affairs, at least 60 days prior  to the proposed effective date of such
liquidation, dissolution,  winding-up  or other distribution; and 

  



  

  (ii) as soon as practicable following the earlier of  (A) receipt by
Bowater of notice of, and (B) Bowater  otherwise becoming aware of, any
threatened or instituted claim,  suit, petition or other proceedings with
respect to the  involuntary liquidation, dissolution or  winding-up  of
Bowater or to effect any other distribution of assets of  Bowater among its
shareholders for the purpose of winding up its  affairs, in each case where
Bowater has failed to contest in  good faith any such proceeding commenced in
respect of Bowater  within 30 days of becoming aware thereof. 

  
 ##### 

  

  



  

  (b) As soon as practicable following receipt by the Trustee  from Bowater
of notice of any event (a "Liquidation  Event") contemplated by section
5.12(a)(i) or  5.12(a)(ii) above, the Trustee will give notice thereof to
the  Beneficiaries. Such notice shall include a brief description of  the
automatic exchange of Exchangeable Shares for Bowater Common  Shares provided
for in section 5.12(c). 

  



  

  (c) In order that the Beneficiaries will be able to  participate on a _pro
rata_ basis with the holders of  Bowater Common Shares in the distribution of
assets of Bowater  in connection with a Liquidation Event, on the fifth
Business  Day prior to the effective date (the "Liquidation Event  Effective
Date") of a Liquidation Event all of the then  outstanding Exchangeable
Shares shall be automatically exchanged  for Bowater Common Shares. To effect
such automatic exchange,  Bowater shall purchase on the fifth Business Day
prior to the  Liquidation Event Effective Date each Exchangeable Share then 
outstanding and held by Beneficiaries, and each Beneficiary  shall sell the
Exchangeable Shares held by it at such time, for  a purchase price per share
equal to (a) the Current Market  Price of a Bowater Common Share on the fifth
Business Day prior  to the Liquidation Event Effective Date, which shall be 
satisfied in full by Bowater issuing to the Beneficiary one  Bowater Common
Share, and (b) the right to receive the full  amount when paid of all unpaid
dividends thereon for which the  record date has occurred prior to the date
of the exchange. 

  



  

  (d) On the fifth Business Day prior to the Liquidation  Event Effective
Date, the closing of the transaction of purchase  and sale contemplated by
the automatic exchange of Exchangeable  Shares for Bowater Common Shares
shall be deemed to have  occurred, and each Beneficiary shall be deemed to
have  transferred to Bowater all of the BeneficiaryÂ’s right,  title and
interest in and to such BeneficiaryÂ’s  Exchangeable Shares and the related
interest in the  Trust Estate and shall cease to be a holder of such 
Exchangeable Shares and Bowater shall issue to the Beneficiary  the Bowater
Common Shares issuable upon the automatic exchange  of Exchangeable Shares
for Bowater Common Shares and on the  applicable payment date shall deliver
to the Trustee for  delivery to the Beneficiary a cheque for the balance, if
any, of  the total purchase price for such Exchangeable Shares without 
interest but less any amounts withheld pursuant to  section 5.13.
Concurrently with such Beneficiary ceasing to  be a holder of Exchangeable
Shares, the Beneficiary shall be  considered and deemed for all purposes to
be the holder of the  Bowater Common Shares issued pursuant to the automatic
exchange  of Exchangeable Shares for Bowater Common Shares and the 
certificates held by the Beneficiary previously representing the 
Exchangeable Shares exchanged by the Beneficiary with Bowater  pursuant to
such automatic exchange shall thereafter be deemed  to represent Bowater
Common Shares issued to the Beneficiary by  Bowater pursuant to such
automatic exchange. Upon the request of  a Beneficiary and the surrender by
the Beneficiary of  Exchangeable Share certificates deemed to represent
Bowater  Common Shares, duly endorsed in blank and accompanied by such 
instruments of transfer as Bowater may reasonably require,  Bowater shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to the  Beneficiary certificates
representing Bowater Common Shares of  which the Beneficiary is the holder. 

  



  

  5.13 _Withholding Rights._ Bowater,  Bowater Holdings, Bowater Canada and
the Trustee shall be  entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise  payable under this trust agreement to any holder of Exchangeable 
Shares such amounts as Bowater, Bowater Holdings, Bowater Canada  or the
Trustee is required or permitted to deduct and withhold  with respect to such
payment under the _Income Tax Act _ (Canada), the United States Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 or  any provision of provincial, state, local or foreign
tax law, in  each case as amended or succeeded. To the extent that amounts 
are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all  purposes as
having been paid to the holder of the Exchangeable  Shares in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was  made, provided that such withheld
amounts are actually remitted  to the appropriate taxing authority. To the
extent that the  amount so required or permitted to be deducted or withheld
from  any payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion, if any, of the 
consideration otherwise payable to the holder, Bowater, Bowater  Holdings and
Bowater Canada and the Trustee are hereby  authorized to sell or otherwise
dispose of such portion of the  consideration as is necessary to provide
sufficient funds to  Bowater, Bowater Holdings, Bowater Canada or the
Trustee, as the  case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or 
withholding requirement and Bowater, Bowater Holdings, Bowater  Canada or the
Trustee shall notify the holder thereof and remit  to such holder any
unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such  sale.

time of  the Exchange Right and the Automatic Exchange Rights.

rights  or for the execution of any trust or power hereunder unless the 
Beneficiary has requested the Trustee to take or institute such  action, suit
or proceeding and furnished the Trustee with the  security or indemnity
referred to in section 7.6 and the  Trustee shall have failed to act within a
reasonable time  thereafter. In such case, but not otherwise, the
Beneficiary  shall be entitled to take proceedings in any court of
competent  jurisdiction such as the Trustee might have taken; it being 
understood and intended that no one or more Beneficiaries shall  have any

   INDEMNIFICATION  AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY   

  



  

  9.1 _Indemnification of the  Trustee._ Bowater, Bowater Holdings and
Bowater  Canada jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold  harmless
the Trustee and each of its directors, officers and  agents appointed and
acting in accordance with this trust  agreement (collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties")  against all claims, losses, damages, reasonable
costs,  penalties, fines and reasonable expenses (including reasonable 
expenses of the TrusteeÂ’s legal counsel) which, without  fraud, negligence,
recklessness, wilful misconduct or 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  bad faith on the part of such Indemnified Party, may be paid,  incurred or
suffered by the Indemnified Party by reason of or as  a result of the
TrusteeÂ’s acceptance or administration of  the Trust, its compliance with its
duties set forth in this  trust agreement, or any written or oral instruction
delivered to  the Trustee by Bowater, Bowater Holdings or Bowater Canada 
pursuant hereto. 

  



  

  In no case shall Bowater, Bowater Holdings or Bowater Canada be  liable
under this indemnity for any claim against any of the  Indemnified Parties
unless Bowater, Bowater Holdings and Bowater  Canada shall be notified by the
Trustee of the written assertion  of a claim or of any action commenced
against the Indemnified  Parties, promptly after any of the Indemnified
Parties shall  have received any such written assertion of a claim or shall 
have been served with a summons or other first legal process  giving
information as to the nature and basis of the claim.  Subject to (ii) below,
Bowater, Bowater Holdings and  Bowater Canada shall be entitled to
participate at their own  expense in the defence and, if Bowater, Bowater
Holdings and  Bowater Canada so elect at any time after receipt of such 
notice, any of them may assume the defence of any suit brought  to enforce
any such claim. The Trustee shall have the right to  employ separate counsel
in any such suit and participate in the  defence thereof but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall  be at the expense of the Trustee unless: (i)
the employment  of such counsel has been authorized by Bowater, Bowater
Holdings  or Bowater Canada; or (ii) the named parties to any such  suit
include both the Trustee and Bowater, Bowater Holdings or  Bowater Canada and
the Trustee shall have been advised by  counsel acceptable to Bowater,
Bowater Holdings or Bowater  Canada that there may be one or more legal
defences available to  the Trustee that are different from or in addition to
those  available to Bowater, Bowater Holdings or Bowater Canada and  that,
in the judgment of such counsel, would present a conflict  of interest were a
joint representation to be undertaken (in  which case Bowater, Bowater
Holdings and Bowater Canada shall  not have the right to assume the defence
of such suit on behalf  of the Trustee but shall be liable to pay the
reasonable fees  and expenses of counsel for the Trustee). 

  



  

  9.2 _Limitation of Liability._ The  Trustee shall not be held liable for
any loss which may occur by  reason of depreciation of the value of any part
of the  Trust Estate or any loss incurred on any investment of  funds
pursuant to this trust agreement, except to the extent  that such loss is
attributable to the fraud, negligence,  recklessness, wilful misconduct or
bad faith on the part of the  Trustee.

   CHANGE OF  TRUSTEE   

  



  

  10.1 _Resignation._ The Trustee, or  any trustee hereafter appointed, may
at any time resign by  giving written notice of such resignation to Bowater,
Bowater  Holdings and Bowater Canada specifying the date on which it 
desires to resign, provided that such notice shall not be given  less than
one month before such desired resignation date unless  Bowater, Bowater
Holdings and Bowater Canada otherwise agree and  provided further that such
resignation shall not take effect  until the date of the appointment of a
successor trustee and the  acceptance of such appointment by the successor
trustee. Upon  receiving such notice of resignation, Bowater, Bowater
Holdings  and Bowater Canada shall promptly appoint a successor trustee by 
written instrument in duplicate, one copy of which shall be  delivered to the
resigning trustee and one copy to the successor  trustee. 

  



  

  10.2 _Removal._ The Trustee, or any  trustee hereafter appointed, may
(provided a successor trustee  is appointed) be removed at any time on 30
daysÂ’ prior  notice by written instrument executed by Bowater, Bowater 
Holdings and Bowater Canada, in duplicate, one copy of which  shall be
delivered to the trustee so removed and one copy to the  successor trustee. 

  



  

  10.3 _Successor Trustee._ Any  successor trustee appointed as provided
under this trust  agreement shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to
Bowater,  Bowater Holdings and Bowater Canada and to its predecessor 
trustee an instrument accepting such appointment. Thereupon the  resignation
or removal of the predecessor trustee shall become  effective and such
successor trustee, without any further act,  deed or conveyance, shall become
vested with all the rights,  powers, duties and obligations of its
predecessor under this  trust agreement, with the like effect as if
originally named as  trustee in this trust agreement. However, on the written
request  of Bowater, Bowater Holdings and Bowater Canada or of the 
successor trustee, the trustee ceasing to act shall, 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  upon payment of any amounts then due it pursuant to the  provisions of
this trust agreement, execute and deliver an  instrument transferring to such
successor trustee all the rights  and powers of the trustee so ceasing to
act. Upon the request of  any such successor trustee, Bowater, Bowater
Holdings, Bowater  Canada and such predecessor trustee shall execute any and
all  instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in  and
confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and  powers. 

  



  

  10.4 _Notice of Successor  Trustee._ Upon acceptance of appointment by a 
successor trustee as provided herein, Bowater, Bowater Holdings  and Bowater
Canada shall cause to be mailed notice of the  succession of such trustee
hereunder to each Beneficiary  specified in a List. If Bowater, Bowater
Holdings or Bowater  Canada shall fail to cause such notice to be mailed
within  10 days after acceptance of appointment by the successor  trustee,
the successor trustee shall cause such notice to be  mailed at the expense of
Bowater, Bowater Holdings and Bowater  Canada.

  11.1 _Certain Requirements in Respect of  Combination, Etc._ Bowater shall
not enter into  any transaction (whether by way of reconstruction, 
reorganization, consolidation, merger, transfer, sale, lease or  otherwise)
whereby all or substantially all of its undertaking,  property and assets
would become the property of any other  person or, in the case of a merger,
of the continuing  corporation resulting therefrom unless:

instruments  (if any) as are satisfactory to the Trustee, acting
reasonably,  and in the opinion of legal counsel to the Trustee are

Successor of liability for all moneys payable and  property deliverable
hereunder and the covenant of such Bowater  Successor to pay and deliver or
cause to be delivered the same  and its agreement to observe and perform all
the covenants and  obligations of Bowater under this trust agreement; and

of the  Beneficiaries hereunder.

Canada shall execute and  deliver the supplemental trust agreement provided
for in  Article 12 and thereupon Bowater Successor shall possess  and from
time to time may exercise each and every right and  power of Bowater under
this trust agreement in the name of  Bowater or otherwise and any act or
proceeding by any provision  of this trust agreement required to be done or
performed by the  Board of Directors of Bowater or any officers of Bowater
may be  done and performed with like force and effect by the directors  or
officers of such Bowater Successor. 

  



  

  11.3 _Wholly-Owned  Subsidiaries._ Nothing herein shall be construed  as
preventing the amalgamation or merger of any wholly-owned  direct or indirect
subsidiary of Bowater with or into Bowater or  the  winding-up, 
liquidation or dissolution of any wholly-owned subsidiary of  Bowater
provided that all of the assets of such subsidiary are  transferred to
Bowater or another wholly-owned direct or  indirect subsidiary of Bowater and
any such transactions are  expressly permitted by this Article 11.

 Each director shall serve for a term ending on the date of the third annual meeting of stockholders following the annual meeting at which such director was elected; provided, however, that each initial director in Class I shall serve for a term ending on the date of the annual meeting next following the date hereof; each initial director in Class II shall serve for a term ending on the date of the second annual meeting following the date hereof; and each initial director in Class III shall serve for a term ending on the date of the third annual meeting following the date hereof. 

  

 In the event of any increase or decrease in the authorized number of directors, (i) each director then serving as such shall nevertheless continue as director of the class of which he is a member until the expiration of his current term, or his prior death, retirement or resignation, and (ii) the newly created or eliminated directorships resulting from such increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the three classes of directors so as to ensure that no one class has more than one director more than any other class. To the extent possible consistent with the foregoing rule, any newly created directorships shall be added to those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the latest dates following such allocation, and any newly eliminated directorships shall be subtracted from those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the earliest dates following such allocation, unless otherwise provided for from time to time by resolution of the Board. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained herein, each director shall serve until a successor is elected and qualified or until his death, resignation or removal. 

  

 SEVENTH: A director may be removed only for cause, and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of seventy-five percent (75%) of shares entitled to vote at 

   ##### 

  

    

an election of directors. No reduction in the number of directors shall have
the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of his term. 

  

 EIGHTH: Any vacancies in the Board occurring for any reason, and any newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors, may be filled only by the Board, acting by (i) a vote of at least a majority of the remaining directors then in office, though less than a quorum, if no Acquiring Stockholder (as defined herein) has become such in the twelve months immediately preceding the occurrence of such vacancy or the creation of such new directorship, or (ii) a vote of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the Continuing Directors (as defined herein) then in office, though less than a quorum, if an Acquiring Stockholder has become such in the twelve months immediately preceding the occurrence of such vacancy or the creation of such new directorship. Each director so chosen shall hold office until the next election of directors of the class for which such director shall have been chosen, and until his successor is duly elected and shall qualify, or until his earlier death, resignation or removal. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute.

Such affirmative vote shall be required notwithstanding the fact that no vote may be required or that a lesser percentage may be specified by law or in any agreement with any national securities exchange or otherwise. 

  

 (C) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section (B) above shall not be applicable if any of the following conditions are satisfied with respect to any particular Business Combination.

 (1) Whether the proposed Business Combination is within the scope of this Article; and 

   

 (2) Whether a stockholder is an Acquiring Stockholder. 

  

 Such determination, if made in good faith, shall be binding upon all parties. 

  

 (E) Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed to relieve any Acquiring Stockholder from any fiduciary obligation imposed by law.

   ##### 

  

  

 (F) To the maximum extent permissible under Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders of the Corporation shall be entitled to the statutory appraisal rights provided therein, notwithstanding any exception otherwise provided therein, with respect to any Business Combination involving the Corporation and any Acquiring Stockholder or Affiliate of an Acquiring Stockholder which, pursuant to this Article, requires the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of Voting Stock of the Corporation. 

  

 TENTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the Board is expressly authorized, subject, however, to other applicable provision in this Certificate of Incorporation, to designate by resolution or resolutions passed by a majority of the whole board, one or more committees, each committee to consist of two or more of the directors of the Corporation, which, to the extent provided in said resolution or resolutions or in the By-Laws of the Corporation, shall have and may exercise the powers of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may have power to authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers which may require it.

 ELEVENTH: 

  

 (A) In order to induce officers, directors, employees or agents of this Corporation to serve or continue to serve as its officers or directors, or to serve or to continue to serve at the request of this Corporation as director or officer of another corporation, in consideration of such service this Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each such person now or hereafter so serving from and against any and all claims and liabilities to which he may be or become subject to reason of his now hereafter being or having heretofore been a director or officer of this Corporation, or by reason of having served as a director or officer of another corporation or enterprise at the request of this Corporation, by reason of his alleged acts or omissions as director or officer as aforesaid, and shall reimburse each such person for all legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by him in connection with defending against any such claims or liabilities, to the full extent permitted in Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or any successor statute. The foregoing right of indemnification shall in no way be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such officer or director may be entitled, under any By-Law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise. 

  

 (B) To the full extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, a director of the Corporation shall not be 

   ##### 

  

    

liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach
of fiduciary duty as a director. 

  

 (C) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Article ELEVENTH shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.

 THIRTEENTH: (A) New By-Laws of the Corporation may be adopted or the By-Laws of the Corporation may be amended or repealed by a vote of either a majority of the directors of the Corporation or a majority of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Corporation; provided, however, that any By-Laws concerning the election or removal of directors, the range of the number of directors, the exact number of directors within such range or the method of fixing either such range or the exact number of directors within such range, the classification of the Board, the filling of vacancies on the Board, the requirement that all stockholder action must be taken at an annual or special meeting, the calling of special meetings of the stockholders, or the method of adopting, amending or repealing of By-Laws may not be amended, adopted or repealed, nor shall any other By-Law be amended, adopted or repealed which will have the effect of modifying or permitting the circumvention of such By-Laws, unless such adoption, amendment or repeal is approved by the affirmative vote of seventy-five percent (75%) of the Continuing Directors (where such adoption, amendment or repeal may be effected by the Board) or by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Corporation. The foregoing notwithstanding, in case of any irreconcilable inconsistency between this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws of the Corporation, provisions in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall prevail. 

  

 (B) The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereinafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred to stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions set forth in Articles FOURTH, FIFTH, SIXTH, SEVENTH, EIGHTH, NINTH, the last sentence of Article TENTH, TWELFTH and this Article THIRTEENTH may not be repealed or amended in any respect, nor may any cumulative voting provisions be amended, adopted or repealed which would have the effect of modifying or permitting circumvention of such provisions, unless such repeal, amendment or adoption is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Corporation.

OF  

  

ABITIBIBOWATER INC.  

  

 These Amended and Restated By-Laws (the "By-Laws") of AbitibiBowater Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Corporation"), shall become effective upon the closing (the "Closing") of the transactions contemplated by that certain Combination Agreement and Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of January 29, 2007 (as amended, the "Combination Agreement"), among the Corporation, Bowater Incorporated ("Bowater"), Abitibi-Bowater Merger Sub Inc., Bowater Canada Inc. and Abitibi-Consolidated Inc. ("Abitibi"). 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

 _Meetings of Stockholders_   

  

 Section 1.1. _Annual Meetings_. The annual meeting of the CorporationÂ’s stockholders for the election of directors and for such other matters as may be properly brought before the stockholdersÂ’ meeting shall be held in each year on such date and at such time and place either within or without the State of Delaware as shall be determined by resolution of the CorporationÂ’s Board of Directors (the "Board"). 

  

 Any business properly brought before an annual meeting of stockholders may be transacted at that meeting. To be properly brought before an annual meeting, the business must be (i) specified in the written notice of the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board or otherwise brought before the meeting by or at the direction of the Board, or (ii) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given written notice of the proposed business, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the Secretary of the Corporation, such that the Secretary shall receive such notice at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting or not later than ten (10) days after notice or public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting shall be given or made to stockholders, whichever date shall be earlier. Subject to Section 1.11 of these By-Laws, any such notice shall set forth the following as to each item of business the stockholder shall propose to bring before the annual meeting: 

   

 (a) a description of such item of business and the reasons for conducting it at such meeting and, in the event that such item of business shall include a proposal to 

   ##### 

  

    

amend either the CorporationÂ’s Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws,
the text of the proposed amendment; 

   

 (b) the name and address of the stockholder proposing such item of business; 

   

 (c) the class and number of shares held of record, held beneficially and represented by proxy by such stockholder as of the record date for the meeting (if such a date has been established) and as of the date of such notice and a representation that the stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such item of business; and 

   

 (d) any material interest of the stockholder in such item of business. 

  

 Only business that shall have been properly brought before an annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with these By-Laws shall be conducted at such meeting, and the officer or other person presiding over the meeting as provided in Section 1.5 of these By-Laws shall refuse to permit any business to be brought before such meeting that shall not have been properly brought before it in accordance with these By-Laws. 

  

 Section 1.2. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the Board, the "Chairman" (as defined in Section 4.1), the "President and CEO" (as defined in Section 4.1), or a committee of the Board which has been duly designated by the Board and whose powers and authority, as provided in a resolution of the Board or in these By-Laws, include the power to call such meetings, and special meetings may not be called by any other person or persons. Each such call shall state the time, place and purpose of the meeting. The place of the meeting may be any place stated in the call, within or outside the State of Delaware. 

  

 Section 1.3. _Notice of Meetings_. Notice of each annual or special meeting of the stockholders stating the place, day and hour thereof and the purposes for which the meeting is to be held shall be given in the manner specified by Section 7.3 by the Secretary (or by a person designated for the purpose either by the Secretary or by the person or persons calling the meeting or by the Board), not less than ten (10) or more than sixty (60) days prior to the meeting, except that where the matter to be acted on is a merger or consolidation of the Corporation, or a sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of its assets, such notice shall be given not less than twenty (20) days nor more than sixty (60) days prior to such meeting. 

  

 Section 1.4. _Action; Quorum_. No action shall be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders. At any meeting of the stockholders, unless otherwise provided by law or by the CorporationÂ’s Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of shares of stock of the Corporation representing at least one-third of the voting power of the stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote upon a question to be considered at the meeting, present in person or by proxy, shall be necessary to and shall constitute a quorum for the consideration of such question. If at any time the Corporation has outstanding shares of stock ("contingent vote shares") the voting power of which is dependent upon the receipt by the record holder of such contingent vote shares of instructions from holders of securities of a subsidiary of the Corporation, then for purposes of 

   ##### 

  

    

determining the voting power of the stock of the Corporation issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote upon a question to be considered at the
meeting, the record holder of such contingent vote shares shall be deemed to
have received instructions from each holder of such subsidiary securities
entitled to provide such instructions, and for the purposes of
determining the voting power of the shares of stock present in person or by
proxy at such meeting, such contingent vote shares shall only have the voting
power to which they would otherwise be entitled based on the instructions
actually received by such record holder. If, however, a meeting
of stockholders cannot be organized because a quorum has not attended, the
stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or represented by
proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without
notice other than announcement at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken of the time and place of the adjourned meeting, until a quorum shall be
present or represented. In case of a meeting for the election of directors,
such meeting may be adjourned only from day to day or for such longer
periods, not exceeding fifteen (15) days each, until such directors have been
elected. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present
or represented, any business may be transacted that might have been
transacted had a quorum been present at the time originally fixed for the
meeting. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after
the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting,
notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record
entitled to vote at the meeting. 

  

 Section 1.5. _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the Chairman, or in his or her absence by the President and CEO, or in his or her absence by a Vice President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chairperson designated by the Board, or in the absence of such designation by a chairperson chosen at the meeting. The Secretary of the Corporation shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chairperson of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. 

  

 Section 1.6. _Voting; Proxies_. When a quorum is present at any meeting, all elections of directors shall be determined by plurality vote, and all other questions brought before such meeting shall be determined by the vote of stockholders present, in person or by proxy, entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes which all stockholders present are entitled to cast on the particular matter, unless the question is one upon which, by express provisions of these By-Laws, the laws of the State of Delaware or of the CorporationÂ’s Certificate of Incorporation, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. 

  

 Each stockholder having the right to vote shall at every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to vote in person or by proxy; and unless otherwise provided by statute or the CorporationÂ’s Certificate of Incorporation, each stockholder of record shall be entitled to one vote for each outstanding share registered in its name on the books of the Corporation as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting. 

  

 Each proxy shall be in writing, executed by the stockholder giving the proxy or by his attorney thereunto authorized, or by a facsimile or other electronic means, filed with the Secretary of the Corporation, but no proxy shall be voted after three (3) years from its date, unless the proxy expressly provides for a longer period. A proxy, unless coupled with an interest, shall be revocable at will, notwithstanding any other agreement or any provision in the 

   ##### 

  

    

proxy to the contrary, but the revocation of a proxy shall not be effective
until notice thereof has been given to the Secretary of the Corporation. A
proxy shall not be revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless,
before the vote is counted or the authority is exercised, written notice of
such death or incapacity is given to the Secretary of the Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.7. _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders of any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. If no record date is fixed, then (i) the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; and (ii) the record date for determining stockholders of record for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto. A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of, or to vote at, a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting in which case notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 

  

 Section 1.8. _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of meeting or (ii) during ordinary business hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation. The list of stockholders must also be open to examination at the meeting as required by applicable law. Except as otherwise provided by law, the stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list of stockholders or the books of the Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders. 

  

 Section 1.9. _Inspectors of Election_. The Corporation may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof. The Corporation may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector so appointed or designated is able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the person presiding at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute faithfully the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The inspector or inspectors so 

   ##### 

  

    

appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the number of shares of capital
stock of the Corporation outstanding and the voting power of each such share,
(ii) determine the shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at
the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots, (iii) count all votes
and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of
the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors,
and (v) certify the determination of the number of shares of capital stock of
the Corporation represented at the meeting and such inspectorÂ’s count of all
votes and ballots. Such certification and report shall specify such other
information as may be required by law. In determining the validity
and counting of proxies and ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of
the Corporation, the inspectors may consider such information as is permitted
by applicable law. No person who is a candidate for an office at an election
may serve as an inspector at such election. 

  

 Section 1.10. _Conduct of Meetings_. The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the meeting by the person presiding over the meeting. The Board may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board, the person presiding over any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such presiding person, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed by the presiding person of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (iii) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the presiding person of the meeting shall determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (v) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants. The presiding person at any meeting of stockholders, in addition to making any other determinations that may be appropriate to the conduct of the meeting, shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare to the meeting that a matter or business was not properly brought before the meeting and if such presiding person should so determine, such presiding person shall so declare to the meeting and any such matter or business not properly brought before the meeting shall not be transacted or considered.

   #####

 (ii) Exactly fifty percent (50%) of the members of the CorporationÂ’s Board shall consist of the Chairman and directors elected from among the "Abitibi Nominees" (as defined in Section 3.3) (all of the foregoing members of the Board, and any replacement for any such members appointed or nominated by an in accordance with these By-Laws, to be referred individually as an "Abitibi Director" and collectively as the "Abitibi Directors"); and exactly fifty percent (50%) of the members of the CorporationÂ’s Board shall consist of the President and CEO and directors elected from among the "Bowater Nominees" (as defined in Section 3.3) (the foregoing members of the Board, and any replacement for any such members appointed or nominated in accordance with these By-Laws, to be referred to individually as a "Bowater Director" and collectively as the "Bowater Directors"). 

   

 (iii) so long as the Chairman of the Board is not an independent director, one Abitibi Director selected by a majority of the Abitibi Directors, and one Bowater Director selected by a majority of the Bowater Directors, shall serve as co-lead directors (the "Co-Lead Directors"). The Co-Lead Directors shall chair any meeting of the independent directors in executive session. 

  

 The Board shall be and is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III. No one class shall have more than one director more than any other class. If a fraction is contained in the quotient arrived at by dividing the authorized number of directors by three, then if such fraction is one-third, the extra director shall be a member of Class III, and if such fraction is two-thirds, one of the extra directors shall be a member of Class III and one of the extra directors shall be a member of Class II, unless otherwise provided for from time to time by resolution of the Board. The Abitibi Directors and Bowater Directors shall be apportioned among the three classes of directors such that (i) the class of directors standing for election at the first annual meeting of stockholders following the Closing contains two Abitibi Directors and two Bowater Directors, (ii) the class of directors standing for election at the second annual meeting following the Closing contains two Abitibi Directors and three Bowater Directors and (iii) the class standing for election at the third annual meeting following the Closing contains three Abitibi Directors and two Bowater Directors.

 In the event of any increase or decrease in the authorized number of directors, (i) each director then serving as such shall nevertheless continue as director of the class of which he is a member until the expiration of his current term, or his prior death, retirement or resignation, and 

   ##### 

  

 

(ii) the newly created or eliminated directorships resulting from such
increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the three
classes of directors so as to ensure that no one class has more than one
director more than any other class. To the extent possible consistent
with the foregoing rule, any newly created directorships shall be added to
those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the latest dates
following such allocation, and any newly eliminated directorships shall be
subtracted from those classes whose terms of office are to expire at
the earliest dates following such allocation, unless otherwise provided for
from time to time by resolution of the Board. No reduction in the number of
directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the
expiration of his or her term. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary
contained herein, each director shall serve until a successor is elected and
qualified or until his death, resignation or removal.

Any director may resign at any time upon notice to the Corporation. 

  

 Any vacancies in the Board occurring for any reason and any newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors may be filled only in accordance with the procedures set forth in the CorporationÂ’s Certificate of Incorporation. Each director so chosen shall hold office until the next election of directors of the class of which he or she is a member and until his or her successor is duly elected and shall qualify, or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal. If there are no directors in office, then an election of directors may be held in the manner provided by statute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the Third Annual Meeting: (i) any vacancy created by the removal of an Abitibi Director shall be filled with a designee approved by the majority vote of the remaining Abitibi Directors; and (ii) any vacancy created by the removal of a Bowater Director shall be filled with a designee approved by majority vote of the remaining Bowater Directors. The Board shall take such actions as are necessary under the CorporationÂ’s Certificate of Incorporation to fill such vacancy with the individuals so designated. The provisions of the preceding two sentences may be waived or amended by a Required Majority Vote.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, a change of the CorporationÂ’s headquarters or headquarters functions must be approved by a Two-thirds Majority Vote. 

  

 Section 2.7. _Organization_. Meetings of the Board shall be presided over by the Chairman, or in his or her absence by the President and CEO, or in his or her absence by a chairperson chosen at the meeting. The CorporationÂ’s Secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chairperson of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. 

  

 Section 2.8. _Action by Unanimous Consent of Directors_. Unless otherwise restricted by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission and the writing or writings or electronic transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board or committee in accordance with applicable law.

dividends and the distribution of assets in the event of the

ARTICLE 3 

   

DIVIDENDS  

  

     3.1  |   | A holder of an Exchangeable Share shall be entitled to
receive and the Board of Directors shall, subject to applicable law, on each
AbitibiBowater Dividend Declaration Date, declare a dividend on each
Exchangeable Share:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

 (a) in the case of a cash dividend declared on the AbitibiBowater Common Shares, in an amount in cash for each Exchangeable Share in U.S. dollars or the Canadian Dollar Equivalent thereof on the AbitibiBowater Dividend Declaration Date of the cash dividend declared on each AbitibiBowater Common Share; 

  

 (b) in the case of a stock dividend declared on the AbitibiBowater Common Shares to be paid in AbitibiBowater Common Shares, in such number of Exchangeable Shares for each Exchangeable Share as is equal to the number of AbitibiBowater Common Shares to be paid on each AbitibiBowater Common Share; or 

  

 (c) in the case of a dividend declared on the AbitibiBowater Common Shares in property other than cash or AbitibiBowater Common Shares, in such type and amount of property for each Exchangeable Share as is the same as or economically equivalent to (to be determined by the Board of Directors as contemplated by Section 3.5 hereof) the type and amount of property declared as a dividend on each AbitibiBowater Common Share. 

 

Such dividends shall be paid out of money, assets or property of
AbitibiBowater Canada properly applicable to the payment of dividends, or out
of authorized but unissued shares of AbitibiBowater Canada, as applicable. 

   

     3.2  |   | Cheques of AbitibiBowater Canada payable at par at any
branch of the bankers of AbitibiBowater Canada shall be issued in respect of
any cash dividends contemplated by Section 3.1(a) hereof and the sending of
such a cheque to each holder of an Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the cash
dividend represented thereby unless the cheque is not paid on
presentation. Certificates registered in the name of the registered holder of
Exchangeable Shares shall be issued or transferred in respect of any stock
dividends contemplated by Section 3.1(b) hereof and the sending of such a
certificate to each holder of an Exchangeable Share shall satisfy the stock
dividend represented thereby. Such other type and amount of property in
respect of any dividends contemplated by Section 3.1(c) hereof shall be
issued, distributed or transferred by AbitibiBowater Canada in such manner as
it shall determine and the issuance, distribution or transfer thereof by
AbitibiBowater Canada to each holder of an Exchangeable Share shall satisfy
the dividend represented thereby. No holder of an Exchangeable Share shall be
entitled to recover by action or other legal process against AbitibiBowater
Canada any dividend that is represented by a cheque that has not been  
---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   | duly presented to AbitibiBowater CanadaÂ’s bankers for
payment or that otherwise remains unclaimed for a period of six years from

for the corresponding dividend declared on the AbitibiBowater Common Shares.  
      
  3.4  |   | If on any payment date for any dividends declared on the
Exchangeable Shares under Section 3.1 hereof the dividends are not paid in
full on all of the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding, any such dividends
that remain unpaid shall be paid on a subsequent date or dates determined by
the Board of Directors on which AbitibiBowater Canada shall have
sufficient moneys, assets or property properly applicable to the payment of
such dividends.  
      
  3.5  |   | The Board of Directors shall determine, in good faith and in
its sole discretion (with the assistance of such reputable and qualified
independent financial advisors and/or other experts as the Board of Directors
may require), economic equivalence for the purposes of Section 3.1(c) hereof,
and each such determination shall be conclusive and binding on
AbitibiBowater Canada and its shareholders. In making each such
determination, the following factors shall, without excluding other factors
determined by the Board of Directors to be relevant, be considered by the
Board of Directors:  
   

  

 (a) in the case of any stock dividend or other distribution payable in AbitibiBowater Common Shares, the number of such shares issued in proportion to the number of AbitibiBowater Common Shares previously outstanding; 

  

 (b) in the case of the issuance or distribution of any rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase AbitibiBowater Common Shares (or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire AbitibiBowater Common Shares), the relationship between the exercise price of each such right, option or warrant and the current market value (as determined by the Board of Directors in the manner above contemplated) of an AbitibiBowater Common Share; 

  

 (c) in the case of the issuance or distribution of any other form of property (including without limitation any shares or securities of AbitibiBowater of any class other than AbitibiBowater Common Shares, any rights, options or warrants other than those referred to in Section 3.5(b) above, any evidence of indebtedness of AbitibiBowater or any assets of AbitibiBowater ), the relationship between the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors in the manner above contemplated) of such property to be issued or distributed with respect to each outstanding AbitibiBowater Common Share and the current market value (as determined by the Board of Directors in the manner above contemplated) of an AbitibiBowater Common Share; and 

  

 (d) in all such cases, the general taxation consequences of the relevant event to holders of Exchangeable Shares to the extent that such consequences may differ from the taxation consequences to holders of AbitibiBowater Common Shares as a result of differences between taxation laws of Canada and the United States (except for any differing consequences arising as a result of differing marginal taxation rates and without regard to the individual circumstances of holders of Exchangeable Shares). 

 

For purposes of the foregoing determinations, the current market value of any
security listed and traded or quoted on a securities exchange shall be the
weighted average of the daily trading prices of such security during a period
of not less than 20 consecutive trading days ending not more than five
trading days before the date of determination on the principal securities
exchange on which such securities are listed and traded or quoted; provided,
however, that if in the opinion of the Board of Directors the public
distribution or trading activity of such securities during such period does
not create a market which 

  ##### 

  

   

reflects the fair market value of such securities, then the current market
value thereof shall be determined by the Board of Directors, in good faith
and in its sole discretion (with the assistance of such reputable and
qualified independent financial advisors and/or other experts as the
board may require), and provided further that any such determination by the
Board of Directors shall be conclusive and binding on AbitibiBowater Canada
and its shareholders. 

   

ARTICLE 4 

   

CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS  

  

     4.1  |   | So long as any of the Exchangeable Shares are
outstanding, AbitibiBowater Canada shall not at any time without, but may at
any time with, the approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given
as specified in Section 10.2 of these share provisions:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

 (a) pay any dividends on the Common Shares, the Preferred Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares, other than stock dividends payable in Common Shares or any such other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be; 

  

 (b) redeem or purchase or make any capital distribution in respect of Common Shares, Preferred Shares or any other shares ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares; 

  

 (c) redeem or purchase any other shares of AbitibiBowater Canada ranking equally with the Exchangeable Shares with respect to the payment of dividends or on any liquidation distribution; or 

  

 (d) issue any Exchangeable Shares or any other shares of AbitibiBowater Canada ranking equally with, or superior to, the Exchangeable Shares other than by way of stock dividends to the holders of such Exchangeable Shares. 

 

The restrictions in Section 4.1(a), 4.1(b), 4.1(c) and 4.1(d) above shall not
apply if all dividends on the outstanding Exchangeable Shares corresponding
to dividends declared and paid to date on the AbitibiBowater Common Shares
shall have been declared and paid in full on the Exchangeable Shares. 

   

ARTICLE 5 

   

DISTRIBUTION ON LIQUIDATION  

  

     5.1  |   | In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of AbitibiBowater Canada or any other distribution of the assets
of AbitibiBowater Canada among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up
its affairs, a holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled, subject to
applicable law, to receive from the assets of AbitibiBowater Canada in respect
of each Exchangeable Share held by such holder on the effective date (the
"Liquidation Date") of such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, before
any distribution of any part of the assets of AbitibiBowater Canada among the
holders of the Common Shares, the Preferred Shares or any other shares
ranking junior to the Exchangeable Shares, an amount per share (the
"Liquidation Amount") equal to:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

 (a) the Current Market Price of an AbitibiBowater Common Share on the last Business Day prior to the Liquidation Date, which shall be satisfied in full by AbitibiBowater Canada causing to be delivered to such holder one AbitibiBowater Common Share; plus 

  

 (b) the right to receive the full amount when paid of all unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable Share for which the record date has occurred prior to the Liquidation Date. 

   ##### 

  

  

     5.2  |   | On or promptly after the Liquidation Date, and subject
to the exercise by Bowater Canadian Holdings of the Liquidation Call Right,
AbitibiBowater Canada shall cause to be delivered to the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount for each such Exchangeable
Share upon presentation and surrender of the certificates representing such
Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as
may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the _Canada
Business Corporations Act_ and the by-laws of AbitibiBowater Canada and such
additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may reasonably
require, at the registered office of AbitibiBowater Canada or at any office of
the Transfer Agent as may be specified by AbitibiBowater Canada by notice to
the holders of the Exchangeable Shares. Payment of the total Liquidation
Amount for such Exchangeable Shares shall be made by delivery to each holder,
at the address of the holder recorded in the securities register of
AbitibiBowater Canada for the Exchangeable Shares or by holding for pick-up
by the holder at the registered office of AbitibiBowater Canada or at any
office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by AbitibiBowater Canada by
notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares, on behalf of AbitibiBowater
Canada of certificates representing AbitibiBowater Common Shares (which
shares shall be duly issued as fully paid and non-assessable and shall be
free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance) and on the applicable
dividend payment date a cheque of AbitibiBowater Canada payable at par at
any branch of the bankers of AbitibiBowater Canada in respect of the full
amount of any unpaid dividends comprising part of the total Liquidation
Amount (in each case less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to
be deducted and withheld therefrom by AbitibiBowater Canada). On and after
the Liquidation Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall cease to
be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise
any of the rights of holders in respect thereof, other than the right to
receive their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount, unless
payment of the total Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable Shares shall
not be made upon presentation and surrender of share certificates
in accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the
holders shall remain unaffected until the total Liquidation Amount has been
paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. AbitibiBowater Canada shall have
the right at any time after the Liquidation Date to deposit or cause to be
deposited the total Liquidation Amount in respect of the Exchangeable Shares
represented by certificates that have not at the Liquidation Date
been surrendered by the holders thereof in a custodial account with any
chartered bank or trust company in Canada. Upon such deposit being made, the
rights of the holders of Exchangeable Shares after such deposit shall be
limited to receiving their proportionate part of the total Liquidation Amount
(in each case less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to
be deducted and withheld therefrom) for such Exchangeable Shares so
deposited, against presentation and surrender of the said certificates held
by them, respectively, in accordance with the foregoing provisions. Upon such
payment or deposit of the total Liquidation Amount, the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be considered and deemed for
all purposes to be holders of the AbitibiBowater Common Shares delivered to
them or the custodian on their behalf.  
---|---|--- 
      
  5.3  |   | After AbitibiBowater Canada has satisfied its obligations to
pay the holders of the Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount per
Exchangeable Share pursuant to Section 5.1 of these share provisions, such
holders shall not be entitled to share in any further distribution of the
assets of AbitibiBowater Canada.

ARTICLE 6 

   

RETRACTION OF EXCHANGEABLE SHARES BY HOLDER  

  

     6.1  |   | A holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled at
any time, subject to the exercise by Bowater Canadian Holdings of the
Retraction Call Right and otherwise upon compliance with the provisions of
this Article 6, to require AbitibiBowater Canada to redeem any or all of
the Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of such holder for an amount
per share equal to (a) the Current Market Price of an AbitibiBowater Common
Share on the last Business Day prior to the Retraction Date, which shall be
satisfied in full by AbitibiBowater Canada causing to be delivered to such
holder one AbitibiBowater Common Share for each Exchangeable Share
presented and surrendered by the holder, plus (b) the right to receive the
full amount when paid of all unpaid dividends thereon for which the record
date for such dividends has occurred prior to the Retraction Date
(collectively the "Retraction Price"). To effect such redemption, the holder
shall present and surrender at the registered office of AbitibiBowater Canada
or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by AbitibiBowater
Canada by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares the certificate or
certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares which the holder desires to
have AbitibiBowater Canada redeem, together with such other documents and
instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares
under the _Canada Business Corporations Act_ and the by-laws of
AbitibiBowater Canada and such additional documents and instruments as the
Transfer Agent may reasonably require, and together with a duly executed
statement (the "Retraction Request") in the form of Schedule A hereto or in
such other form as may be acceptable to AbitibiBowater Canada.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

 (a) specifying that the holder desires to have all or any number specified therein of the Exchangeable Shares represented by such certificate or certificates (the "Retracted Shares") redeemed by AbitibiBowater Canada; 

  

 (b) stating the Business Day on which the holder desires to have AbitibiBowater Canada redeem the Retracted Shares (the "Retraction Date"), provided that the Retraction Date shall be not less than 10 Business Days nor more than 15 Business Days after the date on which the Retraction Request is received by AbitibiBowater Canada and further provided that, in the event that no such Business Day is specified by the holder in the Retraction Request, the Retraction Date shall be deemed to be the fifteenth Business Day after the date on which the Retraction Request is received by AbitibiBowater Canada; and 

  

 (c) acknowledging the overriding right (the "Retraction Call Right") of Bowater Canadian Holdings to purchase all but not less than all the Retracted Shares directly from the holder and that the Retraction Request shall be deemed to be a revocable offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares to Bowater Canadian Holdings in accordance with the Retraction Call Right on the terms and conditions set out in Section 6.3 below. 

  

     6.2  |   | Subject to the exercise by Bowater Canadian Holdings of
the Retraction Call Right, upon receipt by AbitibiBowater Canada or the
Transfer Agent in the manner specified in Section 6.1 hereof of a certificate
or certificates representing the number of Exchangeable Shares which the
holder desires to have AbitibiBowater Canada redeem, together with a
Retraction Request, and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked
by the holder in the manner specified in Section 6.7, AbitibiBowater Canada
shall redeem the Retracted Shares effective at the close of business on the
Retraction Date and shall cause to be delivered to such holder the
total Retraction Price with respect to such shares (provided that any unpaid
dividends forming part of the Retraction Price shall be paid on the payment
date for such dividends). If only a part of the Exchangeable Shares
represented by any certificate is redeemed (or purchased by Bowater Canadian
Holdings pursuant  
---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   | to the Retraction Call Right), a new certificate for the
balance of such Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to the holder at the
expense of AbitibiBowater Canada.  
---|---|--- 
      
  6.3  |   | Upon receipt by AbitibiBowater Canada of a Retraction
Request, AbitibiBowater Canada shall immediately notify AbitibiBowater and
Bowater Canadian Holdings thereof. In order to exercise the Retraction Call
Right, Bowater Canadian Holdings must notify AbitibiBowater Canada of
its determination to do so (the "Bowater Canadian Holdings Call Notice")
within five Business Days of notification to Bowater Canadian Holdings by
AbitibiBowater Canada of the receipt by AbitibiBowater Canada of the
Retraction Request. If Bowater Canadian Holdings delivers the Bowater
Canadian Holdings Call Notice within such five Business Day time period, and
provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the
manner specified in Section 6.7, the Retraction Request shall thereupon be
considered only to be an offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares to
Bowater Canadian Holdings in accordance with the Retraction Call Right. In
such event, AbitibiBowater Canada shall not redeem the Retracted Shares and
Bowater Canadian Holdings shall purchase from such holder and such holder
shall sell to Bowater Canadian Holdings on the Retraction Date the Retracted
Shares for a purchase price (the "Purchase Price") per share equal to the
Retraction Price per share. For the purposes of completing a purchase
pursuant to the Retraction Call Right, Bowater Canadian Holdings
shall deposit with the Transfer Agent, on or before the Retraction Date,
certificates representing AbitibiBowater Common Shares and shall waive any
rights to receive any dividends which represent the amount of the remaining
portion, if any, of the total Purchase Price (in each case less any amounts
withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom by
Bowater Canadian Holdings). Provided that Bowater Canadian Holdings has
complied with the immediately preceding sentence, the closing of the purchase
and sale of the Retracted Shares pursuant to the Retraction Call Right shall
be deemed to have occurred as at the close of business on the Retraction Date
and, for greater certainty, no redemption by AbitibiBowater Canada of such
Retracted Shares shall take place on the Retraction Date. In the event
that Bowater Canadian Holdings does not deliver an Bowater Canadian Holdings
Call Notice within such five Business Day period, and provided that the
Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in
Section 6.7, AbitibiBowater Canada shall redeem the Retracted Shares on the
Retraction Date and in the manner otherwise contemplated in this Article 6.  
      
  6.4  |   | AbitibiBowater Canada or Bowater Canadian Holdings as the
case may be, shall deliver or cause the Transfer Agent to deliver to the
relevant holder, at the address of the holder recorded in the securities
register of AbitibiBowater Canada for the Exchangeable Shares or at the
address specified in the holderÂ’s Retraction Request or by holding for pick-
up by the holder at the registered office of AbitibiBowater Canada or at any
office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by AbitibiBowater Canada by
notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares, certificates representing the
AbitibiBowater Common Shares (which shares shall be duly issued as fully paid
and non-assessable and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim
or encumbrance) registered in the name of the holder or in such other name as
the holder may request in payment of the total Retraction Price or the total
Purchase Price, as the case may be, and on the applicable dividend payment
date a cheque payable at par at any branch of the bankers of AbitibiBowater
Canada in payment of the remaining portion, if any, of the total Retraction
Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be (in each case less
any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld
therefrom), and such delivery of such certificates and cheque on behalf of
AbitibiBowater Canada or by Bowater Canadian Holdings, as the case may be, or
by the Transfer Agent shall be deemed to be payment and shall satisfy and
discharge all liability for the total Retraction Price or total
Purchase Price, as the case may be, to the extent that the same is
represented by such share certificates and cheque (plus any tax deducted and
withheld therefrom and remitted to the proper tax authority), unless such
cheque is not paid on due presentation.  
   

    ##### 

 

   

     6.5  |   | On and after the close of business on the Retraction
Date, the holder of the Retracted Shares shall cease to be a holder of such
Retracted Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a
holder in respect thereof, other than the right to receive his proportionate
part of the total Retraction Price or total Purchase Price, as the case may
be, unless upon presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with
the foregoing provisions, payment of the total Retraction Price or the total
Purchase Price, as the case may be, shall not be made as provided in Section
6.4, in which case the rights of such holder shall remain unaffected until
the total Retraction Price or the total Purchase Price, as the case may be,
has been paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. On and after the close
of business on the Retraction Date, provided that presentation and surrender
of certificates and payment of the total Retraction Price or the total
Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been made in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, the holder of the Retracted Shares so redeemed by
AbitibiBowater Canada or purchased by Bowater Canadian Holdings shall
thereafter be considered and deemed for all purposes to be a holder of the
AbitibiBowater Common Shares delivered to it.  
---|---|--- 
      
  6.6  |   | Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 6,
AbitibiBowater Canada shall not be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares
specified by a holder in a Retraction Request to the extent that such
redemption of Retracted Shares would be contrary to solvency requirements
or other provisions of applicable law. If AbitibiBowater Canada believes that
on any Retraction Date it would not be permitted by any of such provisions to
redeem the Retracted Shares tendered for redemption on such date, and
provided that Bowater Canadian Holdings shall not have exercised the
Retraction Call Right with respect to the Retracted Shares,
AbitibiBowater Canada shall only be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares
specified by a holder in a Retraction Request to the extent of the maximum
number that may be so redeemed (rounded down to a whole number of shares) as
would not be contrary to such provisions and shall notify the holder at least
two Business Days prior to the Retraction Date as to the number of
Retracted Shares which will not be redeemed by AbitibiBowater Canada. In any
case in which the redemption by AbitibiBowater Canada of Retracted Shares
would be contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable
law, AbitibiBowater Canada shall redeem Retracted Shares in accordance with
Section 6.2 of these share provisions on a _pro rata_ basis and shall issue
to each holder of Retracted Shares a new certificate, at the expense
of AbitibiBowater Canada, representing the Retracted Shares not redeemed by
AbitibiBowater Canada pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof. Provided that the
Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified in
Section 6.7, the holder of any such Retracted Shares not redeemed by
AbitibiBowater Canada pursuant to Section 6.2 of these share provisions as
a result of solvency requirements of applicable law shall be deemed by giving
the Retraction Request to require AbitibiBowater to purchase such Retracted
Shares from such holder on the Retraction Date or as soon as practicable
thereafter on payment by AbitibiBowater to such holder of the Purchase Price
for each such Retracted Share, all as more specifically provided in the
Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement.  
      
  6.7  |   | A holder of Retracted Shares may, by notice in writing given
by the holder to AbitibiBowater Canada before the close of business on the
Business Day immediately preceding the Retraction Date, withdraw its
Retraction Request, in which event such Retraction Request shall be null and
void and, for greater certainty, the revocable offer constituted by the
Retraction Request to sell the Retracted Shares to Bowater Canadian Holdings
shall be deemed to have been revoked.

ARTICLE 7 

   

REDEMPTION OF EXCHANGEABLE SHARES BY ABITIBIBOWATER CANADA  

  

     7.1  |   | Subject to applicable law, and provided Bowater
Canadian Holdings has not exercised the Redemption Call Right, AbitibiBowater
Canada shall on the Redemption Date redeem the whole of the then outstanding
Exchangeable Shares for an amount per share equal to (a) the Current Market
Price of an AbitibiBowater Common Share on the last Business Day prior to
the Redemption Date, which shall be satisfied in full by AbitibiBowater
Canada causing to be delivered to each holder of Exchangeable Shares one
AbitibiBowater Common Share for each Exchangeable Share held by such holder,
plus (b) the right to receive the full amount when paid of all unpaid

Article 7, AbitibiBowater Canada shall, at least 60 days before the
Redemption Date, send or cause to be sent to each holder of Exchangeable
Shares a notice in writing of the redemption by AbitibiBowater Canada or the
purchase by Bowater Canadian Holdings under the Redemption Call Right, as the
case may be, of the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event of a redemption of the Exchangeable Shares at
the election of the Board of Directors (or a purchase by Bowater Canadian
Holdings as a result thereof) upon a transaction being proposed that
would result in Control of AbitibiBowater being acquired by any Person,
AbitibiBowater Canada shall cause such notice to be sent at least the number
of days prior to the Redemption Date established by the Board of Directors as
the Board of Directors determines to be reasonably practicable under the
circumstances, _provided further_ , _however_ , that in each case
the accidental failure or omission to give such notice to fewer than 10% of
the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall not affect the validity of such

for determining the Redemption Price or the Redemption Call Purchase Price,

upon presentation and surrender at the registered office of AbitibiBowater
Canada or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by

Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and instruments as
may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares under the
_Canada Business Corporations Act_ and the by-laws of AbitibiBowater Canada
and such additional documents and instruments as the Transfer Agent may
reasonably require. Payment of the total Redemption Price for such
Exchangeable Shares shall be made by delivery to each holder, at the address
of the holder recorded in the securities register of AbitibiBowater Canada or
by holding for pick-up by the holder at the registered office of
AbitibiBowater Canada or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may be

applicable dividend payment date a cheque of AbitibiBowater Canada payable at
par at any branch of the bankers of AbitibiBowater Canada in respect of the
full amount of any unpaid dividends comprising part of the total
Redemption Price (in each case less any amounts withheld on account of tax
required to be withheld and remitted therefrom by AbitibiBowater Canada). On
and after the Redemption Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares called
for redemption shall cease to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and
shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect
thereof, other than the right to

     |   | receive their proportionate part of the total Redemption
Price, unless payment of the total Redemption Price for such Exchangeable
Shares shall not be made upon presentation and surrender of certificates in
accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the
holders shall remain unaffected until the total Redemption Price has been
paid in the manner hereinbefore provided. AbitibiBowater Canada shall have
the right at any time after the sending of notice of its intention to redeem
the Exchangeable Shares as aforesaid to deposit or cause to be deposited the
total Redemption Price of the Exchangeable Shares so called for redemption,
or of such of the said Exchangeable Shares represented by certificates that
have not at the date of such deposit been surrendered by the holders thereof
in connection with such redemption, in a custodial account with any chartered
bank or trust company in Canada named in such notice (less any amounts
withheld on account of tax required to be withheld and remitted therefrom by
AbitibiBowater Canada). Upon the later of such deposit being made and the
Redemption Date, the Exchangeable Shares in respect whereof such deposit
shall have been made shall be redeemed and the rights of the holders
thereof after such deposit or Redemption Date, as the case may be, shall be
limited to receiving their proportionate part of the total Redemption Price
for such Exchangeable Shares so deposited, against presentation and surrender
of the said certificate held by them, respectively, in accordance with the
foregoing provisions. Upon such payment or deposit of the total Redemption
Price, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall thereafter be considered
and deemed for all purposes to be holders of the AbitibiBowater Canada
Shares delivered to them or the custodian on their behalf.
