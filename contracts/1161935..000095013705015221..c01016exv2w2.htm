ARTICLE II 

   

THE MERGER 

   

 SECTION 2.01. Admission of New Partner Sub. 

  

 Prior to the effective time of any of the other transactions provided for in this Article II, at the Closing, the New Partner Sub shall be admitted to the Partnership as a limited partner and shall acquire Partnership Units of a new series of Partnership Interests, designated by the Company, representing a 0.01% interest in the Partnership in exchange for an appropriate capital contribution to the Partnership. 

  

 SECTION 2.02. Redemption of OP Units For LLC Interests. 

  

 (a) Following the Admission and prior to the effective time of any of the other transactions provided for in this Article II, all holders of Partnership Units (other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) who qualify as "accredited investors" (within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act) (each, an " _Accredited Investor_ ") and who shall have properly submitted and not have subsequently withdrawn Forms of Election in accordance with the procedures and time periods specified in _Section 8.10_, all in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions hereof and as contemplated hereby (each, a " _Redeeming OP Unit Holder_ "), shall, to the extent so elected, have their Partnership Units redeemed (with an aggregate value equal to the Aggregate Redemption Value (as defined below)) by the Partnership, and the Partnership agrees to redeem such Partnership Units, in 

     ##### 

 

   

exchange for (1) first, a percentage interest in Redemption Core Property I
LLC equal to the lesser of (A) 100% or (B) the percentage equal to (x) the
Aggregate Redemption Value divided by (y) the Redemption Core Property I Net
Value, and (2) second, if the Redemption Core Property I Net Value is less
than the Aggregate Redemption Value, then the Redeeming OP Unit Holders shall
receive a percentage interest in Redemption Core Property II LLC equal to the
percentage equal to (x) the Aggregate Redemption Value minus the Redemption
Core Property I Net Value divided by (y) the Redemption Core Property II Net
Value. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Redemption Core Property I Debt
is less than an amount equal to 110% of the aggregate of the "negative tax
capital account" balances of the Redeeming OP Unit Holders, as of the
Redemption Effective Time (the " _Required Debt_ "), the amount of which
Required Debt shall in no event exceed $75.0 million, the Redeeming OP Unit
Holders shall receive interests in Redemption Core Property I LLC
and Redemption Core Property II LLC with values equal, in the aggregate, to
the Aggregate Redemption Value. Such redemption distributions shall be made
to the individual Redeeming OP Unit Holders in proportion to their respective
Redemption Percentages. 

   

 (b) In connection with the Redemption, the Partnership shall provide Redeeming OP Unit Holders with the opportunity to guarantee the Redemption Core Property I Debt and/or Redemption Core Property II Debt, in an aggregate amount not less than the Required Debt, which guarantee opportunity shall be allocated among the Redeeming OP Unit Holders as determined by the Partnership. One-hundred percent (100%) of any Redemption Core Property II Debt shall be made available for guarantee by Redeeming OP Unit Holders at the time it is incurred. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Redemption Effective Time, (i) the Partnership and any other Company Subsidiary that owns any right, title or interest in the Redemption Core Properties shall have conveyed to Redemption Core Property I LLC and Redemption Core Property II LLC, as applicable, all of their respective right, title and interest in the Redemption Core Properties, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens (excluding any Liens securing the Redemption Core Property I Debt or Redemption Core Property II Debt), and (ii) each of Redemption Core Property I LLC and Redemption Core Property II LLC shall have assumed and accepted from the Partnership and any such Company Subsidiaries all liabilities and obligations of such parties arising from and after the Redemption Effective Time under any leases and contracts primarily related to the Redemption Core Property I and Redemption Core Property II, as applicable (other than any leasing or management agreement or other service agreement under which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is entitled to provide services with respect to any Redemption Core Property, which agreements shall be terminated as of the Closing Date) and the obligations under the Redemption Core Property I Debt and the Redemption Core Property II Debt, if any. The parties agree that the value of Redemption Core Property I has been allocated as set forth on Exhibit B hereto. The terms of the Redemption pursuant to this Section 2.02 shall not be affected by any change in the value of the Redemption OP Units or of the Redemption Core Properties, in each case, during the Interim Period. 

   

 (d) Except with respect to a Redeeming OP Unit Holder that has contributed property to the Partnership in exchange for Redemption OP Units in the seven years prior to the Redemption, the Company and the Partnership intend that, for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, the Redemption will be treated as a non-taxable distribution of an undivided interest in 

    ##### 

  

    

the Redemption Core Properties from the Partnership to the Redeeming OP Unit
Holders in liquidation and redemption of the Redeeming OP Unit Holders
entire interests in the Partnership under Section 731 of the Code, with no
gain required to be recognized by the Redeeming OP Unit Holders or the
Partnership as a result thereof, subject to each Redeeming OP Unit Holder
assuming or otherwise guaranteeing a portion of the Redemption Core Property
I Debt and Redemption Core Property II Debt as necessary to avoid income or
gain attributable to any "negative tax capital account" attributable to
such holder. 

   

 (e) Concurrently with the Redemption, the Partnership shall assume and the Company and the Partnership shall indemnify and hold harmless all Redeeming OP Unit Holders from, all liability under debt guarantees, contribution agreements and deficit restoration obligations previously executed by Redeeming OP Unit Holders, to the extent that such guarantee agreements or obligations are related to any debt of the Company, the Partnership or an affiliate of the Company or the Partnership other than the Redemption Core Property I Debt and the Redemption Core Property II Debt. After the REIT Merger, Parent shall guarantee all such obligations. 

   

 (f) At the Redemption Effective Time, the Partnership shall distribute to each Redeeming OP Unit Holder for each Redemption OP Unit an amount in cash equal to $0.505 multiplied by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the number of days between the last day of the last fiscal quarter for which full quarterly dividends on the Redemption OP Units have been declared and paid and the Closing Date (including the Closing Date) by (y) the total number of days in the fiscal quarter during which the Closing Date occurs. 

   

 (g) For purposes of this Agreement: 

   

 "Aggregate Redemption Value" means the product of (A) the aggregate number of Redemption OP Units times (B) $45.25. 

   

 "Qualifying Debt" shall be nonrecourse indebtedness (i) provided by a lender that does not have an interest in TZ OP and is not related to TZ OP (other than as a lender) with the meaning of Section 465 of the Code, and (ii) secured by a Lien on Redemption Core Property I or Redemption Core Property II, as applicable, and each property shall have a value of no less than two times the aggregate amount of the guarantees of the indebtedness of such property executed by Redeeming OP Unit Holders. Indebtedness shall not be Qualifying Debt if and when there is another guarantee (other than a guarantee by a Redeeming OP Unit Holder) of the same portion of such indebtedness guaranteed by the Redeeming OP Unit Holder, except that TZ OP shall be permitted to enter into a guarantee of any such debt so long as in connection with such guarantee, TZ OP offers to the Redeeming OP Unit Holders the opportunity to indemnify and hold TZ OP harmless with respect to TZ OPs guarantee in an amount and on the terms of the Redeeming OP Unit Holders direct liability to the lender under the terms of the Redeeming OP Unit Holders guarantee. 

   

 "Redemption Core Properties" means Redemption Core Property I and Redemption Core Property II.

    ##### 

  

     

 "Redemption Core Property II" means an asset otherwise to be transferred pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement to be identified by TZ OP prior to the Closing, which shall have a Redemption Core Property II Allocated Value greater than or equal to the sum of (A) the Aggregate Redemption Value minus (B) the Redemption Core Property I Net Value. 

   

 "Redemption Core Property II Allocated Value" means value allocated to Redemption Core Property II and mutually agreed upon by TZ OP and the Partnership. 

   

 "Redemption Core Property LLC Interests" means, collectively, the Redemption Core Property I LLC Interests and the Redemption Core Property II LLC Interests. 

   

 "Redemption Core Property I Debt" means the aggregate of any principal and accrued but unpaid interest with respect to any Qualified Debt secured by any Lien on Redemption Core Property I. 

   

 "Redemption Core Property II Debt" means the aggregate of any principal and accrued but unpaid interest with respect to any Qualified Debt secured by any Lien on Redemption Core Property II, and any Redemption Core Property II Debt shall contain commercially reasonable terms, and have a remaining term of at least 2 years at the time of the Redemption or be refinanced with Qualified Debt that is available for guarantee by the Redeeming OP Unit Holders. 

   

 "Redemption Core Property I LLC" means the limited liability company that owns at the Redemption Effective Time all of the Partnerships right, title and interest in Redemption Core Property I. 

   

 "Redemption Core Property II LLC" means the limited liability company that owns at the Redemption Effective Time all of the Partnerships right, title and interest in Redemption Core Property II.

    ##### 

  

    

holders have elected to have redeemed pursuant to this Section 2.02 at the
Redemption Effective Time. 

   

 "Redemption Percentage" means, with respect to each Redeeming OP Unit Holder, a percentage determined by dividing the number of Redemption OP Units held by such holder as of the Redemption Effective Time by the aggregate Redemption OP Units held by all Redeeming OP Unit Holders as of such time. 

   

 SECTION 2.03. Contribution of Redemption Core Properties in Exchange for TZ Units. 

  

 (a) Following the Admission and Redemption and prior to the effective time of any of the other transactions provided for in this Article II, at the Closing, each Redeeming OP Unit Holder shall contribute to TZ OP all of such holders right, title and interest in the Redemption Core Property LLC Interests and shall be admitted as a member of TZ OP and TZ OP agrees to, and shall deliver to such holder, in exchange for such contribution a number of Class B Series II interests in TZ OP (each, a " _TZ Unit_ ") equal to the number of Redemption OP Units such Redeeming OP Unit Holder elected to have redeemed by the Partnership multiplied by the quotient (carried out to four decimal places) determined by dividing $45.25 by the TZ OP Unit Value. For purposes hereof, "TZ OP Unit Value" shall mean $21.89, provided, however, that if the average closing price of a share of common stock of TZ REIT on the New York Stock Exchange for the ten (10) consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the Closing Date (the " _TZ REIT Ten Day Average_ ") is greater than $23.50, or less than $18.89, then the TZ OP Unit Value shall equal the TZ REIT Ten Day Average. The time at which the Exchange closes is referred to herein as the " _Exchange Effective Time_." Each TZ Unit shall entitle such holder (each, an " _Exchanging OP Unit Holder_ ") to the rights, duties and obligations as more fully set forth in the Limited Liability Company Agreement of TZ OP, dated as of December 22, 2004, as amended in connection with the Exchange, and in the applicable Contribution Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement. TZ OP shall be admitted as a member of Redemption Core Property I LLC and Redemption Core Property II LLC and shall hold all legal and beneficial right and title to the membership interests contributed by the Exchanging OP Unit Holders. No fractional TZ Units shall be issued to any Exchanging OP Unit Holder in the Exchange. Instead, the number of TZ Units to be issued to each Exchanging OP Unit Holder in the Exchange shall be rounded to the nearest whole number of TZ Units, with one-half of a TZ Unit being rounded up to a whole TZ Unit. 

   

 (b) If TZ OP changes the number of TZ Units issued and outstanding prior to the Closing Date by way of unit split, recapitalization or similar transaction, the number of TZ Units to be issued in exchange for each Redemption OP Unit shall be proportionately adjusted, as applicable, to reflect such a transaction or transactions. 

   

 (c) At the Exchange Effective Time, each of TZ REIT and TZ OP shall execute and deliver, for the benefit of each Exchanging OP Unit Holder a contribution agreement (the " _Contribution Agreement_ ") and registration rights agreement (the " _Registration Rights Agreement_ "), each of which shall be negotiated in good faith and mutually agreed to by TZ REIT, TZ OP and the Partnership and shall be consistent with and incorporate the terms for such agreements set forth in the term sheet attached hereto as _Exhibit A_. The terms of such 

    ##### 

  

    

Contribution Agreement will govern the maintenance and repayment of the
Redemption Core Property I Debt and the Redemption Core Property II Debt. 

   

 (d) TZ REIT, TZ OP, the Company and the Partnership intend that, for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, the Exchange will be treated as a non-taxable contribution by the Exchanging OP Unit Holders of their interests in Redemption Core Properties to TZ OP in exchange for partnership interests in TZ OP, with no gain required to be recognized by the Exchanging OP Unit Holders as a result thereof, subject to each Exchanging OP Unit Holder continuing to be allocated a portion of the indebtedness of TZ OP as necessary to avoid income or gain attributable to any "negative tax capital account" attributable to such holder. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties acknowledge and agree that the completion of the Exchange is not, and shall not be, a condition of the REIT Merger, the Partnership Merger or the Asset Sale and the parties hereto shall be obligated to consummate the REIT Merger and the Partnership Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,  _provided_ _that_ nothing in this _Section 2.03(e)_ shall relieve any party to this Agreement from any liability resulting from or arising out of any breach of any agreement or covenant hereunder. In the event that the Exchange does not occur due to a breach of any agreement or any covenant by TZ REIT or TZ OP, Exchanging OP Unit Holders shall be paid the Partnership Merger Consideration by Parent and TZ OP shall pay to each Exchanging OP Unit Holder the sum of (i) the amount of taxable income or gain recognized by the Exchanging OP Unit Holder by virtue of the occurrence of the transactions contemplated hereby, multiplied by the maximum combined federal and applicable state and local income tax rates for the related taxable year and applicable to the character of the resulting gain, plus (ii) a "gross-up" amount equal to the taxes (calculated at the rates described above) associated with the payment of the amount described in clause (i) and this clause (ii). TZ REIT and TZ OP shall have no liability for damages arising from such breach of this Agreement other than payment of the foregoing amounts.

The Partnership Merger shall have the effects specified in the MGCL and Section 10-208(j) of the MRULPA.

Parent, the Company and the Partnership intend that, for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, the REIT Merger shall be treated as a taxable sale by the Company of all of its assets to REIT Merger Sub in exchange for the Merger Consideration and the assumption of the Companys liabilities, followed by a liquidating distribution of such Merger Consideration to the holders of the Companys Common Shares, pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code.

a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery of Unit
Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Unit

Certificate shall receive in exchange therefor the Partnership Merger

Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Section 3.03_. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on the Partnership Merger Consideration. 

   

 (e) _Exchange Procedures for Uncertificated Existing Units_.

Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Uncertificated Units shall receive in exchange therefor the Partnership Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Existing Units previously held pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article III_.

Until the procedures set forth in this 

    ##### 

  

    

 _Section 3.03(e)_ have been satisfied, each Uncertificated Unit shall be
deemed at any time after the Partnership Merger Effective Time to represent

The Option Merger Consideration paid with respect to Company Share Options in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to the canceled Company Share Options and on and after the Effective Time the holder of a Company Share Option shall have no further rights with respect to any Company Share Option, other than the right to receive the Option Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(d)_. The Partnership Merger Consideration paid with respect to Existing Units that are exchanged therefor in accordance with the terms of this  _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and privileges pertaining to such Existing Units, and on and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time the holder of any such Existing Unit shall have no further rights with respect to any Existing Unit, other than the right to receive the Partnership Merger Consideration provided under this  _Article III_. 

   

 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares, Company Share Options or Existing Units which were exchanged for the right to receive Partnership Merger Consideration for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Parent and any holders of shares of Company Common Shares, Company Share Options or Existing Units prior to the Mergers who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity and/or the Surviving Partnership for payment of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, the Option Merger Consideration or the Partnership Merger Consideration, as applicable.

 (i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund, as directed by the Surviving Entity, on a daily basis. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments, shall be property of, and paid to, the Surviving Entity.

    ##### 

  

    

Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to make
prompt payments of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, Option
Merger Consideration or Partnership Merger Consideration as contemplated
hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the Exchange
Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such
payments. 

   

 (j) _Lost Certificates or Unit Certificates_. If any Certificate or Unit Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate or Unit Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent reasonably may direct, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Company Common Share Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, or will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Unit Certificate the Partnership Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

conditions of this Agreement with a view to enabling the Company to proceed
with its recommendation to its stockholder without a
Subsequent Determination.

In case, at any time after the Closing, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to cause its respective officers, employees and agents to take all such action. 

     #####

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in connection with any filing or submission required or action to be taken by either Parent or the Company to consummate the Mergers or the Asset Sale, in no event shall Parent or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates be obligated to propose or agree to accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any divestiture or accept any operational restriction, or take or commit to take any action that, in the sole discretion of Parent, could be expected to limit (i) the freedom of action of Parent or its subsidiaries or Affiliates with respect to the operation of, or Parents or its subsidiaries or Affiliates ability to retain, the Company or any businesses, product lines or assets of the Company, or (ii) the ability of Parent to retain, own or operate any portion of the businesses, product lines, or assets, of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates, or alter or restrict in any way the business or commercial practices of the Company, Parent or its subsidiaries or Affiliates.

If any such party or any Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental Authority with respect to the Mergers or the Asset Sale, then such party will endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as possible and after consultation with the other parties, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. 

   

 SECTION 8.06. Public Announcements. 

  

 The parties agree that no public release or announcement concerning the Exchange, the Redemption, the Asset Sale or the Mergers shall be issued by any party without the prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its best efforts to allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. 

   

 SECTION 8.07. Indemnification. 

  

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee, officer, director or other fiduciary may have under any employment or indemnification agreement or under the 

     ##### 

 

    

Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the Partnership Agreement or this
Agreement or, if applicable, similar organization documents or agreements of
any of the Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Time, Parent, the
Surviving Entity and the Surviving Partnership shall (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each person who is now, has been at any time prior to the date
hereof, or is or becomes during the period from the date hereof through the
Effective Time serving as a director or executive officer of the Company, the
Partnership or their Subsidiaries or a fiduciary under or with respect to
any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA)
sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Arden Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted
by applicable law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with
any Claim and any judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement
(including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in
connection with or in respect of such judgments, fines, penalties or amounts
paid in settlement) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of
or, within 30 days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the
Arden Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by
applicable law, as now or hereafter in effect, any Expenses incurred in
defending or serving as a witness with respect to any Claim in advance of the
final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of
or advancement to the Arden Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred by
such Arden Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with
respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without
the requirement of any bond or other security. The indemnification and
advancement obligations pursuant to this _Section 8.07(a)_ shall extend to
acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim
relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring
in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the consideration and
approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any
Claim relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement
conferred hereunder shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, executive officer or other fiduciary of the Company, the Partnership
or their Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of
such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As
used in this _Section 8.07(a)_, (i) the term "Claim" means any threatened,
asserted, pending or completed Action, suit or proceeding, or any inquiry or
investigation of any Governmental Authority or any other party, that any
Arden Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution
of any such Action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other
alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining
to matters that relate to such Arden Indemnified Partys duties or service as
a director or executive officer of the Company, the Partnership, any of their
Subsidiaries, or a fiduciary under any employee benefit plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) sponsored by the Company, and (ii) the term
" _Expenses_ " means reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable
costs, expenses and obligations (including, without limitation, experts
fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating,
printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and
courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with
investigating, defending, being a witness in (including on appeal), or
preparing to investigate, defend or be a witness in any Claim for which
indemnification is authorized pursuant to this _Section 8.07(a)_ , including
any Action relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought
by a Arden Indemnified Party. Neither Parent, the Surviving Entity nor the
Surviving Partnership shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any actual or 

   ##### 

  

  

threatened claim, demand, Action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation
in respect of which indemnification has been or could be sought by such Arden
Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment
includes an unconditional release of such Arden Indemnified Party from
all liability arising out of such claim, demand, Action, suit, proceeding,
inquiry or investigation or such Arden Indemnified Party otherwise consents
thereto. No Arden Indemnified Party shall settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened claim, demand, Action,
suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation in respect of which indemnification
has been or could be sought by such Arden Indemnified Party without the
consent of the Parent. The Surviving Entity and the Surviving Partnership
shall have the right to defend each Arden Indemnified Party in any Action
which may give rise to the payment of indemnification hereunder;
_provided, however_ , that the Surviving Entity or the Surviving Partnership
shall notify such Arden Indemnified Party of any such decision to defend
within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of notice of any such Action.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if in an Action to which an
Arden Indemnified Party is a party and which is indemnifiable hereunder, (I)
such Arden Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that he or she may have
separate defenses or counterclaims to assert with respect to any issue which
may not be consistent with the position of other defendants in such Action,
(II) a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest exists between
such Arden Indemnified Party and the Surviving Entity or the Surviving
Partnership, or (III) if the Surviving Entity or the Surviving
Partnership fails to assume the defense of such Action in a timely manner,
such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be represented by separate legal
counsel of such Indemnified Partys choice at the expense of the Surviving
Entity and the Surviving Partnership. 

  

 (b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and REIT Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable, now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, employees or other agents or fiduciaries of the Company, the Partnership or any of their Subsidiaries as provided in the Company Charter, Company Bylaws and Partnership Agreement (or, as applicable, the charter, bylaws, partnership agreement or other organizational documents of any of the Subsidiaries) and indemnification agreements of the Company, the Partnership or any of their Subsidiaries identified in Section 8.07(b) of the Disclosure Schedule shall be assumed by the Surviving Entity and the Surviving Partnership in the Mergers, without further action, at the Effective Time and Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable, survive the Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. 

   

 (c) The Surviving Entity and the Surviving Partnership shall for a period of six years after the Effective Time cause to be maintained in effect in the Surviving Charter, Surviving Bylaws and Surviving Partnership Agreement (or similar governing documents), provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers and directors and advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries as those currently contained in the Company Charter, Company Bylaws and Partnership Agreement. 

   

 (d) The Surviving Entity and the Surviving Partnership shall maintain for a period of at least six years the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of 

     ##### 

  

    

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ _that_ (i) the
Surviving Entity may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the
aggregate, no less advantageous to the insured, provided that
such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses of coverage with respect
to matters occurring before the Effective Time; (ii) in no event shall the
Surviving Entity or the Surviving Partnership be required to expend, pursuant
to the provisions of this _Section 8.07(d),_ more than an amount per year of
coverage equal to two hundred percent (200%) of current annual premiums,
and (iii) the provisions of this _Section 8.07(d)_ shall be deemed to have
been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained by the Surviving Entity
for purposes of this _Section 8.07_ , which policies (together with the
Companys existing policy) provide such directors and officers with the
coverage described in this _Section 8.07(d)_ for an aggregate period of
not less than six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, without limitation,
in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event
that but for clause (ii) of the proviso in the preceding sentence, the
Company would be required to expend more than two hundred percent (200%) of
the current annual premiums, the Company shall obtain the maximum amount of
such insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to two hundred
percent (200%) of current annual premiums. 

   

 (e) If either the Surviving Entity or the Surviving Partnership or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity or the Surviving Partnership assume the obligations of the Surviving Entity, or the Surviving Partnership, as the case may be set forth in this _Section 8.07_. The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees the payment and performance of the Surviving Entitys and the Surviving Partnerships obligations pursuant to this  _Section 8.07_. 

   

 (f) The provisions of this _Section 8.07_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this _Section 8.07_ applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives. 

   

 SECTION 8.08. Employee Benefit Matters. 

  

 (a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, continue to provide immediately following the Effective Time benefits under the Plans which are "employee benefit plans" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA which cover employees of the Company and each Subsidiary generally and which are in effect at the Effective Time as well as the Plans (other than equity compensation plans) which are in effect at the Effective Time and which cover employees of the Company and each Subsidiary generally (collectively, the " _Company Plans_ ") to the employees of the Surviving Entity at the Effective Time (the " _Company Employees_ ") or Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, provide benefits under plans which provide benefits which are comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided under the Company Plans (collectively, the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ "). If any Company Employees participate in any Parent Benefit Plans following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving 

     ##### 

  

    

Entity to, (i) recognize all service of the Company Employees with the

any such Parent Benefit Plan to the extent such services were recognized
under any corresponding Company Plan, (ii) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Company Employees
under any Parent Benefit Plans which are welfare benefit plans that such
employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, other

to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective
Time under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan and (iii) provide each
Company Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to the Effective Time under any Company Benefit Plans in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any
corresponding Parent Benefit Plan in which such employees are eligible to
participate in immediately following the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to assume and honor in accordance with their terms all employment, severance and termination plans and agreements (including change-in-control provisions) of employees or independent contractors of the Company and the Subsidiaries listed in Section 4.09(a) of the Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 (c) For a period of not less than eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, for the Company Employees who remain employees of the Surviving Entity, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to, maintain benefits (including, without limitation, group health, life, disability and severance plans) that are not less favorable in the aggregate than the benefits provided under the Company Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_") of Company Common Shares or Company Share Options pursuant to this Agreement and the Mergers shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.

If a holder of Partnership Units fails to return a duly completed Form of Election within the time period specified above, such holder shall be deemed to have elected to convert each of such holders Partnership Units into the right to receive the Partnership Merger Consideration upon the conversion thereof in the Partnership Merger. TZ REIT, TZ OP, Parent and the Company by mutual agreement shall have the right to make rules, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing the validity of Forms of Election and the issuance and delivery of the TZ Units, as applicable.

 This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Effective Time in writing (the date of any such termination, the " _Termination Date_ "): 

   

 (a) by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Company. 

   

 (b) by either the Company or Parent by written notice to the other party if any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction over such matters shall have issued a governmental order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting either of the Mergers, and such governmental order shall have become final and unappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the terms of this  _Section 10.01(b)_ shall not be available to any party unless, subject to the provisions of  _Section 8.05(c)_, such party shall have used its reasonable best efforts to oppose any such governmental order or to have such governmental order vacated or made inapplicable to the Mergers. 

     ##### 

  

     

 (c) by either the Company or Parent, by written notice to the other party if the Mergers shall not have been consummated on or before June 30, 2006 (the " _Expiration Date_ "), unless the failure to consummate the Mergers on or prior to such date is the result of any action or inaction in violation of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate the Agreement pursuant to the terms of this _Section 10.01(c)_. 

   

 (d) by the Company or Parent if the Company Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 (g) by Parent upon written notice from Parent to the Company, if the Company or the Partnership breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 9.02(a)_ or _9.02(b)_ and such condition is not satisfied (or is incapable of being satisfied) by the Expiration Date. 

   

 (h) by the Company upon written notice from the Company to the Parent, if the Parent or REIT Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Sections 9.03(a)_ or _9.03(b)_ and such condition is not satisfied (or is incapable of being satisfied) by the Expiration Date. 

   

 SECTION 10.02. Effect of Termination. 

  

 In the event of termination of this Agreement and abandonment of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 10.01_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of no further force or effect whatsoever and there shall be no liability on the part of any party, or their respective officers, directors, subsidiaries or partners, as applicable, to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any party to this Agreement from any liability resulting from or arising out of any breach of any agreement or covenant hereunder;  _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the covenants and other obligations under this Agreement shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement, except that the agreements set forth in _Section 8.03(c)_, _Section 8.03(d)_, _Section 8.06_ , _Section 10.03_, _Section 11.08_ and _Section 11.09_ shall survive termination indefinitely.

     ##### 

  

     

 SECTION 10.03. Fees and Expenses. 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise explicitly set forth in this _Section 10.03_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated; provided, however, that (i) Parent shall pay any filing fees required in connection with filings under the HSR Act and (ii) the Company shall pay the expenses related to printing, filing and mailing the Proxy Statement (and any amendments or supplements thereto) and all SEC and other regulatory filing fees (if any) incurred in connection with the Proxy Statement.

 (ii) by the Parent pursuant to _Section 10.01(e)(ii)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section 10.01(f)_, then the Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent on the Termination Date if terminated pursuant to _Section 10.01(f)_ or within three (3) days following the Termination Date if terminated pursuant to _Section 10.01(e)(ii)_; or

 (c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 10.01(h)_, Parent shall pay to the Company within three (3) Business Days after the date of termination all documented, reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers, accountants, consultants, financial advisors and investment bankers, incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the entering into of this Agreement and the carrying out of any and all acts contemplated hereunder up to an aggregate maximum amount of $10.0 million.

financial advisors, and investment bankers, incurred by Parent in connection
with the entering into of this Agreement and the carrying out of any and all
acts contemplated hereunder up to an aggregate maximum amount of $10.0
million (the " _Parent Expenses_ "). The payment of expenses set forth in
this  _Section 10.03(c)_ is not an exclusive remedy, but is in addition to
any other rights or remedies available to the parties hereto (whether at law
or in equity), and in no respect is intended by the parties hereto to
constitute liquidated damages, or be viewed as an indicator of the damages
payable, or in any other respect limit or restrict damages available in case
of any breach of this Agreement. 

   

 (d) In the event that either Parent or the Company is required to file suit to seek all or a portion of the amounts payable under this _Section 10.03_, and such party prevails in such litigation, such party shall be entitled to all expenses, including attorneys fees and expenses, which it has incurred in enforcing its rights under this _Section 10.03_ .
