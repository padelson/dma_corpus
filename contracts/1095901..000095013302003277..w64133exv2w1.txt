AGREEMENT   THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of
August 12, 2002, by and among VERIDIAN Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Purchaser"), Roger Mody, an individual resident in Virginia,
and Lori Mody, an individual resident in Virginia (collectively, the
"Sellers") and, for the purposes set forth in Section 1.2.3 and Article 4,
SIGNAL Corporation, a Virginia corporation ("SIGNAL"). An index of defined
terms is set forth in Section 11.1 and capitalized terms not elsewhere
defined are defined in Section 11.2.   R E C I T A L S   WHEREAS, Sellers
own all of the outstanding shares of capital  stock of SIGNAL, and Roger Mody
owns one percent (1%) of the membership  interests of SIGNAL Services LLC, a
Virginia limited liability company  ("SIGNAL LLC" and, together with SIGNAL,
collectively, the "SIGNAL  Companies" and each a "SIGNAL Company"); and  
WHEREAS, SIGNAL owns ninety-nine percent (99%) of the  membership interests
of SIGNAL LLC (the "LLC Interests"); and   WHEREAS, the SIGNAL Companies
together provide services in the  areas of information technology and related
services to federal and  commercial customers (the "Business"); and  
WHEREAS, prior to the Closing Date, Roger Mody will sell his  membership
interest in SIGNAL LLC to SIGNAL; and   WHEREAS, Purchaser desires to
purchase all of the outstanding  shares of capital stock of SIGNAL (the
"Shares") from Sellers and  Sellers desire to sell the Shares to Purchaser,
on the terms and  subject to the conditions herein contained.   NOW,
THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the  receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties  agree as follows:   ARTICLE
1  PURCHASE AND SALE OF OWNERSHIP INTERESTS; PURCHASE PRICE;  CLOSING  
1.1 AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE AND SELL.   On the basis of the representations,
warranties, covenants, and agreements, and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth herein, at the Closing each of the Sellers
will sell and transfer to Purchaser, and Purchaser will acquire from each of
the Sellers, the Shares, free and clear of all Claims. The total
consideration to be paid by Purchaser in connection with the acquisition of
the Shares shall be the sum of the payments described in Section 1.2 below
(collectively, the "Purchase Price").         1.2 CONSIDERATION.  
1.2.1 Cash Payments at Closing. A portion of the Purchase Price equal to
$187,426,000 less the sum of (i) the total amount due on the Remley Notes as
of the Closing Date; (ii) the total amount set forth on Schedule 1.2.4; and
(iii) and any adjustment required under Section 1.3 (the "Initial
Cash Payment") shall be paid to Sellers at the Closing by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to such bank account(s) as Sellers shall
designate by written notice delivered to Purchaser not later than five (5)
business days prior to the Closing. The Remley Notes shall be prepaid and
satisfied in full at the Closing by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such bank account(s) as Sellers shall designate by written notice
delivered to Purchaser not later than five (5) business days prior to the
Closing.   1.2.2 Subordinated Notes. A portion of the Purchase Price shall
be paid at the Closing by the issuance and delivery of one senior
subordinated note to each of the Sellers (the "Notes"), which notes shall
have, in the aggregate, a principal amount of $25,000,000 and otherwise be in
the form attached as Exhibit A to the form of Note Purchase Agreement
attached hereto as Exhibit 1.2.2 (the "Note Agreement"). Sellers acknowledge
and agree that the covenants set forth in the Note Agreement are intended to
conform substantially to the covenants contained in Credit Facility proposed
to be entered into by Purchaser in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Senior Covenants") except for the numerical amounts
that are intended to be less restrictive on Purchaser than those contained in
the Credit Facility by 20%. If and to the extent that the proposed Senior
Covenants are changed in the final Credit Facility, Sellers agree that the
covenants in the Note Agreement will be modified to conform to the Senior
Covenants in such final Credit Facility except for the numerical amounts
which will be less restrictive on Purchaser than those contained in the
Senior Covenants by 20%.   1.2.3 Officer Bonuses. Sellers, SIGNAL and
Purchaser mutually agree that, for the benefit of certain officers of SIGNAL
(the "Officers") and in consideration of services previously provided to
SIGNAL by such Officers in accordance with the terms of the bonus agreements
with such Officers, SIGNAL shall pay the bonus payments totaling $7,574,000
in the aggregate and individually as set forth on Exhibit 1.2.3 (the "Officer
Bonus Amounts"), immediately after the Closing. Purchaser agrees to guarantee
the satisfaction by SIGNAL of its obligations to pay the Officer Bonus
Amounts as set forth in this Section 1.2.3. Payments of any Officer Bonus
Amount shall be in cash, less applicable withholding taxes.   1.2.4
Transaction Fees. Immediately prior to the Closing, Sellers will provide
Schedule 1.2.4 to Purchaser showing the total amount of unpaid legal,
accounting and investment banking fees as of the Closing Date incurred by the
SIGNAL Companies in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Signal shall promptly pay these amounts following the
Closing.   1.2.5 Allocation of Consideration. Sellers shall distribute
the Initial Cash Payment and the Notes among themselves in accordance with
their respective ownership of the Shares ("Pro Rata Portion"), or as they
may otherwise agree, and Purchaser shall have no duty or liability with
respect to the distribution of such amounts between Sellers.    2    
1.3 ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PURCHASE PRICE.   The Purchase Price will be reduced
by the amount by which the total amount of borrowings of the SIGNAL Companies
outstanding under the Line of Credit immediately prior to Closing exceeds
$5,000,000.   1.4 TIME AND PLACE OF CLOSING.   The transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be consummated (the "Closing") at 10:00
a.m., at the offices of Andrews and Kurth L.L.P., 1701 Pennsylvania Avenue,
N.W., Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 20006-5805, on September 30, 2002 or as
soon thereafter as practicable (and in any event within three business days)
after the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions set forth in
Sections 5.1 and 5.2, or on such other date, or at such time or place, as
shall be mutually agreed upon by Sellers and Purchaser. The date on which
the Closing occurs in accordance with the preceding sentence is referred to
in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."   ARTICLE 2  REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF SELLERS    2.1 GENERAL STATEMENT.   Sellers jointly and
severally make the representations and warranties set forth in this Article
2. All such representations and warranties have been made to induce Purchaser
to enter into this Agreement, shall survive the Closing in accordance with
Article 8 (and none shall merge into any instrument of conveyance) and shall
not be limited or otherwise affected by any investigation or lack of
investigation by Purchaser. No specific representation or warranty shall
limit the generality or applicability of a more general representation
or warranty. Representations and warranties of Sellers are initially made as
of the date hereof. All representations and warranties of Sellers are made
subject to the exceptions noted in the schedule delivered by Sellers to
Purchaser concurrently herewith and identified as the "Sellers\' Disclosure
Schedule." Except for those representations and warranties expressly set
forth in this Article 2, neither Seller makes any representations or
warranties, express or implied, at law or in equity, of any kind or nature
whatsoever concerning the organization, business, assets, Liabilities and
operations of the SIGNAL Companies and any such other representations or
warranties are hereby expressly disclaimed in full and for all time.   2.2
CORPORATE   2.2.1 The execution and delivery by Sellers of this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents to be executed by them, will, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by Purchaser, constitute
the legal, valid and binding obligations of Sellers, enforceable against
Sellers in accordance with their respective terms (except to the extent that
enforcement may be affected by laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency and creditors\' rights generally and by the availability of
injunctive relief, specific performance and other equitable remedies).
Sellers have the right, power, authority and capacity to execute and deliver
this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and to perform their obligations
under this Agreement and the Transaction Documents.       3    2.2.2
Except for the HSR Clearance or as set forth in Section 2.2.2 of Sellers\'
Disclosure Schedule, no Approval of any Governmental Authority is required
for the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.   2.2.3 Except as set forth in Section 2.2.3 of Sellers\'
Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the other Transaction Documents nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby will conflict with or result in a Breach of
any Restriction or require any waiver, approval or consent of any Person.
Excluded from the foregoing are such conflicts or Breaches (other than
conflicts or Breaches of any articles of incorporation or association, bylaws
or other organizational documents) that, and waivers, approvals or consents
the failure of which to obtain, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect on the SIGNAL Companies taken as a whole.  
2.2.4 Sellers are not a party to any unexpired, undisclosed or undisputed
Contract under the terms of which performance by Sellers according to the
terms of this Agreement will require any notice to any Person, whether before
or after Closing. Excluded from the foregoing are such notices the failure of
which to make would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on the SIGNAL Companies taken as a whole.   2.2.5 Each SIGNAL
Company is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, and has the requisite
power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. All jurisdictions in
which the SIGNAL Companies are incorporated or formed are set forth in
Section 2.2.5 of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule.   2.2.6 Each SIGNAL Company
is qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing under
the laws of all jurisdictions where the nature of its business or the nature
or location of its assets requires such qualification, except where the
failure to be so qualified and in good standing will not, when taken together
with all other such failures, have a Material Adverse Effect on the SIGNAL
Companies taken as a whole. All jurisdictions in which the SIGNAL Companies
are qualified as a foreign entity are set forth in Section 2.2.6 of Sellers\'
Disclosure Schedule.   2.2.7 Except for the LLC Interests, no SIGNAL Company
owns or has the right to acquire, directly or indirectly, a majority of the
voting securities or equity interests of any Person or hold or beneficially
own any other direct or indirect interest (whether it be common or preferred
stock or any comparable ownership interest in any Person that is not a
corporation), or any subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, calls,
convertible securities or other agreements or commitments for any interest in
any Person.   2.2.8 True and complete copies of the Articles of
Incorporation and all amendments thereto, the bylaws as amended and currently
in force, all stock records, and all corporate minute books and records of
SIGNAL have been furnished for inspection by Purchaser. Said stock records
accurately reflect all stock transactions and the current stock ownership of
the stock of SIGNAL. The corporate minute books and records of SIGNAL contain
true and complete copies     4    of all resolutions adopted by the
shareholders or the board of directors of SIGNAL and any other action
formally taken by it as such.   2.2.9 True and complete copies of the
Articles of Organization and all amendments thereto, the limited liability
company agreement as amended and currently in force, all membership records,
and all minute books and records of SIGNAL LLC have been furnished for
inspection by Purchaser. Said membership records accurately reflect all
transactions in membership interests and the current ownership of SIGNAL LLC.
The minute books and records of SIGNAL LLC contain true and complete copies
of all resolutions adopted by the members or the managers of SIGNAL LLC and
any other action formally taken by such members or managers.   2.2.10 The
authorized and issued and outstanding capital stock of SIGNAL is set out in
Section 2.2.10 of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule. There are no shares of
capital stock of SIGNAL of any other class authorized, issued or outstanding.
All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of SIGNAL has been duly
authorized and is validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Sellers
own all of the issued and outstanding Shares of SIGNAL, free and clear of
all Claims. There are no Claims relating to the issued or unissued capital
stock or other securities of SIGNAL or obligating SIGNAL to issue any
securities of any kind.   2.2.11 All outstanding membership interests of
SIGNAL LLC are set out in Section 2.2.11 of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule.
All of the outstanding membership interests of SIGNAL LLC have been duly
authorized. As of the Closing Date, SIGNAL will own one hundred percent
(100%) of the outstanding membership interests of SIGNAL LLC, free and clear
of all Claims except as set forth in Section 2.2.11 of Sellers\' Disclosure
Schedule. There are no Claims relating to the membership interests or other
securities of SIGNAL LLC or obligating SIGNAL LLC to issue any securities of
any kind.   2.3 FINANCIAL   2.3.1 The SIGNAL Companies have made and kept
books, accounts and records which, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the activities of the SIGNAL Companies.   2.3.2 Section
2.3.2 of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule contains complete and accurate copies
of the audited consolidated balance sheets, statements of income and retained
earnings, statements of cash flows and notes to financial statements
(together with any supplementary information thereto) of SIGNAL and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2001,
2000 and 1999 (the "Audited Financial Statements") and the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet, statement of income and statement of
cash flows of SIGNAL as of and for the period ended June 30, 2002 (the
"Unaudited Financial Statements"). SIGNAL\'s unaudited consolidated balance
sheet as of June 30, 2002 is hereinafter referenced as the "Interim Balance
Sheet." The Audited Financial Statements and the Unaudited Financial
Statements are hereinafter referred to as the "Financial Statements." The
Financial Statements are complete and correct in all material respects and
present fairly the consolidated financial position of SIGNAL and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the date thereof and their consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods covered by such
statements, in     5    accordance with U.S. GAAP, consistently
applied; except, with respect to the Unaudited Financial Statements, for (x)
the absence of footnote disclosures required by U.S. GAAP and (y) normal
recurring year-end adjustments which are not material, individually or in the
aggregate. SIGNAL has furnished to Purchaser complete and correct copies of
all attorneys\' responses to audit inquiry letters and all management letters
from the SIGNAL Companies\' independent certified public accountants for the
last three (3) fiscal years.   2.3.3 None of the trade receivables and notes
receivable which are reflected in the Interim Balance Sheet or which arose
subsequent to June 30, 2002 is or was subject to any deduction, counterclaim
or set-off. All of such trade receivables arose out of bona fide, arms-length
transactions for the sale of goods or performance of services, and all such
trade receivables and notes receivable (whether billed or unbilled) are
collectible (or have been collected) in the ordinary course of business at
the aggregate recorded amounts thereof, less the amount of applicable
reserves for doubtful accounts and for allowances and discounts. All such
reserves, allowances and discounts were and are adequate and consistent in
extent with reserves, allowances and discounts previously maintained by the
SIGNAL Companies in the ordinary course of business. The SIGNAL Companies
have no outstanding sales on consignment, sales on approval, sales on return
or guaranteed sales.   2.3.4 Neither SIGNAL Company has any Inventory.  
2.3.5 To Sellers\' knowledge, on the date of this Agreement, the Funded
Customer Backlog of the SIGNAL Companies is not less than the
amount specified in Section 2.3.5 of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule. As used
in this Agreement, the term "Funded Customer Backlog" means (i) purchase
orders or Contracts with the U.S. Government for which the U.S. Government
has appropriated funds or (ii) firm commercial purchaser orders or Contracts.
The amount of Funded Customer Backlog includes backlog amounts representing
approved at-risk work consistent with past practice but not in excess of
$8,000,000. Sellers make no representation as to whether such Funded Customer
Backlog shall ever result in the recognition of revenue.   2.3.6 The SIGNAL
Companies have no material Liabilities except for:   (a) Liabilities
provided for or reserved against in the  Financial Statements;   (b)
Liabilities which have been incurred by either SIGNAL  Company subsequent to
June 30, 2002 in the ordinary course of such  SIGNAL Company\'s business and
consistent with past practice;   (c) Liabilities under the executory portion
of any  Contract by which either SIGNAL Company is bound and which was
entered  into in the ordinary course of such SIGNAL Company\'s business and 
consistent with past practice;   (d) Liabilities under the executory portion
of Approvals  and Environmental Permits issued to, or entered into by, either
SIGNAL  Company in the ordinary course of business;    6      (e)
Liabilities expressly permitted or contemplated by  this Agreement (including
Liabilities arising as a result of the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement); and   (f) Liabilities disclosed in Section 2.3.6(f) of
Sellers\'  Disclosure Schedule.   2.3.7 Section 2.3.7 of Sellers\'
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, accurate and complete list and
description of all uncompleted Contracts of the SIGNAL Companies as of the
date hereof, which, individually, provide for additional payments to the
SIGNAL Companies of more than $50,000, and all outstanding bids, including
Government Bids, of the SIGNAL Companies as of the date hereof which have not
been accepted by customers and which, individually, related to the sale of
goods or performance of services for which the SIGNAL Companies are
reasonably likely to receive more than $50,000 if such bids are accepted. To
Sellers\' knowledge, no facts or conditions exist with respect to any such
Contract which will result in a loss to a SIGNAL Company in an amount in
excess of $50,000. All outstanding bids were made in the ordinary course
of business in a manner consistent with past practice. There is no reason
known to Sellers to believe the SIGNAL Companies\' outstanding bids or
prospects for future bids will be adversely affected by the transactions
contemplated hereby.   2.3.8 The SIGNAL Companies have good and marketable
title to their respective assets shown on the Interim Balance Sheet, free and
clear of any Liens, except for Liens set forth on Section 2.3.8 of Sellers\'
Disclosure Schedule, Permitted Liens and assets disposed of since June 30,
2002, in the ordinary course of business in a manner consistent with past
practice. No unreleased Security Document encumbering any of the SIGNAL
Companies\' assets has been recorded, filed, executed or delivered.   2.3.9
Section 2.3.9 of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule contains a true, accurate and
complete list and description (including coverages, deductibles
and expiration dates) of all insurance policies which are owned by the
SIGNAL Companies or which name either of the SIGNAL Companies as an insured
(or loss payee), including without limitation those which pertain to the
SIGNAL Companies\' assets, employees or operations, and the claims history
for the past three (3) years under each of such policies. All such insurance
policies are in full force and effect and neither SIGNAL Company has received
notice of cancellation of any such insurance policies. In the three (3) year
period ending on the date hereof, neither SIGNAL Company has received any
notice from, or on behalf of, any insurance carrier relating to or involving
any change in conditions of insurance that was adverse to the SIGNAL
Companies or any refusal to issue an insurance policy or non-renewal of a
policy.   2.3.10 Section 2.3.10 of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule contains a
list showing:   (a) the name of each bank, safe deposit company or other 
financial institution in which either SIGNAL Company has an account,  lock
box or safe deposit box;   (b) the names of all Persons authorized to draw
thereon  or to have access thereto and the names of all Persons, if any,
holding  powers of attorney from either SIGNAL Company; and    
7      (c) all surety bonds, instruments or agreements to which  either
SIGNAL Company is a party as an endorser, surety or guarantor,  other than
checks endorsed for collection or deposit in the ordinary  course of
business.   2.3.11 Section 2.3.11 of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule describes
each: (i) Contract or other business relationship (excluding employee
compensation and other ordinary incidents of employment) between (x) either
SIGNAL Company and (y) any Related Party; (ii) transaction occurring since
January 1, 1999 between either SIGNAL Company and any Related Party; and
(iii) amount owing by or to any of the Related Parties, respectively, to or
from either SIGNAL Company as of the date of this Agreement. No property or
interest in any property which is used in the current operations of the
SIGNAL Companies is owned by or leased or licensed by or to any Related
Party. Prior to the Closing Date, all amounts due and owing to or from either
SIGNAL Company by or to any of the Related Parties (excluding the Remley
Notes, the Officer Bonus Amounts, employee compensation and other ordinary
incidents of employment) shall be paid in full. To Sellers\' knowledge, no
Related Party has an interest, directly or indirectly, in any
business, corporate or otherwise, which is in competition with either SIGNAL
Company\'s respective businesses.   2.4 TAXES.   2.4.1 As used in this
Agreement, the following terms shall have the following meanings:   (a) the
term "Taxes" means all federal, state, local,  foreign and other net income,
gross income, gross receipts, sales, use,  ad valorem, transfer, franchise,
profits, license, lease, service,  service use, value added, withholding,
payroll, employment, excise,  severance, stamp, occupation, premium,
property, windfall profits,  customs, duties or other taxes or similar
government charges of any  kind whatever, together with any interest and any
penalties, additions  to tax or additional amounts with respect thereto, and
the term "Tax"  means any one of the foregoing Taxes;   (b) the term "Tax
Returns" means all returns,  declarations, reports, statements, elections and
other documents  required to be filed in respect of Taxes, and the term "Tax
Return"  means any one of the foregoing Tax Returns; and   (c) the term
"Code" means the Internal Revenue Code of  1986, as amended from time to
time. All citations to the Code, or to  the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, shall include any  amendments or any substitute or successor
provisions thereto.   2.4.2 Each SIGNAL Company has filed with the
appropriate taxing authorities all material Tax Returns required to have been
filed by such SIGNAL Company. Each such Tax Return is true, correct and
complete in all material respects. All Taxes of Sellers and the SIGNAL
Companies that are required to have been paid (whether or not shown on any
Tax Return) have been paid in full. Section 2.4.2 of Sellers\' Disclosure
Schedule lists with respect to the three preceding taxable periods all Tax
Returns not timely filed with the appropriate taxing authorities and all
Taxes that have not been timely paid in full.      8     2.4.3 Except
as provided in Section 2.4.3 of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule, no issues have
been raised in writing (and are currently pending) by any taxing authority in
connection with any of the SIGNAL Company Tax Returns, and neither Sellers
nor any director or officer (or employee responsible for Tax matters) of
either SIGNAL Company has knowledge of any such issues based upon personal
contact with any agent of any such authority. No waivers of statutes
of limitation with respect to the Tax Returns have been given by or requested
from either SIGNAL Company. There are no Liens on any of the assets of either
SIGNAL Company that arose in connection with any failure (or alleged failure)
to pay any Tax (not including Liens for Taxes not yet due). All Tax
deficiencies asserted or assessments made as a result of any examinations
have been fully paid, or are fully reflected as a liability in the Financial
Statements, or are being contested and an adequate reserve therefor has been
established in the Financial Statements.   2.4.4 Each SIGNAL Company has
complied in all respects with all Applicable Laws relating to the withholding
of Taxes and has, within the time and manner prescribed by law, withheld and
paid over to the proper taxing authorities all amounts required to have been
withheld and paid over under all Applicable Laws.   2.4.5 Except as
provided in Section 2.4.5 of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule, neither SIGNAL
Company is a party to or bound by any Tax indemnity, Tax sharing or Tax
allocation agreement for any Tax on or related to income.   2.4.6 Except as
provided in Section 2.4.6 of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule, neither SIGNAL
Company has ever been a member of an affiliated group of corporations other
than such affiliated group of which SIGNAL is the parent corporation, within

2.7.1   (a) Neither SIGNAL nor any Affiliate of SIGNAL as  determined under
Code Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) (an "ERISA  Affiliate") maintains,
administers or contributes to any: (i) employee  pension benefit plan (as
defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA")) (a  "Plan"), including any multiemployer plan as
defined in Section 3(37)  of ERISA ("Multiemployer Plan"); (ii) employee
welfare benefit plan (as  defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) (a "Welfare
Plan"); or (iii) bonus,  deferred compensation, stock purchase, stock option,
severance, salary  continuation, vacation, sick leave, fringe benefit,
incentive,  insurance,      14      welfare or similar plan or
arrangement (an "Employee Benefit Plan")  other than those Plans, Welfare
Plans and Employee Benefit Plans  described in Section 2.7.1 of Sellers\'
Disclosure Schedule. Except as  required by Section 4980B of the Code, Part 6
of Subtitle B of Title I  of ERISA or applicable state law, neither SIGNAL
nor any ERISA  Affiliate has promised any former employee or other individual
not  employed by SIGNAL or any ERISA Affiliate medical or life insurance 
coverage and neither SIGNAL nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains or  contributes
to any plan or arrangement providing medical or life  insurance benefits to
former employees or their dependents, other than  benefits provided in the
event of disability and conversion privileges.  Each Plan, Welfare Plan and
Employee Benefit Plan is considered to be a  "Benefit Plan." With respect to
each Benefit Plan:   (i) Each Benefit Plan complies, in form and  operation
with all applicable statutes, laws and regulations,  including ERISA and the
Code and has been administered in all  material respects in accordance with
its terms.   (ii) Any Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify  under
Section 401(a) of the Code meets in all respects all  requirements for
qualification under Section 401(a) of the  Code and the regulations
thereunder, except for failures which  may be corrected under the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS")  Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System without
material  cost. Each Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under  Section
401(a) of the Code has been the subject of a  "Favorable Letter" as such term
is defined in IRS Rev. Proc.  2002-47, or can still be submitted in a timely
manner to the  IRS for such letter, and no such determination letter has
been  revoked nor, to Sellers\' knowledge, has revocation of any such 
letter been threatened, nor has any such Benefit Plan been  amended since the
date of such Favorable Letter in any respect  that would adversely affect its
qualification or increase its  costs. All amendments required to be adopted
before the  Closing Date for any such Benefit Plan to continue to be so 
qualified have been or will be duly and timely adopted.   (iii) Except for
any such failure that would not  result in a material Liability to a SIGNAL
Company, all  reports and information relating to each such Benefit Plan 
required to be filed with any governmental entity have been  accurately and
timely filed; all reports and information  relating to each such Benefit Plan
required to be disclosed or  provided to participants or their beneficiaries
have been  timely disclosed or provided; each trust related to any  Benefit
Plan which is a "voluntary employees\' beneficiary  association" pursuant to
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code has  received a favorable determination letter
from the IRS with  respect to its tax-exempt status, and nothing has
occurred  since the date of such letter that has or is likely to  adversely
affect such qualification or exemption; there exist  no restrictions on
Purchaser\'s right to terminate or decrease  prospectively the level of
benefits under any Benefit Plan  after the Closing Date without liability to
any employee or  former employee of either SIGNAL Company; to Sellers\' 
knowledge, no fiduciary of any Benefit Plan has committed a  breach of any
responsibility or obligation imposed upon  fiduciaries under Title I of ERISA
with respect to such  Benefit Plan.    15      (iv) There has been
delivered or made available  to Purchaser, with respect to each Benefit Plan,
the  following: a copy of the annual report (if required under  ERISA) with
respect to each such Benefit Plan for the last  three (3) years (including
all schedules and attachments); a  copy of the summary plan description,
together with each  summary of material modifications, required under ERISA
with  respect to such Benefit Plan; all material employee  communications
relating to such Benefit Plan; a true and  complete copy of such Benefit
Plan; all trust agreements,  insurance contracts, accounts or other documents
which  establish the funding vehicle for any Benefit Plan and the  latest
financial statements thereof; and any investment  management agreements,
administrative services contracts, or  other agreements and documents
relating to the ongoing  administration and investment of any Benefit
Plan.   (v) There are no actions, suits, Proceedings,  investigations or
hearings pending with respect to any Benefit  Plan, or to Sellers\' knowledge
any claims (other than claims  for benefits arising in the ordinary course of
any Benefit  Plan) threatened against or with respect to any Benefit Plan 
or any fiduciary or assets thereof, and, to Sellers\'  knowledge, there are
no facts which could reasonably give rise  to any such actions, suits,
Proceedings, investigations,  hearings or claims.   (b) Each Welfare Plan
which is a group health plan  (within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of
the Code) complies with  and has been maintained and operated in material
compliance with each  of the requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and
Part 6 of Subtitle  B of Title I of ERISA.   (c) Neither SIGNAL Company
will incur any liability under  any Benefit Plan solely on account of the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated hereby, alone or together with
any other  event. Each Benefit Plan is terminable at the discretion of SIGNAL
in  accordance with its terms and without material cost to SIGNAL. No 
Benefit Plan has any provision, other than those required by law, which 
could increase or accelerate benefits or any provision which could  increase
liability as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby,  alone or
together with any other event. Neither SIGNAL nor any ERISA  Affiliate nor
any officer, director, agent or employee of SIGNAL or any  ERISA Affiliate
has made any oral or written statement regarding any  Benefit Plan which
could result in liability in excess of that set  forth in the Benefit
Plan.   (d) No withdrawals have occurred so as to cause any  Benefit Plan
to become subject to the provisions of Section 4063 of  ERISA, nor has SIGNAL
or any ERISA Affiliate ceased making  contributions to any Benefit Plan
subject to Section 4064(a) of ERISA  to which SIGNAL or any ERISA Affiliate
made contributions during the  six (6) years prior to the date hereof.  
(e) Neither SIGNAL nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred  any liability to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") as a  result of the voluntary
or involuntary termination of any Benefit Plan  which is subject to Title IV
of ERISA. There is currently no active  filing by SIGNAL or any ERISA
Affiliate with the PBGC (and no       16      Proceeding has been
commenced by the PBGC) to terminate any Benefit  Plan which is subject to
Title IV of ERISA and which has been  maintained or funded, in whole or in
part, by SIGNAL or any ERISA  Affiliate.   (f) Neither any Benefit Plan
fiduciary nor any Benefit  Plan has engaged in any transaction in violation
of Section 406 of  ERISA or any non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (as
defined in Section  4975(c)(1) of the Code) and there has been no "reportable
event" (as  defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) with respect to any Benefit
Plan.  Neither SIGNAL nor any ERISA Affiliate has failed to make any 
contributions or to pay any amounts due and owing as required by the  terms
of any Benefit Plan or collective bargaining agreement or ERISA  or any other
Applicable Law. Full payment has been made as of the date  hereof, and will
have been made or accrued as of the Closing Date, of  all amounts which
SIGNAL or any ERISA Affiliate is required or  committed to pay to the Benefit
Plans.   (g) Neither SIGNAL nor any ERISA Affiliate sponsors or 
contributes or has ever sponsored or contributed to a Multiemployer  Plan or
any Benefit Plan that is or at any time was subject to minimum  funding
requirements or Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA  or Title IV
of ERISA.   2.7.2   (a) With respect to employees of each SIGNAL
Company,  except as contemplated by or permitted herein:   (i) No employee
of either SIGNAL Company is a  party to, or is otherwise bound by, any
agreement, including  any confidentiality, noncompetition or proprietary
rights  agreement, between such employee and such SIGNAL Company or,  to
Sellers\' knowledge, any other Person that materially and  adversely affects
or will affect: (1) the performance of that  employee\'s duties as an
employee of such SIGNAL Company; or  (2) the ability of such SIGNAL Company
to conduct its business  following the Closing. To Sellers\' knowledge, no
officer or  other key employee of such SIGNAL Company intends to terminate 
employment with such SIGNAL Company prior to, upon, or shortly  after the
Closing of the transactions contemplated hereby.   (ii) Such SIGNAL Company
is not a party to, nor  has it ever been a party to, any collective
bargaining  agreement. There has not been, there is not presently pending 
or existing, and, to Sellers\' knowledge, there is not  threatened, (1) any
material strike, slowdown, picketing, work  stoppage or employee grievance
process; (2) any material  charge, grievance proceeding or other claim
against or  affecting such SIGNAL Company relating to the alleged  violation
of any law pertaining to labor relations or  employment matters, including
any charge or complaint filed by  an employee or union with the National
Labor Relations Board,  the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any
comparable  Governmental Authority; (3) any union organizational activity 
or other labor or      17      employment dispute against or
affecting such SIGNAL Company;  or (4) any application for certification of a
collective  bargaining agent.   (iii) No event has occurred or
circumstances exist  that could provide the basis for any work stoppage or
other  labor dispute with respect to such SIGNAL Company.   (iv) Except as
set forth in Section 2.8.1 of  Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule, no employee of
such SIGNAL  Company has any claim against such SIGNAL Company (whether 
under law, any employment agreement or otherwise) on account  of or for: (1)
overtime pay, other than overtime pay for the  current payroll period; (2)
wages or salaries, other than  wages or salaries for the current payroll
period; or (3)  vacation, sick leave, time off or pay in lieu of vacation,

Liabilities of  such SIGNAL Company.   (v) Such SIGNAL Company has made all
required  payments to the relevant unemployment compensation reserve 
accounts with the appropriate governmental departments with  respect to the
employees of such SIGNAL Company and such  accounts have positive
balances.   (b) Section 2.7.2(b) of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule  contains
a list of all employees of each SIGNAL Company as of the date  of this
Agreement and said list correctly reflects their base salaries,  bonuses,
dates of employment and positions.   (c) The employment of each SIGNAL
Company\'s respective  employees is terminable at will without cost to such
SIGNAL Company  except for payments required under the Benefit Plans and the
payment of  accrued salaries or wages and pay for personal leave. No employee
or  former employee has any right to be rehired by a SIGNAL Company prior 
to such SIGNAL Company\'s hiring a Person not previously employed by  such
SIGNAL Company, except as required by law.   2.8 LITIGATION AND CLAIMS  
2.8.1 Except as set forth in Section 2.8.1 of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule,
there is no Proceeding, in law or in equity, including no Proceedings before
any commission or other administrative authority, pending or, to

products sold and services performed by such SIGNAL Company for which
warranties are presently in effect and for which warranty adjustments can be

Date will be higher than the percentage of such products and services which
such SIGNAL Company has sold and performed for which warranty adjustments
have been required in the past. Neither SIGNAL Company has paid or been
required to pay direct, incidental, or consequential damages to any Person in
connection with any of such products or services at any time during the six

notice of the intention of the U.S. Government (through relevant contracting

but not limited to, a breach or violation in any respect of any statute or
regulation pertaining to any Government Contract. Neither SIGNAL Company has
received any show cause notices, cure notices, or negative determinations of
responsibility with respect to any Government Contract. There exists no
outstanding claim against either SIGNAL Company, either by the U.S.
Government or by any prime contractor, subcontractor, vendor or other third
party, arising under or relating to any Government Contract.   2.12.3
Neither SIGNAL Company has asserted any request for equitable adjustment
concerning money, interpretation of Contract terms or other relief under any

and such SIGNAL Company is entitled to all progress payments received with
respect thereto.   2.12.4 Neither SIGNAL Company has received notice of any
failure to comply with the Truth in Negotiations Act (10 U.S.C. Section
2306a, 41 U.S.C. Section 254(d)) or to submit where required cost or pricing
data that were accurate, complete and current. Neither SIGNAL Company has

Government.   2.12.5 Neither SIGNAL Company is subject to any Liability, or
Claim therefor, for or with respect to price adjustment under any Government
Contract, including any liability for defective pricing or undisclosed

may lead to the termination of the prime contract or the subcontract.  
2.12.6 Neither SIGNAL Company has received notice that either such SIGNAL
Company or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, or consultants
is under administrative, civil, or criminal investigation, indictment or writ
of information, audit or internal investigation with respect to any alleged

regarding any Government Contract. Neither the U.S. Government nor any prime

any Government Contract or Government Bid.    24      2.12.7 Neither
SIGNAL Company has been debarred, suspended or disqualified from bidding for

purpose ineligibility to bid on certain Contracts due to generally applicable
bidding requirements) and it has not received notice that any suspension,
debarment or disqualification action has been commenced against such SIGNAL
Company with respect to any Government Contract. There exists no fact or
circumstance that would warrant the institution of suspension, debarment or
disqualification proceedings or the finding of nonresponsibility
or ineligibility on the part of either SIGNAL Company with respect to any
employee, director, officer, agent or consultant of such SIGNAL Company.
There is no valid basis for (i) the suspension, debarment or disqualification
of either SIGNAL Company from bidding on or performing Contracts or
subcontracts with any Governmental Authority, or (ii) any claim pursuant to
any audit by any Governmental Authority in connection with any Government
Contracts or subcontracts relating to the provision of products or services
to or for the benefit of a Governmental Authority.   2.12.8 Each SIGNAL
Company has complied with all the material terms and conditions of each

complied in all material respects with all applicable U.S. Government laws
and regulations in connection with all cost accounting, materials management
and procurement systems maintained by such SIGNAL Company and has never been
subject to the Cost Accounting Standards. No material cost incurred by either
SIGNAL Company pertaining to any Government Contract or Government Bid has
been formally questioned or challenged, is the subject of any investigation
or has been disallowed by the U.S. Government.   2.12.10 Each SIGNAL Company
possesses all necessary facility security clearances, personnel security
clearances and permits for the execution of its obligations under any
Government Contract and Section 2.12.10 of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule sets
forth all facility security clearances held by each SIGNAL Company. Sellers
have no reason to believe that such clearances and permits will not continue
as currently in effect.   2.12.11 Each SIGNAL Company has complied in all
material respects with all applicable statutes and other regulations,
including the False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Act of 1986, the Federal
Election Campaign Act of 1971, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act and the
regulations under each of them. No payment has been made by either SIGNAL
Company, or by any person on behalf of such SIGNAL Company, in connection
with any Government Contract or Government Bid in violation of applicable
procurement laws or regulations.   2.12.12 Neither SIGNAL Company has made
any representations or certifications that are incomplete or untrue in any
respect or filed any accountings that are inaccurate in any respect as to any
Government Contract. Each SIGNAL Company has complied in all material
respects with all such representations and certifications.   2.12.13
Section 2.12.13 of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule identifies (i) by
description or inventory number all material Government-Furnished
Property that is or should be in the       25    possession of
SIGNAL, and (ii) each Government Contract to which each such item of
Government-Furnished Property relates.   2.12.14 Neither SIGNAL Company has
been audited or investigated and is not now being audited or threatened in
writing with an investigation by the Government Accounting Office, the
Department of Defense or any of its agencies other than the Defense Contract
Audit Agency, the DOJ, or the Inspector General of any Governmental
Authority. Neither SIGNAL Company has been the subject or recipient of any
adverse audit finding or report by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.  
2.12.15 During the ten (10) years prior to the date hereof, neither SIGNAL
Company has conducted or initiated any internal investigation, or made
a voluntary disclosure to the U.S. Government, with respect to any
alleged irregularity, misstatement or omission arising under or relating to
any Government Contract or Government Bid, and to Sellers\' knowledge there
exists no irregularity, misstatement or omission arising under or relating to
any Government Contract or Government Bid that has led to any of the
consequences set forth in this section or any other damage, penalty
assessment, recoupment of payment or disallowance of cost. Neither SIGNAL
Company has conducted any investigation in connection with which such SIGNAL
Company has engaged outside legal counsel or independent accountants, or made
any voluntary disclosure to the U.S. Government outside the ordinary course
of business as a result of any suspected irregularity with respect to any
Government Contract.   2.12.16 Neither SIGNAL Company has any interest in
any pending or potential Claim against the U.S. Government or any prime
contractor, subcontractor or vendor arising under or relating to any
Government Contract or Government Bid. Section 2.12.16 of Sellers\'
Disclosure Schedule identifies each audit currently in process by the U.S.
Government or any other Person that is a party to such Government
Contract.   2.13 SECURITIES LAWS MATTERS.   2.13.1 The Notes will be
acquired for investment for each of the Seller\'s own account, not as a
nominee or agent, and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any
part thereof. Such Seller has no present intention of selling, granting any
participation in, or otherwise distributing the same. Such Seller further
represents that such Seller does not have any Contract, undertaking,
agreement or arrangement with any Person to sell, transfer or
grant participations to such Person or to any third Person, with respect to
any of the Notes.   2.13.2 Sellers have received all the information they
consider necessary or appropriate for deciding whether to acquire the Notes.
Each Seller further represents that they have had an opportunity to ask
questions and receive answers from Purchaser regarding the terms and
conditions of the Notes and the business, properties and financial condition
of Purchaser.   2.13.3 Each Seller can bear the economic risk of their
investment, and has such knowledge and experience in financial or business
matters that they are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the
investment in the Notes.     26      2.13.4 Each Seller is an
"accredited investor" within the meaning of Securities and Exchange
Commission Rule 501 of Regulation D, as presently in effect.   2.13.5 Each
Seller understands that the Notes they are acquiring are characterized as
"restricted securities" under the federal securities laws inasmuch as they
are being acquired from Purchaser in a transaction not involving a public
offering and that under such laws and applicable regulations such securities
may be resold without registration under the federal securities laws only in
certain limited circumstances. In this connection, each Seller represents
that they are familiar with Rule 144, as presently in effect, and understands
the resale limitations imposed thereby and by the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act").   2.13.6 Without in any way limiting the
representations set forth above, each Seller further agrees not to make any
disposition of all or any portion of the Notes unless and until:   (a)
There is then in effect a registration statement  under the Securities Act
covering such proposed disposition and such  disposition is made in
accordance with such registration statement; or   (b) Such Seller shall have
notified Purchaser of the  proposed disposition and shall have furnished
Purchaser with a detailed  statement of the circumstances surrounding the
proposed disposition,  and if reasonably requested by Purchaser, such Seller
shall have  furnished Purchaser with an opinion of counsel, reasonably
satisfactory  to Purchaser, that such disposition will not require
registration of  such shares under the Securities Act. It is agreed that
Purchaser will  not require opinions of counsel for transactions made
pursuant to Rule  144 except in unusual circumstances.   2.13.7 It is
understood that the Notes may bear the following legend in addition to any
other legends called for by Delaware law or this Agreement:   "These
securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or any state securities laws. They may not be sold, offered for
sale, pledged or hypothecated in the absence of a registration statement
in effect with respect to the securities under such Act or an opinion of
counsel satisfactory to the Company that such registration is not required or
unless sold pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933."   2.14
PERSONAL PROPERTY AND OTHER MATTERS   2.14.1 Section 2.14.1 of Sellers\'
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all personal property included in
"property and equipment" on the Interim Balance Sheet and all other Equipment
used in their respective operations with a current net book value in excess
of $50,000. All tangible personal property used by each SIGNAL Company that
is material to the conduct of its business as it is currently being conducted
is either owned by the SIGNAL Companies or leased under an agreement
described in Section 2.14.1 of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule. All Equipment
is in satisfactory operating condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear
excepted). The assets of the SIGNAL Companies constitute all assets
(including, without limitation, Intellectual Property) necessary for, or in
fact used in, the conduct of the business of the SIGNAL Companies as
conducted on June 30, 2002. As of the Closing Date, the continuing    
27     operations of SIGNAL LLC shall consist solely of certain assets
and Liabilities related to the Senate Contract as described in Section 2.14.1
of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule.   2.14.2 Neither of the SIGNAL Companies
nor any of their former or current officers, directors, employees, agents or
representatives has, with respect to such SIGNAL Company or its business
activities, violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or otherwise made,
directly or indirectly, any bribes or kickbacks, illegal political
contributions, payments from corporate funds not recorded on the books and
records of such SIGNAL Company, payments from corporate funds to or for the
benefit of governmental officials, in their individual capacities, for the
purpose of affecting their action or the action of the government they
represent, to obtain favorable treatment in securing business or licenses or
to obtain special concessions, or illegal payments from corporate funds to
obtain or retain business. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
neither SIGNAL Company has directly or indirectly made or agreed to make
(whether or not said payment is lawful) any payment to obtain, or
with respect to, sales other than usual and regular compensation to its
employees and sales representatives with respect to such sales.   2.14.3
Neither the SIGNAL Companies nor Sellers have taken any actions which were
calculated to dissuade, or, to Sellers\' knowledge, had the effect of
dissuading, any present employees, representatives or agents of the SIGNAL
Companies from continuing an association with either of the SIGNAL Companies
after the Closing. To Sellers\' knowledge, no officer or other key employee
of the SIGNAL Companies intends to terminate employment with the
SIGNAL Companies prior to, upon, or shortly after the Closing of the
transaction contemplated hereby.   2.14.4 None of the representations or
warranties of Sellers in this Agreement omits any material fact known to
Sellers, the disclosure of which is necessary in order to make any of such
representations or warranties not materially misleading in light of the
circumstances under which it was made, and that could reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the SIGNAL Companies taken as a
whole.   2.14.5 Except as set forth in Section 2.14.5 of Sellers\'
Disclosure Schedule, neither Sellers, nor any of their Affiliates, nor the
SIGNAL Companies have dealt with any Person who is or may be entitled to a
broker\'s commission, finder\'s fee, investment banker\'s fee or similar
payment from either of the SIGNAL Companies or Purchaser for arranging the
transactions contemplated hereby or introducing the parties to each
other.   ARTICLE 3  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER   3.1
GENERAL STATEMENT. Purchaser makes the representations and warranties set
forth in this Article 3. All such representations and warranties have been
made to induce Sellers to enter into this Agreement, shall survive

any investigation or lack of investigation by Sellers. No specific
representation or warranty shall limit the generality or applicability of a
more general representation or warranty. Representations and warranties of
Purchaser are initially made as of the date hereof. All        
28   representations and warranties of Purchaser are made subject to the
exceptions noted in the schedule delivered by Purchaser to Sellers

properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted.
Purchaser is qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing

Adverse Effect.   3.3 AUTHORITY; NON-CONTRAVENTION; APPROVALS.   3.3.1
Purchaser has full corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party and to perform its
obligations and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Purchaser and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by Sellers,
constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of Purchaser enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be
limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws affecting or relating to enforcement of creditors\' rights
generally and (ii) general equitable principles.   3.3.2 The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser does not violate, conflict with or
result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default)
under, or result in the termination of, or accelerate the performance
required by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration under, or
give rise to any obligation to make payments or provide compensation under,

any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets may
be bound         29    or affected. The consummation by Purchaser
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not result in any

requirements applicable to certain facilities of the SIGNAL Companies and
certain of its personnel, no declaration, filing or registration with,

rule, regulation, ordinance or Judgment of any governmental or regulatory

warranties hereunder of the party making such supplement or amendment,

their Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly, as a partner,
stockholder, proprietor, consultant, joint venturer, investor or in any other
capacity:   (a) engage in, or own, manage, operate or control, or 
participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, any 
business or entity anywhere in the United States that provides services  to
the U.S. Government in the areas of information technology services  and
information systems services; provided, however, that nothing  herein shall
prohibit Sellers and their Affiliates from owning,  managing, operating,
investing in or controlling a business that sells  information technology
products (including software it develops), and  provides installation,
configuration and upgrade services in connection  therewith, to the U.S.
Government, or owning, in the aggregate, not  more than five percent (5%) of
any class of securities of a publicly  traded entity in any of the foregoing
lines of business so long as  neither Sellers nor any of its Affiliates
participates in any way in  the management, operation or control of such
entity or holding the  Notes or other securities of Purchaser;   (b) hire
or solicit to perform services (as an employee,  consultant or otherwise) any
Persons who are, or within the six (6)  month period immediately preceding
Sellers\' or such Affiliates action  were, employees of either SIGNAL Company
or take any actions which are  intended to persuade any employee of the
SIGNAL Companies to terminate  his or her association with such SIGNAL
Company;   (c) solicit any customer of either SIGNAL Company to  purchase
products or services which could be supplied by a SIGNAL  Company; and  
(d) from and after the Closing, Sellers and their  Affiliates shall keep

benefit or the benefit of any other Person, any  information regarding either
SIGNAL Company and the material terms of  this Agreement (including the
Purchase Price). The obligation of  Sellers and their Affiliates under this
subsection (d) shall not apply  to information which: (i) is or becomes
generally available to the  public without breach of the commitment provided
for in this subsection  (d); or (ii) is required to be disclosed by
Applicable Law or by a  court or tribunal or Governmental Authority;
provided, however, that in  any such case, Sellers shall notify Purchaser as
early as reasonably  practicable prior to disclosure to allow Purchaser to
take appropriate  measures to preserve the confidentiality of such
information.   7.4.2 Sellers acknowledge that, given the nature of the
business of the SIGNAL Companies, the covenants contained in this Section 7.4
constitute a material portion of the consideration for the Purchase Price,
contain reasonable limitations as to time, geographical area and scope of
activity to be restrained, and do not impose a greater restraint than is
necessary to protect and preserve for the benefit of Purchaser the goodwill
of the SIGNAL Companies and to       41      protect the
legitimate business interests of Purchaser. If, however, any provision of
this Section 7.4 is determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be
unenforceable by reason of its extending for too long a period of time or
over too large a geographic area or by reason of its being too extensive in
any other respect or for any other reason it will be interpreted to extend
only over the longest period of time for which it may be enforceable and/or
over the largest geographical area as to which it may be enforceable and/or
to the maximum extent in all other aspects as to which it may be enforceable,
all as determined by such court and in such action. Sellers agree that
Purchaser\'s remedies at law for any Breach or threat of Breach by Sellers of
the provisions of this Section 7.4 will be inadequate, and that
Purchaser shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, without the
necessity for the posting of a bond or other collateral security, to
eliminate and prevent Breaches of the provisions of this Section 7.4 and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof.   7.5 LETTER OF
CREDIT. Sellers shall take all steps necessary to maintain and keep in place
the Letter of Credit Agreement entered into in conjunction with the judgment
in the Proceedings set forth on Section 7.5 of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule,
until a final non-appealable judgment in such case is rendered and any
amounts payable by SIGNAL in connection therewith are fully satisfied and to
pay all amounts owing as they come due related to such judgment.   7.6
FURTHER ASSURANCES. The parties shall execute such further documents, and
perform such further acts, as may be necessary to transfer and convey the
Shares to Purchaser on the terms herein contained and to otherwise comply
with the terms of this Agreement.   ARTICLE 8  INDEMNIFICATION   8.1

Schedule or in any documents included or referred to therein or may be
otherwise known to Purchaser prior to or at the date of this Agreement or on
the Closing Date), any Proceedings associated with the litigation matters

OBLIGATIONS.   8.4.1 Sellers shall not be liable to the Purchaser
Indemnitees with respect to any Claim for indemnification under Section 8.3
unless (i) the amount of Damages resulting from any separate fact, condition
or event that constitutes a Breach of a representation or warranty relating
to such Claim is in excess of $50,000 ( the "Individual Indemnification
Threshold") and (ii) the aggregate amount of Damages relating to Claims
meeting the Individual Indemnification      43     Threshold (but
excluding any claims for which the thresholds in this Section 8.4.1 do not
apply) is in excess of $1,250,000 (the "Aggregate
Indemnification Threshold"). Once the Aggregate Indemnification Threshold has
been met, Sellers shall then be liable for all Claims in excess of the
Individual Indemnification Threshold excluding such Claims as were aggregated
to reach the Aggregate Indemnification Threshold. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Sellers shall be liable for all Claims arising under Sections
8.3.3, 8.3.4 and 8.3.5 and Breaches of Section 2.4.12 and Section 10.5,
without regard to the Individual Indemnification Threshold or Aggregate
Indemnification Threshold.   8.4.2 The maximum amount for which Sellers
shall be liable to the Purchaser Indemnitees under this Agreement or any
Transaction Document, and for the transactions described herein, is
$20,000,000 (the "Indemnification Limit"); provided, that, neither Seller
shall be liable to the Purchaser Indemnitees, in the aggregate, under this
Agreement, and for the transactions described herein, for more than his or
her Pro Rata Portion of the Indemnification Limit; and provided, further,
that neither Seller shall be liable to any Purchaser Indemnitee with respect
to any individual Claim for indemnification under Section 8.3 for more than
his or her Pro Rata Portion of the amount that is finally determined to be
due and owing to such Purchaser Indemnitee. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnification Limit shall not apply to Claims arising under Sections
8.3.3, 8.3.4 and 8.3.5 and Breaches of Section 2.4.12 and Sections 10.1, 10.2
and 10.5, nor shall such Claims be counted toward the Indemnification
Limit.   8.4.3 Sellers\' representations and warranties, and
Sellers\' obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees under Section
8.3, shall survive the Closing and will remain in effect until: (i) February
15, 2004 with respect to any failure on the part of Sellers or the SIGNAL
Companies to perform any covenants or agreements set forth herein, or any
Breach of any of the representations and warranties made in Article 2, other
than such representations and warranties specifically identified in the
following clause; (ii) sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable
federal or state statute of limitations, whichever is longer, with respect to
any Breach of any of the representations and warranties made in Sections 2.4
or 2.9 or Damages described in Sections 8.3.3; or (iii) four years and 180
days from the Closing Date with respect to the Damages described in Section
8.3.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers\' representations and
warranties made in Sections 2.2.1, 2.2.10, 2.2.11, 2.4.12, Sellers\'
covenants in Sections 10.1, 10.2 and 10.5 and Sellers\' obligation to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnities for any Breach of these representations,
warranties and covenant under Section 8.3, as well as Sellers\' obligation to
indemnify the Purchaser Indemnities under Section 8.3.5 shall survive
indefinitely.   8.5 PURCHASER\'S INDEMNIFICATION COVENANTS. Purchaser
shall indemnify, save and keep Sellers and their successors and assigns
("Sellers Indemnitees") forever harmless against and from all Damages
sustained or incurred by any Sellers Indemnitee as a result of or arising out
of or by virtue of:   8.5.1 any Breach of any representation and warranty
made by Purchaser to Sellers in Article 3 or in any Transaction Document
delivered to Sellers in connection herewith; or   8.5.2 any Breach by
Purchaser of, or failure by Purchaser to comply with, any of the covenants or
obligations under this Agreement or in any Transaction Document to be
performed by Purchaser (including, without limitation, its obligations under
this Article 8).     44      8.6 COOPERATION. Subject to the
provisions of Sections 8.8 and 8.9, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, at its own expense, to participate in the defense of any Third Party
Claim, and if said right is exercised, the parties shall cooperate in the
investigation and defense of said Third Party Claim.   8.7 SUBROGATION. The
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to require that any action be
brought against any other Person before action is brought against it
hereunder by the Indemnified Party and shall not be subrogated to any right
of action until it has paid in full or successfully defended against the
Third Party Claim for which indemnification is sought.   8.8 THIRD PARTY
CLAIMS OTHER THAN TAXES. Promptly following the receipt of written notice of
a Third Party Claim, other than a Third Party Claim with respect to Taxes (as
to which Section 8.9 will apply), the party receiving the notice of the Third
Party Claim shall (a) notify the other party of its existence and (b) if the
party giving such notice is an Indemnified Party, specifying, to the extent
then known, the basis hereunder upon which the Indemnified Party\'s claim for
indemnification is asserted. The Indemnified Party may, upon reasonable
notice, tender the defense of a Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party.
If:   (a) the defense of a Third Party Claim is so tendered and  within
thirty (30) days thereafter such tender is accepted without  qualification by
the Indemnifying Party; or   (b) within thirty (30) days after the date on
which  written notice of a Third Party Claim has been given pursuant to
this  Section 8.8, the Indemnifying Party shall acknowledge in writing to
the  Indemnified Party and without qualification its obligation to provide 
full and complete indemnity as provided in this Article 8 and assume  the
defense of the Third Party Claim;  then, except as hereinafter provided, the
Indemnified Party shall not, and the Indemnifying Party shall, have the right
to contest, defend, litigate or settle such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right to be represented by counsel at the
Indemnified Party\'s expense in any such contest, defense, litigation or
settlement conducted by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall
lose its right to defend and settle the Third Party Claim if it shall fail to
diligently contest and defend the Third Party Claim. So long as the
Indemnifying Party has not lost its right and/or obligation to contest,
defend, litigate and settle as herein provided, the Indemnifying Party shall
have the exclusive right to contest, defend and litigate the Third
Party Claim and shall have the exclusive right, in its discretion exercised
in good faith, and upon the advice of counsel, to settle any such matter,
either before or after the initiation of litigation, at such time and upon
such terms as it deems fair and reasonable; provided, that at least five (5)
days prior to any such settlement, written notice of its intention to settle
shall be given to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnified Party shall have
consented thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. All
expenses (including without limitation attorneys\' fees) incurred by the
Indemnifying Party in connection with the foregoing shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any
settlement negotiated by an Indemnifying Party, no Indemnified Party shall be
required by an Indemnifying Party to (x) enter into any settlement that does
not include as an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or
plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect
of      45     such claim or litigation, (y) enter into any
settlement that attributes by its terms liability or wrongdoing to the
Indemnified Party or (z) consent to the entry of any judgment that does not
include as a term thereof a full dismissal of the litigation or Proceeding
with prejudice. No failure by an Indemnifying Party to acknowledge in writing
its indemnification obligations under this Article 8 shall relieve it of such
obligations to the extent they exist. If the Indemnifying Party fails to
accept a tender of, or assume, the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to
this Section 8.8, or if, in accordance with the foregoing, the Indemnifying
Party shall lose its right to contest, defend, litigate and settle such a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, without
prejudice to its right of indemnification hereunder, in its discretion
exercised in good faith and upon the advice of counsel, to contest, defend
and litigate such Third Party Claim, and may settle such Third Party Claim,
either before or after the initiation of litigation, at such time and upon
such terms as the Indemnified Party deems fair and reasonable;
provided, that, the Indemnified Party will not settle such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. If, pursuant to this Section 8.8, the
Indemnified Party so contests, defends, litigates or settles a Third Party
Claim for which it is entitled to indemnification hereunder as hereinabove
provided, the Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party
for the reasonable attorneys\' fees and other expenses of defending,
contesting, litigating and/or settling the Third Party Claim which are
incurred from time to time, forthwith following the presentation to the
Indemnifying Party of itemized bills for said attorneys\' fees and other
expenses. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Sellers shall, in their sole and absolute discretion, have the
right to contest, defend, litigate and settle the Proceedings set forth in
Section 8.3.3 of Sellers\' Disclosure Schedule.   8.9 CLAIMS INVOLVING
TAXES. The party ultimately responsible for any Tax under this Agreement
shall control audits and disputes or portions thereof related to such Taxes
(including action taken to pay, compromise or settle such Taxes); provided,
however, that (i) Sellers shall control all audits and disputes (including
all action taken to pay, compromise or settle such audits and disputes)
related to Tax periods of the SIGNAL Companies ending on or before the
Closing Date, and (ii) Sellers and Purchaser shall jointly control, in good
faith with each other, audits and disputes relating to a taxable period of
the SIGNAL Companies that includes but does not end on the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) neither Sellers nor the SIGNAL
Companies shall enter into any closing agreement (as defined in Section 7121
of the Code, or any comparable provisions of state, county, local or foreign
law) which is binding on Purchaser or the SIGNAL Companies for any taxable
period ending after the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; (y)
neither Sellers nor the SIGNAL Companies shall agree to any settlement
concerning Taxes for any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date,
which settlement would result in an increase in Taxes of the SIGNAL Companies
or Purchaser for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date, without
the prior written consent of Purchaser, which written consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed and (z) neither Purchaser nor either of the
SIGNAL Companies shall agree to any settlement concerning Taxes that would
result in an increase in Taxes, which Sellers would be required to pay
(taking into account their indemnification obligations hereunder), without
prior written consent of Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Reasonable out of pocket expenses with respect to such
audits and disputes shall be borne by Sellers and Purchaser in proportion to
their responsibility for the Taxes at issue in the audit and dispute as set
forth in this Agreement. Except as otherwise       
46     provided by this Agreement, the non-controlling party shall be
afforded a reasonable opportunity to participate in such proceedings at its
own expense. Any party who receives any notice of a pending or threatened Tax
audit, assessment, or adjustment against or with respect to a SIGNAL Company,
Purchaser or Sellers which may give rise to liability of any other party
hereto to a Tax authority or under this Agreement, shall promptly notify the
other parties hereto within ten (10) business days of the receipt of such
notice.   8.10 CHARACTERIZATION OF INDEMNITY PAYMENTS. Purchaser and
Sellers agree to treat any payment made by Sellers hereunder to Purchaser as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price. However, in the event that it is
finally determined that any such payment constitutes taxable gain or income
to Purchaser or a SIGNAL Company, such payment shall be increased so that the
payee receives, on an after-Tax basis, the amount which would have been
received had the payment not resulted in taxable gain or income, subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 8.4.   8.11 EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Except
for the remedies expressly provided in Sections 4.4.3 and 9.5, and
Proceedings for Breaches of the covenants and agreements set forth in Article
7, the remedies set forth in this Article 8 shall be the sole remedies for
(i) a Breach by any party of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements made by such party in this Agreement and (ii) any other Claim in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby other than fraud
claims.   ARTICLE 9  EFFECT OF TERMINATION   9.1 GENERAL. The parties
shall have the rights and remedies with respect to the termination and/or
enforcement of this Agreement which are set forth in this Article 9.   9.2
RIGHT TO TERMINATE. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing:   9.2.1 by the mutual written consent of
Purchaser and Sellers;   9.2.2 by prompt notice given in accordance with
Section 12.2 by either of the parties if the Closing shall not have occurred
at or before 11:59 p.m. on November 15, 2002;   9.2.3 by Purchaser if any
condition in Section 5.2 (other than Section 5.2.8) has not been satisfied as
of the date specified for Closing and if satisfaction of such a condition by
November 15, 2002 is or becomes impossible (other than through the failure of
Purchaser to comply with its obligations under this Agreement) and Purchaser
has not waived such condition on or before such date; or   9.2.4 by Sellers
if any condition in Section 5.1 has not been satisfied as of the date
specified for Closing and if satisfaction of such a condition by November 15,
2002 is or becomes impossible (other than through the failure of Sellers to
comply with their obligations under this Agreement) and Sellers have not
waived such condition on or before such date.      47       9.3
CERTAIN EFFECTS OF TERMINATION. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement by either Sellers or Purchaser as provided in Section 9.2:   
9.3.1 Purchaser\'s right of access pursuant to Section 4.2.1 shall terminate
and each party, if so requested by the other party, will use commercially
reasonable efforts to return promptly every document furnished to it by the
other party (or any subsidiary, division, associate or Affiliate of such
other party) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether
so obtained before or after the execution of this Agreement, and any copies
thereof (except for copies of documents publicly available) which may have
been made, and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its representatives and any representatives of financial institutions and
investors and others to whom such documents were furnished promptly to return
such documents and any copies thereof any of them may have made; and  
9.3.2 all information received by any party hereto with respect to the
business of the other party hereto or their respective
subsidiaries, divisions, Affiliates or associates (other than information
which is a matter of public knowledge or which has heretofore been or is
hereafter published in any publication for public distribution or filed as
public information with any Governmental Authority) shall not, unless
otherwise required by law, at any time be disclosed to third parties by, such
party for any reason whatsoever.   This Section 9.3, Sections 4.4 and 9.5
and Article 8 and Article 12 shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.   9.4 REMEDIES. Notwithstanding any termination right granted
in Section 9.2, in the event of the non-fulfillment of any condition to a
party\'s closing obligations, such party may elect to do one of the
following:   9.4.1 proceed to close despite the non-fulfillment of any
closing condition, it being understood that consummation of the Closing shall
be deemed a waiver of a Breach of any representation, warranty or covenant or
of any party\'s rights and remedies with respect thereto; or   9.4.2
decline to close, terminate this Agreement as provided in Section 9.2, and
thereafter seek damages to the extent permitted in Section 9.5.   9.5 RIGHT
TO DAMAGES. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.2, neither
party hereto shall have any claim hereunder against the other except if the
circumstances giving rise to such termination were caused either by the other
party\'s Breach of this Agreement, or by any of the representations and
warranties contained in Article 2 by such other party being in a material
respect incorrect when made, in which event termination shall not be deemed
or construed as waiving, limiting or denying any legal or equitable right or
remedy of said party, and said party shall also be entitled to
recover, without limitation, its costs and expenses which are incurred in
pursuing its rights and remedies (including reasonable attorneys\' fees).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Agreement is terminated and Purchaser
has been unable to obtain financing to complete the transaction and the
conditions in Sections 5.2.1, 5.2.3, 5.2.5 and 5.2.7 have been met (or in the
case of Section 5.2.1, can be delivered immediately upon the request of
Purchaser), then Purchaser shall be unconditionally obligated to pay SIGNAL,
on or       48      before the date that is ten days after the
date on which this Agreement is terminated, $4,400,000 in cash, as liquidated
damages and not as a penalty. In the event Purchaser obtains financing for
the transaction prior to Sellers\' satisfaction of the condition set forth in
Section 5.2.5 and such financing subsequently becomes unavailable before the
condition in Section 5.2.5 is satisfied, then Purchaser shall have no
obligation to make the payment referred in this Section 9.5. The foregoing
shall be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for any failure of Purchaser to
close because Purchaser is unable to satisfy the condition set forth in
Section 5.2.8.   ARTICLE 10  TAX MATTERS   10.1 TAX PERIODS ENDING ON OR
BEFORE THE CLOSING DATE. Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared, on
a basis consistent with prior Tax Returns, and timely file or cause to be
timely filed all Tax Returns for the SIGNAL Companies for all Tax periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are required to be filed on or
after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall permit Sellers to review such Tax
Returns not less than thirty (30) days prior to the filing of such Tax
Returns and Purchaser shall make or cause to be made such revisions to such
Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Sellers and shall cause such Tax
Returns to be filed as so revised. For this purpose, any such requested
revision that is not inconsistent with prior practice and that would not
subject any SIGNAL Company or Tax Return preparer to penalties shall be
deemed reasonable. Purchaser shall timely pay or cause each SIGNAL Company
to timely pay all Taxes reflected as being payable by such SIGNAL Company on
any such Tax Return and Sellers shall indemnify the applicable SIGNAL Company
within fifteen (15) days after the later of (i) payment by Purchaser or the
SIGNAL Companies of such Taxes and (ii) Sellers\' receipt of notice that such
Taxes have been paid, to the extent such Taxes are not reflected in the
reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown
in the Financial Statements as adjusted for operations and transactions in
the ordinary course of business since the ending date of such Financial
Statements through the Closing Date in accordance with past practice.  
10.2 TAX PERIODS BEGINNING BEFORE AND ENDING AFTER THE CLOSING DATE.
Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared, on a basis consistent with
prior Tax Returns, and timely file or cause to be timely filed all
Tax Returns of the SIGNAL Companies for Tax periods which begin before the
Closing Date and end after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall permit Sellers
to review such Tax Returns not less than thirty (30) days prior to filing
such Tax Returns and Purchaser shall make or cause to be made such revisions
to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Sellers but only to the
extent that positions taken on such Tax Returns adversely affect Sellers
(taking into account the indemnity rights and obligations hereunder) and
shall cause such Tax Returns to be filed as so revised. Purchaser shall
timely pay or cause each SIGNAL Company to timely pay all Taxes reflected as
being payable by such SIGNAL Company on any such Tax Return and Sellers shall
indemnify the SIGNAL Companies within fifteen (15) days after the later of
(i) the date on which such Taxes are paid and (ii) Sellers\' receipt of
notice that such Taxes have been paid an amount equal to the portion of such
Taxes which relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the
Closing Date to the extent such Taxes are not reflected in the reserve for
Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established
to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown in the
Financial Statements as adjusted for operations and transactions in the
ordinary course of business since      49     the ending date of
such Financial Statements in accordance with past practice. For purposes of
this Section 10.2, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic
basis and are payable for a taxable period that includes (but does not end
on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of
such taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any
Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed
to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of days in the entire taxable period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based
upon or related to income or receipts be deemed equal to the amount which
would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date.
Any credits relating to a taxable period that begins before and ends after
the Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the relevant taxable
period ended on the Closing Date. All determinations necessary to give effect
to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior
practice of the SIGNAL Companies.   10.3 COOPERATION ON TAX MATTERS.  
10.3.1 Purchaser and the SIGNAL Companies, on the one hand, and Sellers, on
the other hand, shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing and amending of
Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise and any audit, litigation
or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party\'s request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Purchaser, the SIGNAL Companies and Sellers agree (i) to
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the SIGNAL Companies relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by Purchaser or Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give the other party
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if the other party so requests, Purchaser, the
SIGNAL Companies or Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other party
to take possession of such books and records.   10.3.2 Purchaser and
Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).   10.3.3 Purchaser and Sellers further
agree, upon request, to provide the other party with all information that
either party may be required to report pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code
and all Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.   10.4 TAX SHARING
AGREEMENTS. All Tax indemnity, Tax sharing or Tax allocation agreements for
any Tax on or related to income under which the SIGNAL Companies would have
liability shall be terminated as of the Closing Date (other than any
agreements set forth on       50   Section 10.4 of Sellers\'
Disclosure Schedule) and, after the Closing Date, Purchaser and the SIGNAL
Companies shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.  
10.5 SECTION 338(h)(10) ELECTION.   10.5.1 At Purchaser\'s option, Sellers
will join with Purchaser in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code (and any corresponding elections under state, local, or foreign tax
law) (collectively a "Section 338(h)(10) Election") with respect to the
purchase and sale of the Shares hereunder. Sellers and Purchaser shall
provide to the other all necessary information to permit the Section
338(h)(10) Election to be made. Sellers and Purchaser shall, as promptly as
practicable, take all actions necessary or appropriate (including filing IRS
Form 8023 and other such forms, returns, elections, schedules, attachments
and other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve a timely
Section 338(h)(10) Election.   10.5.2 Sellers shall include in their
individual Tax Returns all items of income, gain, loss and deduction and any
other tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Election, or any
election under state, local, or foreign law similar to the election available
under Section 338(g) of the Code, to the extent required by Applicable Law.
To the extent that a SIGNAL Company is required to pay any Tax attributable
to the making of the Section 338(h)(10) Election (including any Tax imposed
under Section 1374 of the Code), or any election under state, local, or
foreign law similar to the election available under Section 338(g) of the
Code, Purchaser shall timely pay or cause such SIGNAL Company to timely pay
