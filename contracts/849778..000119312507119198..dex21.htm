ARTICLE 2

THE MERGER

Section 2.01 _The Merger_.

(a) At the Effective Time, Cyclone shall be merged with and into MergerSub in
accordance with Delaware Law, at which time the separate existence of Cyclone
shall cease, and MergerSub shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation"), and shall be a wholly owned, direct subsidiary of Hurricane.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all of the rights, privileges, powers and franchises and be subject to all of
the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of Cyclone and
MergerSub, all as provided under Delaware Law.

Section 2.02 _Effective Time_. At the Closing the parties shall file a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Delaware
Secretary of State in such form as is required by and executed and completed
in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law and make all other
filings or recordings required by Delaware Law to effect the Merger. The
Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or
at such later time as Hurricane and Cyclone mutually agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger).

Section 2.03 _Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place as
soon as practicable, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days, after
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by
their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing), or such other time and
date as the parties may agree to in writing. The Closing shall be held at the
offices of Brown Rudnick Berlack Israels LLP in Boston, Massachusetts, unless
another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. 

Section 2.04 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

(a) subject to this Article 2, each share of Cyclone Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
cancelled in accordance with Section 2.04(b) and Dissenting Shares referred to
in Section 2.11), shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
(i) 0.52 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of Hurricane Stock (the "Stock Merger
Consideration") and (ii) $16.50 in cash without interest  



 

8  (the "Cash Merger Consideration" and, together with the Stock Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Hurricane Stock as
specified below, the "Merger Consideration");

(b) each share of Cyclone Stock that is (i) held by Cyclone as treasury stock
or (ii) owned by Hurricane or any Hurricane Subsidiary, in each case
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereof in accordance with
this Article 2; and

(c) each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of MergerSub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued,
outstanding and unchanged as a validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.05 _Surrender and Payment_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Hurricane shall designate its transfer agent,
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, or another bank or trust company
reasonably satisfactory to Cyclone to act as the exchange agent hereunder
(the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger
Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Cyclone Stock (the
"Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Cyclone Stock
(the "Uncertificated Shares"). At the Effective Time, Hurricane shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent, to be held in trust for the holders of Cyclone Stock,
stock certificates (if such shares shall be certificated) representing shares
of Hurricane Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.04 in exchange for
outstanding shares of Cyclone Stock and an amount of cash sufficient to
deliver to the holders of Cyclone Stock (other than the Dissenting Shares) the
aggregate Merger Consideration. From time to time after the Effective Time,
Hurricane shall make available to the Exchange Agent, as needed, cash in
amounts that are sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant
to Section 2.07 and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
2.05(f), in each case, to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the
Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event
within ten (10) Business Days after the Effective Time, Hurricane shall send,
or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Cyclone
Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which
shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

(b) Each holder of shares of Cyclone Stock shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the aggregate Merger Consideration that such holder
has a right to receive pursuant to Section 2.04. The shares of Hurricane Stock
constituting part of such Merger Consideration, at Hurricanes option, shall
be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is
requested by a holder of shares of Cyclone Stock or is otherwise required
under Applicable Law. As a result of the Merger, at the Effective Time, all
shares of Cyclone Stock shall cease to be outstanding and each holder thereof
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof and any dividends
or other distributions payable in respect thereof in accordance with Section
2.05(f).

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be
properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.



 

9 (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Cyclone shall be closed
and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
transfer books of Cyclone or the Surviving Corporation of the shares of
Cyclone Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to such time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.05(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Cyclone Stock six months after the Effective Time shall be returned
to Hurricane, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of
Cyclone Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section
2.05 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Hurricane for payment
of the Merger Consideration, and any dividends and distributions with respect
thereto, in respect of such shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Hurricane shall not be liable to any holder of
shares of Cyclone Stock for any amounts properly paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Cyclone Stock six years
after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to such time
when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, the property of Hurricane, free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to securities of
Hurricane constituting part of the Merger Consideration, and no cash payment
in lieu of fractional shares as provided in Section 2.07, shall be paid to the
holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares
not transferred until such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section
2.05. Following such surrender or transfer, Hurricane shall pay or shall
cause the Exchange Agent to pay, without interest, to the Person in whose name
the securities of Hurricane have been registered, (i) at the time of such
surrender or transfer, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares to which such Person is entitled pursuant to Section 2.07 and the
amount of all dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time previously paid or payable on the date of such surrender with
respect to such securities, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time and prior to surrender or transfer and with a payment date
subsequent to surrender or transfer payable with respect to such securities.

Section 2.06 _Stock Options; Restricted Stock Units; Performance
Shares; ESPP_.

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of Cyclone (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering
the Cyclone Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to effect the following:

(i) each option to purchase shares of Cyclone Stock under any employee stock
option or compensation plan or arrangement of Cyclone (a "Cyclone Stock
Option") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended
and converted into an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions
(giving effect to any applicable acceleration of vesting thereunder) as were
applicable under such Cyclone Stock Option, the number of shares of Hurricane
Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the sum of (x) the
product of (A) the number of shares of Cyclone Stock subject to such Cyclone
Stock Option and (B) the Exchange Ratio and (y) the product of (A) the number
of shares of Cyclone Stock subject to such Cyclone Stock Option and (B) the
Cash Portion Exchange Multiple, at an exercise price per share of Hurricane
Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (1) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of Cyclone Stock
subject to such Cyclone Stock Option by (2) the aggregate number of shares of
Hurricane Stock to be subject to such Cyclone Stock Option after giving effect
to the adjustments in this clause (i) (each, as so adjusted, an "Adjusted
Option");



 

10 (ii) each Cyclone Restricted Stock Unit outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be amended and converted into the right to receive, on
the same terms and conditions (giving effect to any applicable acceleration of
vesting thereunder) as were applicable under such Cyclone Restricted Stock
Unit, the number of shares of Hurricane Stock (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) equal to the sum of (x) the product of (A) the number of shares
of Cyclone Stock subject to such Cyclone Restricted Stock Unit and (B) the
Exchange Ratio and (y) the product of (A) the number of shares of Cyclone
Stock subject to such Cyclone Restricted Stock Unit and (B) the Cash Portion
Exchange Multiple (each, as so adjusted, an "Adjusted Restricted Stock Unit");

(iii) each Cyclone Performance Share outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall vest at the target award level in accordance with the
terms and conditions applicable under such Cyclone Performance Share and
holders thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration on the
same basis as all other shares of Cyclone Stock;

(iv) each share of Cyclone Stock deferred (a "Cyclone Share Unit") under the
Amended and Restated Director Compensation Method Plan (the "Director
Compensation Plan") shall be converted into, on the same terms and conditions
(giving effect to any applicable acceleration of vesting thereunder) as are
applicable under the Director Compensation Plan, a number of shares of
Hurricane Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the sum of
(x) the product of (A) the number of shares of Cyclone Stock subject to such
Cyclone Share Unit and (B) the Exchange Ratio and (y) the product of (A) the
number of shares of Cyclone Stock subject to such Cyclone Share Unit and (B)
the Cash Portion Exchange Multiple (each, as so adjusted, an "Adjusted Share
Unit");

(v) holders of each share of Cyclone Stock accrued in 2007 for issuance to
members of the Board of Directors of Cyclone on January 1, 2008 shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration on the same basis as all other
shares of Cyclone Stock; and

(vi) prior to the Effective Time, Cyclone shall make any amendments to the
terms of such stock option or compensation plans or arrangements that are
necessary to give effect to the adjustments contemplated by this Section
2.06.

(b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of Cyclone (or, if appropriate, any committee of the Board of
Directors of Cyclone administering the Cyclone ESPP), shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions as may be required to provide that with
respect to the Cyclone ESPP (i) each participants outstanding right to
purchase shares of Cyclone Stock under the Cyclone ESPP shall terminate on the
day immediately prior to the day on which the Effective Time occurs, provided
that all amounts allocated to each participants account under the Cyclone
ESPP as of such date shall thereupon be used to purchase from Cyclone whole
shares of Cyclone Stock at the applicable price determined under the terms of
the Cyclone ESPP for the then outstanding offering periods using such date as
the final purchase date for each such offering period, and (ii) the Cyclone
ESPP shall terminate immediately following such purchases of Cyclone Stock.

(c) The adjustments provided in Section 2.06(a) with respect to any Cyclone
Stock Option to which Section 421(a) of the Code applies shall be and are
intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section
424(a) of the Code. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time,
Hurricane shall deliver to the holders of Adjusted Options, Adjusted
Restricted Stock Units and Adjusted Share Units appropriate notices setting
forth such holders rights pursuant to the respective Cyclone Stock Plans and
the Contracts evidencing the grants of such Adjusted Options, Adjusted
Restricted Stock Units or Adjusted Share Units, as the case may be, which
shall provide, among other things, that such Adjusted Options, Adjusted
Restricted Stock Units, Adjusted Share Units and Contracts have been assumed
by Hurricane and shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions
(subject to the adjustments required by this Section 2.06 after giving effect
to the Merger).

(d) Except as otherwise contemplated by this Section 2.06 and except to the
extent required under the respective terms of the Adjusted Options, Adjusted
Restricted Stock Units or Adjusted Share Units, as the case  



 

11  may be, all restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting with respect
to such Adjusted Options, Adjusted Restricted Stock Units or Adjusted
Share Units, to the extent that such restrictions or limitations shall not
have already lapsed, and all other terms thereof, shall remain in full force
and effect with respect to such Adjusted Options, Adjusted Restricted Stock
Units or Adjusted Share Units after giving effect to the Merger and the
assumption by Hurricane as set forth above.

(e) Hurricane shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of
Cyclone Stock Options, Cyclone Restricted Stock Units and Cyclone Share Units
pursuant to this Section 2.06, including the reservation, issuance and listing
of Hurricane Stock as is necessary to effectuate the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.06. Subject to receiving full cooperation from
Cyclone and its independent registered public accounting firm, within one (1)
Business Day of the Closing Date, Hurricane shall file with the SEC
a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a post-effective
amendment to a registration statement previously filed under the 1933 Act,
with respect to the shares of Hurricane Stock subject to Adjusted Options,
Adjusted Restricted Stock Units and Adjusted Share Units and, where
applicable, shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to have such
registration statement declared effective as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time. With respect to those individuals, if any, who, subsequent to
the Effective Time, will be subject to the reporting requirements under
Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act, where applicable, Hurricane shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to administer Cyclone Stock Options and
Cyclone Restricted Stock Units assumed pursuant to this Section 2.06 in a
manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "Cash Portion Exchange Multiple" means the
quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Cash Merger Consideration by (y) the
average of the per share closing sale prices of Hurricane Stock on The NASDAQ
Stock Market (the "Nasdaq") for the ten consecutive trading days ending on
(and including) the date that is three (3) trading days prior to the Closing
Date.

Section 2.07 _Fractional Shares_. No certificates, scrip or shares of
Hurricane Stock representing fractional shares of Hurricane Stock or book-
entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a
stockholder of Hurricane by virtue of such fractional share interests. All
fractional shares of Hurricane Stock that a holder of shares of Cyclone Stock
would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be
aggregated and if a fractional share results from such aggregation, such
holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash
without interest determined by multiplying the closing sale price of a share
of Hurricane Stock on the Nasdaq on the Closing Date by the fraction of a
share of Hurricane Stock to which such holder would otherwise have been
entitled. Hurricane shall deposit with the Exchange Agent the funds required
to make the cash payments required by this Section 2.07 when and as needed. 

Section 2.08 _Withholding Rights_. Hurricane, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such
amounts as Hurricane, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If
Hurricane, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent so withholds
amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which Hurricane, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent made such deduction and withholding.

Section 2.09 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Hurricane, delivery by such Person of an agreement in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Hurricane or, as Hurricane may reasonably deem
necessary, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as
Hurricane may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Cyclone Stock represented
by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.



 

12 Section 2.10 _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Hurricane or Cyclone shall occur by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, the Exchange Ratio and any amounts payable pursuant to
Section 2.05(f) or Section 2.07 of this Agreement shall be appropriately
adjusted.

Section 2.11 _Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Cyclone Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a holder thereof
who has not voted in favor of or consented to the adoption of this Agreement
and has properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights for such shares
in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law (the "Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but
shall become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined
to be due to such holder pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262
of Delaware Law to be paid by the Surviving Corporation; provided, however,
that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal and payment under Delaware Law, the
right of such holder to such appraisal of its shares of Cyclone Stock shall
cease and such shares of Cyclone Stock shall be deemed converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration to which
any such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(a), any cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.07 and any
dividends or other distributions to which any such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.05(f), in each case without interest. Cyclone shall give
Hurricane (a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal received by
Cyclone, withdrawals of such demands, and any other related instruments
served pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law and received by Cyclone and (b)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisals under Delaware Law. Cyclone shall not, except
with prior written consent of Hurricane, (i) voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal for Dissenting Shares, (ii) offer to
settle, or settle, any such demands, (iii) waive any failure to timely deliver
a written demand for appraisal in accordance with Delaware Law, or (iv) agree
to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.12  _Affiliates_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, to the fullest extent permitted by law, no Stock Merger
Consideration shall be delivered to a Person who is an "affiliate" of Cyclone
in accordance with Section 8.13 until such Person has executed and delivered
an Affiliate Agreement to Hurricane.

Section 2.13 _Reservation of Right to Revise Transaction Structure_. Not
later than the effective time of the Joint Proxy Statement, to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law, and subject to compliance by the directors
of Cyclone and Hurricane with their respective fiduciary duties, the parties
may amend this Agreement to change the method of effecting the business
combination among Hurricane, MergerSub, and Cyclone, and each party shall
reasonably cooperate and enter into good faith negotiations with respect to
such efforts, including to provide for (a) a merger of MergerSub with and into
Cyclone, (b) a merger of Cyclone directly into Hurricane, (c) a series of
steps pursuant to which Hurricane and Cyclone become wholly-owned
subsidiaries of a newly-formed corporation that is in turn owned by the
former stockholders of Hurricane and Cyclone or (d) some other substantially
similar structure; provided, however, that no such change shall (i) alter or
change the amount or kind of consideration to be issued to holders of Cyclone
Stock, as provided for in this Agreement, (ii) result in the transaction no
longer qualifying for non-recognition treatment for federal income tax
purposes, either as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code or as a transaction qualifying for such treatment under Section 351
of the Code, (iii) materially delay receipt of any approval required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) require

other party), (v) impair or delay the consummation of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated hereby or the ability of any party hereto to perform
its obligations hereunder by more than fifteen (15) calendar days, or (vi)
cause a party to breach any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth herein (unless the other party shall waive compliance
with such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in a manner

moratorium or other similar Applicable Laws relating to creditors rights and
remedies generally and to general principles of equity.

individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Cyclone or
would not materially impair the ability of Cyclone to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.04 _Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
Cyclone of this Agreement and the consummation by Cyclone of the transactions
contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with, or

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, partnership agreement or
any similar contract (including any contract relating to any transaction,
arrangement or relationship between or among Cyclone or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity
or person, on the other hand) where the purpose or intended effect of such
arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving
Cyclone or any of its Subsidiaries in Cyclones consolidated financial
statements.

Section 4.11 _Contracts_. Except as disclosed in the Cyclone SEC Documents as
of the date hereof, neither Cyclone nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to,
and none of their respective properties or other assets is subject to, any
Contract that is of a nature required to be filed as an exhibit to a report or
filing under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act. None of Cyclone, any of its
Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of Cyclone, any other party thereto is in
violation of or in default under (nor does there exist any condition which
upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would cause such a
violation of or default by Cyclone or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the
Knowledge of Cyclone, any other party thereto under) any Contract to which it
is a party or by which it or any of its properties or other assets is bound,
except for violations or defaults that individually or in the aggregate have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Neither Cyclone nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
otherwise bound by any Contract or covenant restricting Cyclones or any of
its Subsidiaries ability to compete or by any Contract or covenant
restricting in any material respect the research, development, distribution,

Cyclone or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 4.12 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

(a) Except with respect to regulatory compliance, Taxes, Environmental Laws,
and ERISA, which are the subjects of Sections 4.13, 4.16, 4.17 and 4.19,
respectively, each of Cyclone and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all
Applicable Laws applicable to it, its properties or other assets or its
business or operations, except for failures to be in compliance
that individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each of Cyclone and its Subsidiaries has in effect all approvals,
authorizations, certificates, filings, franchises, licenses, notices and

21  and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "FDCA"), necessary for it to
own, lease or operate its properties and other assets and to carry on its
business and operations as currently conducted, except where the failure to
have such Permits individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1,
2004, there has occurred no default under, or violation of, any such Permit,
except for any such default or violation that individually or in the aggregate
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. The consummation of the Merger, in and of itself, would not cause the
revocation or cancellation of any such Permit that individually or in the
aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.13 _Regulatory Compliance_.

(a) As to each product subject to the FDCA or similar Applicable Laws in any
foreign jurisdiction that are developed, manufactured, tested, distributed
and/or marketed by Cyclone or any of its Subsidiaries (a "Medical Device"),
each such Medical Device is being developed, manufactured, tested, distributed
and/or marketed in compliance with all applicable requirements under the FDCA
and similar Applicable Laws, including those relating to investigational use,
premarket clearance or marketing approval to market a Medical Device, good

Association Code of Ethics on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals and
the American Medical Associations guidelines on gifts to physicians, except
for failures in compliance that individually or in the aggregate have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Cyclone. Neither Cyclone nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice
or other communication from the Federal Food and Drug Administration (the
"FDA") or any other Governmental Authority (A) contesting the premarket
clearance or approval of, the uses of or the labeling and promotion of any
products of Cyclone or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) otherwise alleging any
violation applicable to any Medical Device of any Applicable Law, in the case
of (A) and (B), that individually or in the aggregate have had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Cyclone.

(b) No Medical Device is under consideration by Cyclone or any of its
Subsidiaries for recall, withdrawal, suspension, seizure or discontinuance, or
has been recalled, withdrawn, suspended, seized or discontinued (other than
for commercial or other business reasons) by, Cyclone or any of its
Subsidiaries in the United States or outside the United States (whether
voluntarily or otherwise), in each case since January 1, 2003. No proceedings
in the United States or, to the Knowledge of Cyclone, outside of the United
States seeking the recall, withdrawal, suspension, seizure or discontinuance
of any Medical Device are pending, or, to the Knowledge of Cyclone,

a premarket approval application, premarket notification, investigational
device exemption or similar state or foreign regulatory application has been
approved, Cyclone and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with 21 U.S.C. §§ 360
and 360e or 21 C.F.R. Parts 812 or 814, respectively, and all similar
Applicable Laws and all terms and conditions of such licenses or applications,
except for any such failure or failures to be in compliance which individually
or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect on Cyclone. In addition, Cyclone and its
Subsidiaries are in material compliance with all applicable registration and
listing requirements set forth in 21 U.S.C. § 360 and 21 C.F.R. Part 807 and
all similar Applicable Law, except for failures to be in compliance which
individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Cyclone.

(d) No article of any Medical Device manufactured and/or distributed by
Cyclone or any of its Subsidiaries is (A) adulterated within the meaning
of 21 U.S.C. § 351 (or similar Applicable Law), (B) misbranded within the
meaning of 21 U.S.C. § 352 (or similar Applicable Law) or (C) a product that
is in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 360 or § 360e (or similar Applicable Law),
except for failures to be in compliance with the foregoing that individually
or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect.

otherwise, of any pending or, to the Knowledge of Cyclone, threatened
investigation by the FDA pursuant to its "Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material
Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities" Final Policy set forth in 56 Fed. Reg.

material fact or fraudulent statement to the FDA or any other Governmental
Authority, failed to disclose a material fact required to be disclosed to the
FDA or any other Governmental Authority, or committed an act, made a

FDA or any other Governmental Authority to invoke its policy respecting
"Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities"
set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991) or any similar policy.

(f) Neither Cyclone nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge
of Cyclone, any officer, employee or agent of Cyclone or any of its
Subsidiaries, has been convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct for
which debarment is mandated by 21 U.S.C. § 335a(a) or any similar Applicable
Law or authorized by 21 U.S.C. § 335a(b) or any similar Applicable Law.
Neither Cyclone nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of Cyclone,
any officer, employee or agent of Cyclone or any of its Subsidiaries, has been
convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct for which such person or
entity could be excluded from participating in the federal health care
programs under Section 1128 of the Social Security Act of 1935, as amended
(the "Social Security Act") or any similar Applicable Law.

(g) Since January 1, 2003, neither Cyclone nor any of its Subsidiaries has

that individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(h) To the Knowledge of Cyclone, there are no facts, circumstances or
conditions that would reasonably be expected to form the basis for any
investigation, suit, claim, action or proceeding against or affecting Cyclone
or any of its Subsidiaries relating to or arising under (a) the FDCA or (b)
the Social Security Act or regulations of the Office of the Inspector General
of the Department of Health and Human Services, in each case individually or
in the aggregate that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

(i) Cyclone and its Subsidiaries are and at all times in the past three years
have been in compliance with: (i) the FDCA; (ii) the provisions of the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 relating to the privacy
and security of individually identifiable health information, and all

claims, and patient privacy laws and regulations, except for failures to be in
compliance which individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Cyclone. Neither
Cyclone, nor any Subsidiary has received any written notice or other
communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any actual or possible
violation of, or failure to comply with, any legal requirement set forth in
this Section 4.13(i), except for violations of, or failures to be in
compliance, which individually or in the aggregate have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Cyclone.

(j) Neither Cyclone, nor any Subsidiary, nor any officer, director, or, to the
Knowledge of Cyclone, any employee, of Cyclone or a Subsidiary, has been
excluded from participation in any Federal health care program (including
Medicare or Medicaid) or committed any offense in 42 U.S.C. §1320a-7 that
would be the basis for such exclusion.



 

23 Section 4.14 _Litigation; Investigations_. Except as disclosed in the Cyclone
SEC Documents prior to the date of this Agreement, there are no claims,
actions, suits, formal or informal investigations, inquiries or proceedings
(or any reasonable basis therefor) pending against, or, to the Knowledge of
Cyclone, threatened against or affecting, Cyclone, any of its Subsidiaries,
any present or former Cyclone Designated Officer or director of Cyclone or any
of its Subsidiaries or any Person for whom Cyclone or any Subsidiary may be
liable or any of their respective properties before any court or arbitrator
or before or by, before or with any Governmental Authority that, if determined
or resolved adversely to Cyclone, would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Cyclone or
that, as of the date of this Agreement, in any manner challenges or seeks to
prevent, enjoin, alter or delay the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby. There has not been nor are there currently any
internal investigations or inquiries being conducted by Cyclone, the Board of
Directors (or any committee thereof) of Cyclone or any third party at the
request of any of the foregoing concerning any financial, accounting, tax,
conflict of interest, self-dealing, fraudulent or deceptive conduct or other
misfeasance or malfeasance issues.

Section 4.15 _Title to Properties_. Each of Cyclone and its Subsidiaries has
valid title to, or valid leasehold or sublease interests or other comparable
contract rights in or relating to all of its real properties and other
tangible assets necessary for the conduct of its business as currently
conducted, except as have been disposed of in the ordinary course of business
and except for defects in title, easements, restrictive covenants and similar
encumbrances that individually or in the aggregate have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Each of Cyclone
and its Subsidiaries has complied with the terms of all leases or subleases to
which it is a party and under which it is in occupancy, and all leases to
which Cyclone is a party and under which it is in occupancy are in full force
and effect, except for such failure to comply or be in full force and effect
that individually or in the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither Cyclone nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any event or occurrence that
has resulted or could result (with or without the giving of notice, the lapse
of time or both) in a default with respect to any lease or sublease to which
it is a party, which defaults individually or in the aggregate have had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.16 _Taxes_.

(a) Each of Cyclone and its Subsidiaries has filed or has caused to be filed
in a timely manner (within any applicable extension period) all Tax Returns
required to be filed, and all such Tax Returns are complete and accurate in
all respects, except for any failure to file, error or omission that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Each of Cyclone and its Subsidiaries has paid or
caused to be paid (or Cyclone has paid on its behalf) all Taxes due and owing,
and the most recent financial statements contained in the Cyclone SEC
Documents filed as of the date hereof reflect an adequate reserve (determined
in accordance with GAAP) (excluding any reserves for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) for
all Taxes payable by Cyclone and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and
portions thereof accrued through the date of such financial statements.

(b) No Tax Return of Cyclone or any of its Subsidiaries is, or with respect to

by Cyclone or any of its Subsidiaries that any audit, examination or similar
proceeding is pending, proposed or asserted with regard to any Taxes or Tax
Returns of Cyclone or any of its Subsidiaries. The relevant statute of
limitations is closed with respect to the income Tax Returns of Cyclone and
each of its Subsidiaries for all years through 2001. There is no deficiency,
refund litigation, proposed adjustment or matter in controversy with respect
to any material amount of Taxes due and owing by Cyclone or any of its
Subsidiaries. Each deficiency resulting from any completed audit or
examination relating to Taxes by any Taxing Authority has been timely paid or
is being contested in good faith and has been reserved for on the books of
Cyclone. There is no currently effective agreement or other document
extending, or having the effect of extending, the period of assessment or
collection of any Taxes of Cyclone or any of its Subsidiaries, nor has any
request been made for any such extension, and no currently effective power of
attorney (other than powers of attorney authorizing  



 

24  employees of Cyclone or any of its Subsidiaries to act on behalf of Cyclone
or any of its Subsidiaries) with respect to any Taxes has been executed or

in a taxable period ending after the Effective Time taxable income
attributable to income that accrued (for purposes of the financial statements
of Cyclone included in Cyclones SEC Documents filed as of the date hereof) in
a prior taxable period (or portion of a taxable period) but was
not recognized for Tax purposes in any prior taxable period as a result of
(A) an open transaction disposition made on or before the Effective Time, (B)
a prepaid amount received on or prior to the Effective Time, (C) the
installment method of accounting, (D) the completed contract method of
accounting, (E) the long-term contract method of accounting, (F) the cash

Applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including
withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 3121 and 3402 of the
Code and similar provisions under any Federal, state, local or foreign Tax
laws) and have, within the time and the manner prescribed by law, withheld
from and paid over to the proper Governmental Authorities all amounts required
to be so withheld and paid over under Applicable Laws, except where the
failure to comply, withhold or pay would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Cyclone.

(e) During the five-year period ending on the date hereof, neither Cyclone
nor any of its Subsidiaries was a distributing corporation or a controlled
corporation in a transaction intended to be governed by Section 355 of the
Code.

Cyclone or any of its Subsidiaries is, or may be, subject to a material
amount of Tax by that jurisdiction.

(i) Neither Cyclone nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any
Tax Sharing Agreement, Tax indemnity obligation or similar agreement,
arrangement or practice with respect to Taxes (including any advance pricing
agreement, closing agreement or other agreement relating to Taxes with any
Taxing Authority).

(j) No "ownership change" (as described in Section 382(g) of the Code) has
occurred, or is expected to occur prior to the Effective Time, that would
have the effect of limiting the use of "pre-change losses" (as described in
Section 382(d) of the Code) of Cyclone and its Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time.

(k) No Taxing Authority has asserted in writing any Liens for Taxes with
respect to any assets or properties of Cyclone or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for statutory liens for Taxes not yet due and payable.

(l) Neither Cyclone nor any of its Subsidiaries (other than any
Subsidiary that is a member of Cyclones consolidated group for United States
federal income Tax purposes) has been a United States real property holding
corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the
applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.



 

25 (m) "Tax" or "Taxes" means (a) any tax or other like assessment or charge of
any kind whatsoever (including withholding on amounts paid to or by any
Person), together with any interest, penalty, addition to tax or additional
amount imposed by any Governmental Authority (a "Taxing
Authority") responsible for the imposition of any such tax (domestic or
foreign), and any liability for any of the foregoing as transferee, (b)
liability for the payment of any amount of the type described in clause (a) as
a result of being or having been before the Effective Time a member of an

is determined or taken into account with reference to the activities of any
other Person, and (c) liability for the payment of any amount as a result of

indemnification agreement or arrangement). "Tax Return" means any report,
return, document, declaration or other information or filing required to be
supplied to any Taxing Authority with respect to Taxes, including information
returns, any documents with respect to or accompanying payments of estimated
Taxes, or with respect to or accompanying requests for the extension of time
in which to file any such report, return, document, declaration or other
information. "Tax Sharing Agreements" means all existing agreements or
arrangements (whether or not written) binding a party or any of its
Subsidiaries that provide for the allocation, apportionment, sharing or
assignment of any Tax liability or benefit, or the transfer or assignment of
income, revenues, receipts, or gains for the purpose of determining any
Persons Tax liability (excluding any indemnification agreement or
arrangement pertaining to the sale or lease of assets or subsidiaries).

Section 4.17 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise provided herein, "Cyclone
Employee Plans" shall mean all Employee Benefit Plans maintained currently or
at any time within the past six years, or contributed to by Cyclone, any of
Cyclones Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates or to which
Cyclone, any of Cyclones Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates is obligated to contribute, or under which any of them has or may
have any material liability for premiums or benefits . _Section 4.17_ of the
Cyclone Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list of those
Cyclone Employee Plans currently in effect.

(b) With respect to each Cyclone Employee Plan, Cyclone has made available to
Hurricane complete and accurate copies of (i) such Cyclone Employee Plan (or a
written summary of any unwritten plan) together with all amendments, (ii) in
the case of any plan for which Forms 5500 are required to be filed, the
annual reports (Form 5500) for the three most recent years with schedules
attached, (iii) in the case of any plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code, the most recent determination letter from
the Internal Revenue Service, (iv) each trust agreement, group annuity
contract, administration and similar material agreements, investment
management or investment advisory agreements, (v) the most recent summary plan
descriptions and employee handbook, or other similar material employee
communications relating to employee benefits matters, and (vi) the most recent
financial statements for each Cyclone Employee Plan that is funded.

(c) Each Cyclone Employee Plan has been administered in all material respects
in accordance with ERISA, the Code and all other Applicable Laws and
in accordance with its terms, and each of Cyclone, Cyclones Subsidiaries and
their respective ERISA Affiliates have in all material respects met their
obligations with respect to each Cyclone Employee Plan and in all material
respects have timely made (or timely will make) all required contributions
thereto. All filings and reports as to each Cyclone Employee Plan required to
have been submitted to the Internal Revenue Service or to the United States
Department of Labor have been timely submitted. With respect to the Cyclone
Employee Plans, no event has occurred, and, to Cyclones Knowledge, there
exists no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which Cyclone,
Hurricane or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any plan participant
could be subject to any material liability (including penalties or taxes)
under ERISA, the Code or any other Applicable Law, nor will the negotiation or
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement give rise to
any such material liability.



 

26 (d) With respect to the Cyclone Employee Plans, there are no material benefit
obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued
and there are no material benefit obligations which have not been accounted
for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with the
requirements of GAAP, on the financial statements of Cyclone. The assets of
each Cyclone Employee Plan which is funded are reported at their fair market
value on the books and records of such Employee Benefit Plan.

(e) No Cyclone Employee Plan (other than Cyclone Stock Plans) has assets that
include securities issued by Cyclone, any of Cyclones Subsidiaries or any of
their ERISA Affiliates.

(f) All Cyclone Employee Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code (each, a "Qualified Plan") have received determination,
opinion or advisory letters from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect
that such Cyclone Employee Plans are qualified and the plans and trusts
related thereto are exempt from federal income taxes under Sections 401(a)
and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, or Cyclone has remaining a period of
time under applicable U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations or Internal
Revenue Service pronouncements in which to apply for such a letter and to
make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination as to the
qualified status of each such Qualified Plan. To the Knowledge of Cyclone, no
such determination, opinion or advisory letter has been revoked and
revocation has not been threatened, and no such Cyclone Employee Plan has been
amended or operated since the date of its most recent determination letter or
application therefor in any respect, and no act or omission has occurred, that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any material respect its
qualification or materially increase its cost. There has been no termination,
partial termination or discontinuance of contributions to any Qualified Plan
that will result in material liability to Cyclone. Each Cyclone Employee Plan
which is required to satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of the
Code has been tested for compliance with, and satisfies in all material
respects the requirements of Section 401(k)(3) and Section 401(m)(2) of the
Code, as the case may be, for each plan year ending prior to the Closing Date
for which testing is required to be completed.

(g) Neither Cyclone, any of Cyclones Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has (i) ever maintained a Cyclone Employee Plan which was
ever subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA or (ii) ever been
obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No Cyclone Employee Plan is funded by, associated with
or related to a "voluntary employees beneficiary association" within the
meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

(h) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Cyclone Employee Plan
(other than Cyclone Stock Plans or an employment, severance, change in control
or similar agreement with an individual) is amendable and terminable
unilaterally by Cyclone and any of Cyclones Subsidiaries party thereto or
covered thereby at any time without material liability to Cyclone or any of
its Subsidiaries as a result thereof, other than for benefits accrued as of
the date of such amendment or termination and routine administrative costs.

(i) Other than as required under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA, none of the
Cyclone Employee Plans promises or provides health or other welfare benefits
(excluding normal claims for benefits under Cyclones group life insurance,
accidental death and dismemberment insurance and disability plans
and policies) or coverage to any person following retirement or other
termination of employment. _Section 4.17(i)_ of the Cyclone Disclosure
Schedule lists each Cyclone Employee Plan which provides benefits after
termination of employment (other than medical benefits required to be
continued under Section 4980B of the Code and part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I
of ERISA and normal claims for benefits under Cyclones group life insurance,
accidental death and dismemberment insurance and disability plans and

Intellectual Property" means U.S. and foreign (i) patents and pending patent
applications; (ii) trademark registrations (including Internet
domain registrations) and pending trademark applications; and (iii) copyright

has a valid right to use all of the material Intellectual Property (as
defined below) that is used in the business of Cyclone and its Subsidiaries as
currently conducted.

its Subsidiaries business infringes or will infringe upon, violate or
constitute the unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property of any third
party or challenging the ownership, validity, enforceability
or registerability of any material Intellectual Property owned by Cyclone or
any of its Subsidiaries. Neither Cyclone nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to any settlements, covenants not to sue, consents, decrees,

29  violation suits, arbitrations or other adversarial proceedings have been
brought before any court, government agency or arbitral tribunal against any
third party by Cyclone or any of its Subsidiaries which remain unresolved.

(f) Neither Cyclone nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any
material license, sublicense, agreement or instrument to which Cyclone or any
of its Subsidiaries is party or otherwise bound under which Cyclone or its
Subsidiaries derive rights to Intellectual Property that is material to
Cyclones or its Subsidiaries business as currently conducted, nor will the
consummation by Cyclone of the transactions contemplated hereby result in any
loss or impairment of ownership by Cyclone or any of its Subsidiaries of, or
the right of any of them to use, any Intellectual Property that is material
to the business of Cyclone and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, nor,
to the Knowledge of Cyclone, require the consent of any Governmental Authority
or third party with respect to any such Intellectual Property. Neither
Cyclone nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement under which a
third party would be entitled to receive or expand a license or any other
right to any material Intellectual Property of Hurricane or any
of Hurricanes affiliates as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, "Intellectual Property" shall mean
trademarks, service marks, trade names, and internet domain names, together

taken or agreed to take any action, or is aware of any fact or circumstance,
that would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the

person (other than Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated and J.P. Morgan

by Cyclone) is entitled to any brokerage, finders, financial advisors or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of
Cyclone or any of its Subsidiaries. Cyclone has delivered to Hurricane
complete and accurate copies of all agreements under which any such fees or
expenses are payable and all indemnification and other agreements related to

"control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or  



 

30  other antitakeover laws applicable to Cyclone impose restrictions enacted

(i) render the Cyclone Rights Agreement inapplicable to this Agreement, the

solely by reason of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii)
provide that the Expiration Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement) shall
occur immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Neither Hurricane nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, partnership agreement or

any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,
on the other hand) where the purpose or intended effect of such arrangement is

party to, and none of their respective properties or other assets is subject

in violation of or in default under (nor does there exist any condition which
upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would cause such a
violation of or default by Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Each of Hurricane and its Subsidiaries has in effect all Permits necessary
for it to own, lease or operate its properties and other assets and to carry
on its business and operations as currently conducted, except where the

such Permit, except for any such default or violation that individually or in
the aggregate has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. The consummation of the Merger, in and of itself,
would not cause the revocation or cancellation of any such Permit that
individually or in the aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.13 _Regulatory Compliance._

(a) As to each Medical Device developed, manufactured, tested, distributed
and/or marketed by Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries, each such

in the aggregate have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Hurricane.

(b) No Medical Device is under consideration by Hurricane or any of its
Subsidiaries for recall, withdrawal, suspension, seizure or discontinuance, or

in the United States or, to the Knowledge of Hurricane, outside of the United
States seeking the recall, withdrawal, suspension, seizure or discontinuance

not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Hurricane.

(d) No article of any Medical Device manufactured and/or distributed
by Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries is (A) adulterated within the meaning
of 21 U.S.C. § 351 (or similar Applicable Law), (B) misbranded within the
meaning of 21 U.S.C. § 352 (or similar Applicable Law) or (C) a product that
is in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 360 or § 360e (or similar Applicable Law),
except for failures to be in compliance with the foregoing that individually
or in the aggregate have not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991) or any similar policy.

Hurricane, any officer, employee or agent of Hurricane or any of its
Subsidiaries, has been convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct for
which debarment is mandated by 21 U.S.C. § 335a(a) or any similar Applicable
Law or authorized by 21 U.S.C. § 335a(b) or any similar Applicable Law.
Neither Hurricane nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of
Hurricane, any officer, employee or agent of Hurricane or any of its

benefit obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly
accrued and there are no material benefit obligations which have not been
accounted for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with
the requirements of GAAP, on the financial statements of Hurricane. The assets
of each Hurricane Employee Plan which is funded are reported at their fair
market value on the books and records of such Employee Benefit Plan. 

(e) No Hurricane Employee Plan (other than Hurricane Stock Plans) has assets
that include securities issued by Hurricane, any of Hurricanes Subsidiaries
or any of their ERISA Affiliates.

(f) All Hurricane Employee Plans that are intended to be a Qualified
Plan have received determination, opinion or advisory letters from the
Internal Revenue Service to the effect that such Hurricane Employee Plans are
qualified and the plans and trusts related thereto are exempt from federal
income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, or
Hurricane has remaining a period of time under applicable U.S. Department of
the Treasury regulations or Internal Revenue Service pronouncements in which
to apply for such a letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination as to the qualified status of each such Qualified
Plan. To the Knowledge of Hurricane, no such determination, opinion or
advisory letter has been revoked and revocation has not been threatened, and
no such Hurricane Employee Plan has been amended or operated since the date of
its most recent determination letter or application therefor in any respect,
and no act or omission has occurred, that would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect in any material respect its qualification or materially
increase its cost. There has been no termination, partial termination or
discontinuance of contributions to any Qualified Plan that will result in
material liability to Hurricane. Each Hurricane Employee Plan which is
required to satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of the Code has
been tested for compliance with, and satisfies in all material respects the
requirements of Section 401(k)(3) and Section 401(m)(2) of the Code, as the
case may be, for each plan year ending prior to the Closing Date for which
testing is required to be completed.

(g) Neither Hurricane, any of Hurricanes Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has (i) ever maintained a Hurricane Employee Plan
which was ever subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA or
(ii) ever been obligated to contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined
in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA). No Hurricane Employee Plan is funded by,
associated with or related to a "voluntary employees beneficiary
association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

(h) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, each Hurricane Employee Plan
(other than Hurricane Stock Plans or an employment, severance, change in
control or similar agreement with an individual) is amendable and terminable
unilaterally by Hurricane and any of Hurricanes Subsidiaries party thereto
or covered thereby at any time without material liability to Hurricane or any
of its Subsidiaries as a result thereof, other than for benefits accrued as of
the date of such amendment or termination and routine administrative costs.

(i) Other than as required under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA, none of the
Hurricane Employee Plans promises or provides health or other welfare
benefits (excluding normal claims for benefits under Hurricanes  



 

43  group life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and
disability plans and policies) or coverage to any person following retirement
or other termination of employment. _Section 5.17(i)_ of the Hurricane
Disclosure Schedule lists each Hurricane Employee Plan which provides benefits
after termination of employment (other than medical benefits required to be
continued under Section 4980B of the Code and part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I
of ERISA and normal claims for benefits under Hurricanes group life
insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and disability plans
and policies) and the present value of benefits accrued under each such
Hurricane Employee Plan are fully funded, fully covered by insurance or
reflected on the Hurricane Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP.

(j) There is no action, suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration, audit or
investigation pending or, to Hurricanes Knowledge, threatened, with
respect to any Hurricane Employee Plan, other than claims for benefits in the
ordinary course. No Hurricane Employee Plan is or within the last three
calendar years has been the subject of, or has received notice that it is the
subject of, examination by a government agency or a participant in a
government sponsored amnesty, voluntary compliance or similar program.

(k) Each Hurricane Employee Plan maintained or covering employees outside the
United States, and the books and records thereof, is in material compliance
with all Applicable Laws of each applicable jurisdiction. _Section 5.17(k)_
of the Hurricane Disclosure Schedule lists each country in which Hurricane or
any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates has operations and the approximate
number of employees in each such country.

(l) _Section 5.17(l)_ of Hurricane Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of (i) all employment agreements with employees of
Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) all employees or former employees
of Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries who have executed a non-competition
agreement with Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) all severance
agreements, programs and policies of Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries
with or relating to its employees, excluding programs and policies required to
be maintained by Applicable Law; and (iv) all plans, programs, agreements and
other arrangements of Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which
payments (or acceleration of benefits or vesting of options or lapse of
repurchase rights) may be required, or may become payable directly or
indirectly as a result of or in connection with, the negotiation or
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, or the execution of, this
Agreement. True, complete and correct copies of each of the foregoing
agreements to which any employee of Hurricane is a party have been made
available to Cyclone.

(m) There are no pending, reasonably anticipated, or, to the Knowledge of
Hurricane, threatened claims by or on behalf of any Hurricane Employee Plan,
by any employee or beneficiary covered under any such Hurricane Employee
Plan, or otherwise involving any such Hurricane Employee Plan (other than
claims for benefits in the ordinary course).

(n) _Section 5.17(n)_ of the Hurricane Disclosure Schedule lists each
Hurricane Employee Plan or other Contract that, individually or collectively,
could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible
pursuant to Sections 280G (determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of
the Code) or 162(m) of the Code.

Section 5.18 _Labor Relations_. From the date of the most recent financial
statements included in the Hurricane SEC Documents filed with the SEC through
the date hereof, there has not been any adoption, material amendment or
termination by Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries of any collective
bargaining or other labor union Contract to which Hurricane or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound. There are no collective bargaining or other labor union Contracts to
which Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Hurricane or
any of its Subsidiaries is bound. As of the date of this Agreement, none of
the employees of Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries are represented by any
union with respect to their employment by Hurricane or such Subsidiary. Since
January 1, 2004, neither Hurricane nor any of its Subsidiaries has
experienced any material labor disputes, union organization attempts or work
stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts due to labor disagreements.



 

44 Section 5.19 _Environmental Matters_.

Except for those matters that individually or in the aggregate have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect: 

(a) Each of Hurricane and its Subsidiaries is, and has been, in compliance
with all applicable Environmental Laws which compliance includes, but is not
limited to, the possession of all Environmental Permits required under
applicable Environmental Laws and compliance with the terms and conditions
thereof.

(b) There have been no Releases or threatened Releases of Hazardous Materials
in, on, under or affecting any properties currently or formerly owned, leased
or operated by Hurricane, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its former
Subsidiaries.

to the Knowledge of Hurricane, threatened against or affecting Hurricane or
any of its Subsidiaries relating to or arising under Environmental Laws, and
neither Hurricane nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of any
such investigation, suit, claim, action or proceeding.

(d) Neither Hurricane nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into or assumed
by Contract or operation of law or otherwise, any obligation, liability,
order, settlement, judgment, injunction or decree relating to or arising under
Environmental Laws.

(e) To the Knowledge of Hurricane, there are no facts, circumstances or
conditions that would reasonably be expected to form the basis for
any investigation, suit, claim, action, proceeding, compliance obligation or
liability against or affecting Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries relating
to or arising under Environmental Laws.

Section 5.20 _Intellectual Property_

(a) _Section 5.20(a)_ of the Hurricane Disclosure Schedule sets forth as of
the date hereof a true, complete and correct list of all Hurricane Registered
Intellectual Property. All of the Hurricane Registered Intellectual
Property is owned solely by Hurricane or one of its Subsidiaries. "Hurricane
Registered Intellectual Property" means all Registered Intellectual Property
owned by Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) Hurricane or one or more of its Subsidiaries owns, is validly licensed or
has a valid right to use all of the material Intellectual Property that
is used in the business of Hurricane and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted.

(c) The Registered Intellectual Property that is used in and material to the
business of Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, is,
to the Knowledge of Hurricane, subsisting (except with respect to
applications), and has not expired or been cancelled, or abandoned.

(d) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Hurricane, threatened, and at
no time within the three years prior to the date of this Agreement has there
been pending any, material suit, arbitration or other adversarial proceeding
before any court, government agency or arbitral tribunal or in any
jurisdiction alleging that any activities or conduct of Hurricanes or any of
its Subsidiaries business infringes or will infringe upon, violate or
constitute the unauthorized use of the material Intellectual Property of any
third party or challenging the ownership, validity, enforceability or
registerability of any Intellectual Property owned by Hurricane or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither Hurricane nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
settlements, covenants not to sue, consents, decrees, stipulations, judgments,
or orders resulting from suits, actions or similar legal proceedings which
(i) restrict Hurricanes or any of its Subsidiaries rights to use any
Intellectual Property owned by and material to the business of Hurricane or
any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, (ii) restrict the conduct of
the business of Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted in
order to accommodate any third partys Intellectual Property rights, or (iii)
permit third parties to use any Intellectual Property owned by and used in
the business of Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.



 

45 (e) To the Knowledge of Hurricane, no third party is misappropriating,
infringing, diluting or violating any Intellectual Property owned by
Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries that is material to the business of
Hurricane and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, and no Intellectual
Property misappropriation, infringement dilution or violation suits,
arbitrations or other adversarial proceedings have been brought before any
court, government agency or arbitral tribunal against any third party by
Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries which remain unresolved.

(f) Neither Hurricane nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any
material license, sublicense, agreement or instrument to which Hurricane or
any of its Subsidiaries is party or otherwise bound under which Hurricane or
its Subsidiaries derive rights to Intellectual Property that is material to
Hurricanes or its Subsidiaries business as currently conducted, nor will
the consummation by Hurricane of the transactions contemplated hereby result
in any loss or impairment of ownership by Hurricane or any of its Subsidiaries
of, or the right of any of them to use, any Intellectual Property that is
material to the business of Hurricane and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted, nor, to the Knowledge of Hurricane, require the consent of any
Governmental Authority or third party with respect to any such Intellectual
Property. Neither Hurricane nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any

license or any other right to any material Intellectual Property of Cyclone or
any of Cyclones affiliates as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

the proprietary nature of the Intellectual Property owned by Hurricane or such

necessary to exempt the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions

ARTICLE 8 

COVENANTS OF HURRICANE AND CYCLONE

The parties hereto agree that:

Section 8.01 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Cyclone and
Hurricane shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things  



 

51  necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the
taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be
satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) preparing and filing as promptly as
practicable with any Governmental Authority or other Third Party all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents and (iii) obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents,
waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, permits, authorizations, clearances
and other confirmations required to be obtained from any Governmental
Authority or other Third Party that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided that the parties hereto understand and agree that in
no event shall any party be required by this Section 8.01 or any other
provision of this Agreement (i) to enter into any settlement, undertaking,
consent decree, stipulation or agreement with any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) to divest or
otherwise hold separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise), or
take any other action (or otherwise agree to do any of the foregoing) with
respect to any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates
businesses, assets or properties in any such case in (i) or (ii) that would
reasonably be expected to (x) materially and adversely diminish the benefits
expected to be derived by the parties on the date of this Agreement from the
combination of Hurricane and Cyclone via the Merger (such combined business to
be taken as a whole), in such a manner that such party would not have entered
into this Agreement in the face of such materially and adversely diminished
benefits or (y) otherwise have a Material Adverse Effect after the Effective
Time on Hurricane and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation),
taken as a whole, ignoring for this purpose only clause (vi) of the definition
of Material Adverse Effect insofar as it relates to the matters under
consideration with respect to the applicable provision of this Agreement (as
described in this clause (y), a "Regulatory Material Adverse Effect").

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Hurricane
and Cyclone shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
("HSR Filing") pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Each party shall cooperate with the other
party to the extent necessary to assist the other party in the preparation of
its HSR Filing, to request early termination of the waiting period required
by the HSR Act and, if requested, to promptly amend or furnish additional
information thereunder. No party shall voluntarily extend any waiting period
under the HSR Act and/or enter into any agreement with a Governmental
Authority to delay or not to consummate the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement except with the prior written
consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned and which reasonableness shall be determined in light
of each partys obligation to do all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement). If any
objections are asserted with respect to the Merger or this Agreement under any
applicable antitrust or competition law, or if any suit or proceeding is
instituted by any Governmental Authority or any other person challenging the
Merger or this Agreement as violative of any applicable antitrust or
competition law, the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve such objections, suit or proceeding.

Section 8.02 _Certain Filings_.

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Hurricane and
Cyclone shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement,
and Hurricane shall prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement
(in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included). Each of Hurricane and
Cyclone shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective under the 1933 Act as promptly as practicable
after the filing thereof and to keep the Registration Statement effective as
long as is necessary to consummate the Merger.

(b) Each of Cyclone and Hurricane shall provide the other parties and their
respective counsel with (i) any comments or other communications, whether
written or oral, that such party or its counsel may receive from time  



 

52  to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement
or the Registration Statement, as applicable, promptly after receipt of
those comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the response to those comments.

(c) No amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement will be made by Hurricane or Cyclone without the
approval of the other parties hereto, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Each party will advise the other parties, promptly after
it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has
become effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance
of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of Hurricane Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy
Statement or the Registration Statement. If, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, Hurricane or Cyclone discovers any information relating to
any party, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy Statement
or the Registration Statement, so that none of those documents would include
any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements in any such document, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers that information shall promptly notify the other party and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing that information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law or regulation,
disseminated to the stockholders of Hurricane and Cyclone.

(d) Hurricane and Cyclone shall cooperate with one another in (i) determining
whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are
required to be obtained from any Governmental Authority, in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
seeking any of those actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any of
those filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and
seeking promptly to obtain any of those actions, consents, approvals or
waivers and (iii) setting a mutually acceptable date for the Hurricane
Stockholder Meeting and Cyclone Stockholder Meeting, so as to enable them to
occur, to the extent practicable, on the same date. Each party shall permit
the other party to review any communication given by it to, and consult with
each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, any Governmental
Authority and to the extent permitted by the applicable Governmental
Authority, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in
those meetings and conferences, in each case in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 8.03 _Public Announcements_.

(a) Cyclone and Hurricane shall consult with each other before issuing any
press release, making any other public statement or scheduling any press
conference or conference call with investors or analysts with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, except as
may be required by Applicable Law, order of a court of competent jurisdiction
or any listing agreement with or rule of any regulatory body, national
securities exchange or association, shall not issue any such press release,
make any such other public statement or schedule any such press conference or
conference call before that consultation. The initial press release of the
parties shall be a joint press release of Hurricane and Cyclone in the form
that is mutually agreed.

(b) Before any Merger Communication of Hurricane, Cyclone or any of their
respective "participants" (as defined in Rule 165 of the 1933 Act or Item 4
of Schedule 14A of the 1934 Act) is (i) disseminated to any investor, analyst,
member of the media, employee, client, customer or other third-party or
otherwise made accessible on the website of Hurricane, Cyclone or any
such participant, as applicable (whether in written, video or oral form via
webcast, hyperlink or otherwise), or (ii) utilized by any executive officer,
key employee or advisor of Hurricane, Cyclone or any such participant, as
applicable, as a script in discussions or meetings with any such third
parties, Hurricane or Cyclone, as the case may be, shall (or shall cause any
such participant to) cooperate in good faith with respect to any such Merger
Communication for purposes of, among other things, determining whether that
communication (x) is required to be filed under Rules 165 and 425 of the 1933
Act or  



 

53  (y) constitutes "soliciting material" that is required to be filed by Rule
14a-6(b) or Rule 14a-12(b) of the 1934 Act, as applicable. Hurricane,
MergerSub or Cyclone, as applicable, shall (or shall cause any such
participant to) give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by the other such party or parties and their counsel on any such Merger
Communication. For purposes of the foregoing, the term "Merger Communication"
shall mean, with respect to any Person, any document or other written
communication prepared by or on behalf of that Person, or any document or
other material or information posted or made accessible on the website of
that Person (whether in written, video or oral form via webcast, hyperlink or
otherwise), that is related to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, if reviewed by a relevant stockholder, could reasonably be
deemed to constitute either (x) an offer to sell such stock or a solicitation
of an offer to buy Hurricane Stock or (y) a "solicitation" of "proxies" (in
each case, as defined in Rule 14a-1 of the 1934 Act) in favor of the Merger.

Section 8.04 _Stockholder Meetings_.

(a) Cyclone shall use all commercially reasonable efforts in accordance with
and subject to Delaware Law, its certificate of incorporation and bylaws
and the rules of Nasdaq to cause a meeting of its stockholders (the "Cyclone
Stockholder Meeting") to be duly called and held as soon as reasonably
practicable for the purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger. Subject to Section 8.07, the Joint Proxy Statement
shall contain the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Cyclone that
Cyclones stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger (the
"Cyclone Recommendation"). In connection with the Cyclone Stockholder
Meeting, Cyclone shall (i) mail the Joint Proxy Statement and all other proxy
materials for such meeting to its stockholders as promptly as practicable
after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the 1933 Act,
(ii) use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Cyclone Stockholder
Approval and (iii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to
such meeting. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this
Agreement is otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms hereof, this
Agreement and the Merger shall be submitted to Cyclones stockholders at the
Cyclone Stockholder Meeting whether or not (x) Cyclones Board of Directors
shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change or (y) any Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly proposed or announced or otherwise submitted
to Cyclone or any of its advisors.

 

(b) Hurricane shall use all commercially reasonable efforts in accordance with
and subject to Delaware Law, its certificate of incorporation and bylaws and
the rules of Nasdaq to cause a meeting of its stockholders (the "Hurricane
Stockholder Meeting") to be duly called and held as soon as reasonably
practicable for the purpose of securing the Hurricane Stockholder
Approval. Subject to Section 8.07, the Joint Proxy Statement shall contain
the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Hurricane that Hurricanes
stockholders approve the Hurricane Share Issuance and the Hurricane Charter
Amendment (the "Hurricane Recommendation"). In connection with the Hurricane
Stockholder Meeting, Hurricane shall (i) mail the Joint Proxy Statement and
all other proxy materials for such meeting to its stockholders as promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
1933 Act, (ii) use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Hurricane
Stockholder Approval and (iii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements
applicable to such meeting. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
unless this Agreement is otherwise terminated in accordance with the terms
hereof, the Hurricane Share Issuance and the Hurricane Charter Amendment shall
be submitted to Hurricanes stockholders at the Hurricane Stockholder Meeting
whether or not (x) Hurricanes Board of Directors shall have effected an
Adverse Recommendation Change or (y) any Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly proposed or announced or otherwise submitted to Hurricane or any of
its advisors.

Section 8.05 _Director and Officer Liability_. Hurricane shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

(a) Hurricane shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume the obligations
with respect to all rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities, including advancement of expenses, for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of
the current or former directors or officers of Cyclone (or its Subsidiaries)
(each an "Indemnified Person") as provided under Cyclones certificate of  



 

54  incorporation, bylaws or any indemnification Contract between such directors
or officers and Cyclone (in each case, as in effect on the date hereof),
without further action, as of the Effective Time and such obligations shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Hurricane shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, provide officers and directors liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time covering each such Indemnified Person currently covered by Cyclones
officers and directors liability insurance policy on terms with respect to
coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on
the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Hurricane or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, may (i) substitute therefor policies of
Hurricane or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, containing
terms with respect to coverage (including as coverage relates to deductibles
and exclusions) and amounts no less favorable to such directors and officers
or (ii) request that Cyclone obtain such extended reporting period coverage
under its existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective
Time); _provided, further_ , that, in satisfying its obligation under this
Section 8.05(b), neither Hurricane nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to pay an aggregate annual premium in excess of the amounts
described on _Section 8.05(b)_ of the Hurricane Disclosure Schedule. It is
understood and agreed that in the event such coverage cannot be obtained for
such amount or less in the aggregate, Hurricane or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, shall only be obligated to provide such coverage as may be
obtained for such aggregate amount. In lieu of the foregoing, Cyclone may
obtain prepaid policies prior to the Effective Time, which policies may
provide the Indemnified Persons with coverage of equivalent amount and on no
more favorable terms than are provided by Cyclones current policy in effect
on the date hereof for an aggregate period of at least six years with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. If such prepaid policies have been
obtained prior to the Effective Time, Hurricane and the Surviving Corporation
shall be relieved of all further obligations under this Section 8.05(b);
_provided_ , that Hurricane and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such
policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor their obligations
thereunder.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and to the maximum
extent permitted by Applicable Law, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation is made or brought against any Indemnified Person on or prior to
the date that is the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions
of this Section 8.05 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(d) If Hurricane, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Hurricane or such Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.05.

(e) The provisions of this Section 8.05 (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have by Contract or otherwise.

Section 8.06 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Hurricane shall use its all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Hurricane Stock to be
issued in connection with the Merger to be listed on Nasdaq, subject to
official notice of issuance.

Section 8.07 _No Solicitation; Other Offers_.

(a) _General Prohibitions_. Subject to the remainder of this Section 8.07,
neither Cyclone nor Hurricane (either, a "No-Shop Party") shall, and no such
No-Shop Party shall authorize or permit any of its respective  



 

55  Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or
advisors to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action
to knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage the submission of any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in
any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to
that No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of that No-Shop Party or any of
its Subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly
assist, participate in, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any effort
by any Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal, (iii) make an Adverse Recommendation Change, (iv) grant any waiver
or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class
of equity securities of that No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries, (v)
enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet or other
similar instrument relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement of the sort and in the circumstances described in
Section 8.07(b)) or (vi) propose publicly or agree to do any of the
foregoing related to any Acquisition Proposal.

(b) _Exception to Permit Discussions and/or Due Diligence_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Board of Directors of a No-Shop Party, directly or
indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, may, prior to
Hurricane Stockholder Approval (in the case of Hurricane) or Cyclone
Stockholder Approval (in the case of Cyclone), (i) engage in negotiations or
discussions with any Third Party that, subject to such No-Shop Partys
compliance with Section 8.07(a), has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that such No-Shop Partys Board of Directors has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal (a "Takeover Response") and
(ii) after making such determination furnish to such Third Party non-public
information relating to that No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to that No-Shop
Party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement dated April 5,
2007 between Cyclone and Hurricane (the "Confidentiality Agreement") (a copy
of which shall be provided for informational purposes only to the other
party), but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii)
only if the Board of Directors of that No-Shop Party determines in good faith
by a majority vote, after considering advice from outside legal counsel
to that No-Shop Party, that failing to take that action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

(c) _Required Notices_. The Board of Directors of a No-Shop Party shall not
take any of the actions referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding
subsection unless that No-Shop Party shall have delivered to the other Party a
prior written notice advising such other party that it intends to take such
action. In addition, a No-Shop Party shall notify the other Party promptly
(but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by that No-Shop Party, or
any of its advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal, any indication that a Third
Party is considering making an Acquisition Proposal or of any request for
information relating to such No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries or for
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of such No-Shop
Party or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that may be considering
making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. Such No-Shop Party shall provide
such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the Third Party making,
and the terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or
request. A No-Shop Party shall keep the other Party reasonably informed, on a
current basis, of the status and details of any such Acquisition Proposal,
indication or request.

(d) _Ability to Change Recommendation_.

(A) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, a No-Shop
Party and its Board of Directors shall be permitted, other than in response
to an Acquisition Proposal, to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change if (i)
such No-Shop Party shall not have received the Cyclone Stockholder Approval
(in the case of Cyclone) or the Hurricane Stockholder Approval (in the case
of Hurricane) and (ii) in response to a material development or change in
circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof that was not known to
the Board of Directors of the No-Shop Party as of or prior to the date hereof
(which change or development does not relate to an Acquisition Proposal and
which change or development is not, and does not result from, a change in the
market price of the common stock of the other party  



 

56  primarily as a result of the announcement of the transactions contemplated
hereby) (such material development or change in circumstances,
an "Intervening Event"), the Board of Directors of such No-Shop Party has
determined in good faith (after consultation with, and taking into account the
advice of, its outside legal counsel) that, in light of such Intervening
Event, the failure of the Board of Directors of such No-Shop Party to effect
such an Adverse Recommendation Change would result in a breach of its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; _provided_ that, the Board of Directors
of a No-Shop Party shall nevertheless not make such an Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to this sentence unless (x) such No-Shop Party promptly
notifies the other party, in writing, at least three (3) Business Days before
taking that action (unless the Intervening Event arises fewer than six (6)
Business Days prior to the Hurricane Stockholders Meeting or Cyclone
Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be) advising the other party that the
Board of Directors of the No-Shop Party intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail and (y) during such three
(3) Business Day period, if requested by the other party, engaged in good
faith negotiations with such party to amend this Agreement in such a manner
that obviates the need for a Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of the
Intervening Event.

(B) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject
to the following sentence), in response to an Acquisition Proposal from a
Third Party, a No-Shop Party and its Board of Directors shall be permitted to
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and, subject to compliance with the
provisions of Section 11.04, immediately terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 10.01 if (i) such No-Shop Party shall not have
received the Cyclone Stockholder Approval (in the case of Cyclone) or the
Hurricane Stockholder Approval (in the case of Hurricane), (ii) it has
received an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a Third
Party, (iii) its Board of Directors has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors of a
nationally recognized reputation and taking into account any adjustments to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by the other party
in response to the notice contemplated by the next sentence) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (iv) its Board of
Directors, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, determines in
good faith that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. However, the Board of Directors of
a No-Shop Party shall nevertheless not make such an Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement in accordance with the foregoing, unless,
(x) such No-Shop Party promptly notifies the other party, in writing at least
three (3) Business Days before taking that action, of its intention to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change (such notice, a "Notice of Superior Proposal")
and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of any
Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the Board of
Directors of the No-Shop Party and the identity of the person making the
proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms or any material amendment to any other material term of any such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new
three (3) Business Day period), (y) during such three (3) Business Day period,
if requested by the other party, engaged in good faith negotiations with such
party to amend this Agreement in such a manner than any Acquisition Proposal
which was determined to constitute a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior
Proposal; and (z) at the end of such three (3) Business Day period, determined
that such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn and continues
to constitute a Superior Proposal (taking into account any changes to the
financial terms of this Agreement proposed by the other party following a
Notice of Superior Proposal, as a result of the negotiations between the No-
Shop Party and the other party pursuant to clause (y) or otherwise).

(C) Any Adverse Recommendation Change shall not change the approval of this
Agreement, or any other approval of the Board of Directors of Cyclone or
Hurricane, as the case may be, including in any respect that would have the
effect of causing any state (including Delaware) corporate takeover statute or
other similar statute to be applicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, including the Merger.

(e) _Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions_. Each No-Shop Party shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the advisors, employees and other agents
of such No-Shop Party to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third
Party conducted  



 

57  prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such Third Party (or
its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential information about that
No-Shop Party that was furnished by or on behalf of that No-Shop Party to
return or destroy all such information.

(f) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means any bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal (which definition shall be read, for this purpose, without the word
"inquiry" in clause (i) and (ii) thereof) for at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Cyclone Stock or Hurricane Stock (as the case may be)
or a sale or purchase of all or substantially all the assets of Cyclone or
Hurricane (as the case may be) on terms that the Board of Directors of a No-
Shop Party determines in good faith by a majority vote, after consultation
with its legal advisor and financial advisors of nationally recognized
reputation and taking into account such matters deemed relevant in good faith
by such Board of Directors, including among other things, all the terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up fees, expense
reimbursement provisions, conditions to consummation and long-term strategic
considerations, are more favorable from a financial point of view to the
stockholders of such No-Shop Party than the Merger and for which (x)
financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then fully
committed or reasonably determined to be available and (y) such proposed
transaction is reasonably capable of being completed on the terms set forth
in the Acquisition Proposal, each as determined by the Board of Directors of
that No-Shop Party.

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 8.07 shall prohibit a No-Shop Party
from (x) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act or making a statement required under Rule
14a-9 under the 1934 Act or (y) making any disclosure of factual matters to
the stockholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of such No-Shop Party (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) it is required to disclose in order to not breach its fiduciary
duties to such No-Shop Partys stockholders under Applicable Law; provided,
however that (i) compliance with such rules shall in no way limit or modify
the effect that any such action pursuant to such rules has under this
Agreement and (ii) in no event shall such No-Shop Party or its Board of
Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any
action prohibited by Section 8.07(a), (b), (c) or (d).

 

Section 8.08 _Accountant s Letters_.

(a) Hurricane shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be
delivered to Cyclone two letters from Hurricanes independent public
accountants, one dated approximately the date on which the
Registration Statement shall become effective and one dated a date within two
Business Days of the Closing Date, each addressed to Hurricane and Cyclone, in
form reasonably satisfactory to Cyclone and customary in scope for comfort
letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the Registration Statement.

(b) Cyclone shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be
delivered to Hurricane two letters from Cyclones independent public
accountants, one dated approximately the date on which the Registration
Statement shall become effective and one dated a date within two Business
Days of the Closing Date, each addressed to Cyclone and Hurricane, in form
reasonably satisfactory to Hurricane and customary in scope for comfort
letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection
with registration statements similar to the Registration Statement.

Section 8.09 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Cyclone or MergerSub, any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of Cyclone or MergerSub, any other actions and things to
vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets of Cyclone acquired or to be acquired by such Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

Section 8.10 _Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the
Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality
Agreement, Cyclone and Hurricane shall (i) give to the other party, its
counsel,  



 

58  financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable
access (including for the purpose of coordinating integration
planning activities and transition planning with the employees of Cyclone and

such Persons may reasonably request and (iii) instruct its employees, counsel,

Section shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by any party hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
parties shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information to
another party where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client or other legal privilege of the disclosing party or contravene any
Applicable Law or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement (provided that the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide such information or access in a manner that does not cause such
prohibition or violation).

Section 8.11 _Notices of Certain Events_. Each party shall promptly notify the
others of:

(a) any material notice or other material communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which consent would be
material to Hurricane and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole after giving
effect to the Merger;

(b) any material notice or other material communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to

Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to any of
such partys representations or warranties, as the case may be, or that
relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(d) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term hereof that would reasonably be expected
to cause any condition set forth in Article 9 not to be satisfied; and

agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder that would
reasonably be expected to cause any condition set forth in Article 9 not to

not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving that notice.

efforts to provide representation letters substantially in the form of
_Exhibits E and F_ hereto (together with such amendments or additions to the
representations as counsel may reasonably request), each dated on or about
the date the Registration Statement shall become effective, and subsequently,
on the Closing Date. Each of  



 

59  Hurricane, MergerSub and Cyclone and each of their respective affiliates
shall use their best efforts not to take any action, or fail to take any
action, or cause any action to be taken or not taken, or suffer to exist any
condition, which action or failure to take action or condition would prevent,
or would be reasonably likely to prevent, the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

Section 8.13 _Affiliates_. Cyclone shall deliver to Hurricane a letter
identifying all known Persons who may be deemed affiliates of Cyclone under
Rule 145 of the 1933 Act, and thereafter Cyclone shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a written agreement from each Person who may be

by Article 2 of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act with respect to

Cyclone Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries as of the

operations, business or decision-making before the Effective Time, and
control over all such matters shall remain in the hands of the relevant
party, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no consent of any party
will be required with respect to any matter set forth in the Agreement to the
extent the requirement of such consent would violate Applicable Law.

Section 8.18 _Employee Matters_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Cyclone Employee Plans and the
Hurricane Employee Plans in effect at the Effective Time will remain in
effect (except as provided in Section 2.06) with respect to employees and
former employees of Cyclone or Hurricane and their Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and the dependents of such employees covered by such plans at the
Effective Time (the "Covered Employees"), until such time as Hurricane
otherwise determines, subject to Applicable Law, the terms of such plans and
this Section 8.18. Prior to the Effective Time, Hurricane and Cyclone acting
in good faith will cooperate in reviewing, evaluating and analyzing the
Cyclone Employee Plans and the Hurricane Employee Plans with a view towards
developing appropriate employee benefit and compensation plans, programs and
arrangements for Covered Employees after the Effective Time which, among other
things, (i) will treat similarly situated Covered Employees on a substantially
equivalent basis, taking into account all relevant factors, including duties,
responsibilities, geographic location, tenure, and qualifications and (ii)
will not discriminate between Covered Employees who at  



 

61  the Effective Time are covered by Cyclone Employee Plans, on the one hand,
and those covered by Hurricane Employee Plans, on the other hand, and
which Hurricane will adopt subject to customary rights to subsequently amend
or terminate such plans as Hurricane thereafter deems appropriate
(individually a "New Benefit Plan" and collectively the "New Benefits
Plans"). 

(b) Each New Benefit Plan will (i) provide all of the Covered Employees
eligible to participate in such plans with service credit for purposes of
eligibility, participation, vesting and levels of benefits (but not for
benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or any retiree medical
or other post-retirement welfare plan or as would otherwise result in a
duplication of benefits) for all periods of employment with Cyclone or
Hurricane or any of their respective Subsidiaries (or their predecessor
entities) prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cause any pre-existing conditions
or limitations, eligibility, waiting periods or required physical
examinations under any New Benefit Plan which is a welfare plan to be waived
with respect to the Covered Employees and their eligible dependents, to the
extent waived under the corresponding plan in which the applicable Covered
Employees participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and, with
respect to life insurance coverage, up to the Covered Employees current level
of insurability, and (iii) give the Covered Employees and their
eligible dependents credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time (or
the date of commencement of participation in such New Benefit Plan) occurs
towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses
incurred prior to the Effective Time (or the date of commencement of
participation in such New Benefit Plan).

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Cyclone shall make the payments
set forth in the change of control agreements referred to in _Section 8.18_
of the Cyclone Disclosure Schedule. _Section 8.18_ of the Cyclone Disclosure
Schedule also sets forth certain other employment arrangements to be entered
into by Cyclone as of the Effective Time.

(d) _Section 8.18_ of the Hurricane Disclosure Schedule sets forth certain
employment arrangements to be entered into by Hurricane as of the Effective
Time.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Hurricane will honor all accrued and
vested benefit obligations to and contractual rights of current and former
employees of Cyclone and Hurricane and their respective Subsidiaries under the
Cyclone Employee Plans or Hurricane Employee Plans, as applicable, to the
extent accrued and vested as of the Effective Time.

(f)(i) Nothing in this Section 8.18 shall be treated as an amendment of any
Cyclone Employee Plan or any Hurricane Employee Plan (or an undertaking to
amend any such plan), (ii) nothing in this Section 8.18 will prohibit
Hurricane from amending, modifying or terminating any Cyclone Employee Plan
or Hurricane Employee Plan pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms
thereof, and (iii) nothing in this Section 8.18 shall confer any rights or
benefits including, without limitation third party beneficiary rights, on any
person or employee other than Cyclone and Hurricane.

(g) From and after the Effective Time, Hurricane will enter into
an indemnification agreement with each Continuing Cyclone Director, such
indemnification agreement to be substantially in the form currently provided
to Hurricane directors.

Section 8.19 _Cyclone Debentures_. Each of Cyclone, Hurricane and Merger Sub
shall take each action required to be taken by such party pursuant to the
Indenture dated as of March 22, 2004, between Cyclone and U.S. Bank Trust
National Association, as trustee, with respect to the Cyclone Debentures, as
necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in compliance therewith.

Section 8.20 _Cooperation With Respect to Financing_. Except to the extent
prohibited by Applicable Law, Cyclone shall provide on a timely basis, and
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause its officers, employees
and advisers to provide on a timely basis, all reasonable cooperation in
connection with the arrangement of the financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter, or any alternative financing Hurricane  



 

62  may seek in order to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and to otherwise cooperate with Hurricane in
complying with its covenants under the Commitment Letter, including (i)
facilitating the pledge of collateral (effective as of the Closing), (ii)
providing financial and other pertinent information regarding Cyclone as may
be reasonably requested by Hurricane, including all financial statements and
financial data of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under
the 1933 Act in a registered offering of securities and by ratings and credit
agencies, (iii) providing other reasonably requested certificates or
documents, including a customary certificate of the chief financial officer of
Cyclone with respect to solvency matters, (iv) requesting Cyclones
independent auditors to provide customary consents and comfort letters and
(v) requesting such customary legal opinions as may be reasonably requested by
Hurricane. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be deemed to
require Cyclone to pay any fees to, or reimburse any expenses of, a Third
Party in connection with the arrangement of the financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter, or any alternative financing Hurricane may seek in order to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 

Section 8.21 _Rights Agreements._

(a) The Board of Directors of Cyclone shall take all further actions (in
addition to those referred to in Section 4.25) reasonably requested by
Hurricane in order to render the Cyclone Rights inapplicable to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, if the
Closing does not occur before September 5, 2007, Cyclone shall (i) amend the
Cyclone Rights Agreement in order to extend the date on which such
agreement expires to a date no earlier than the End Date (as such date may be
extended pursuant to this Agreement), or (ii) adopt a new rights agreement
containing substantially the same terms as the Cyclone Rights Agreement,
except that such agreement shall expire on a date no earlier than the End
Date (as such date may be extended pursuant to this Agreement). Except as
provided above with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Board of Directors of Cyclone shall not,
without the prior written consent of Hurricane, amend, take any action with
respect to, or make any determination under the Cyclone Rights Agreement
(including a redemption of the Cyclone Rights) to facilitate an
Acquisition Proposal.

(b) The Board of Directors of Hurricane shall take all further actions (in
addition to those referred to in Section 5.25) reasonably requested by
Cyclone in order to (i) render the Hurricane Rights inapplicable to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) ensure that
each share of Hurricane Stock received as part of the Merger Consideration
shall be accompanied by and issued together with an associated preferred share
purchase right pursuant to and in accordance with the Hurricane Rights
Agreement. Except as provided above with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Board of Directors of
Hurricane shall not, without the prior written consent of Cyclone, amend, take
any action with respect to, or make any determination under the Hurricane
Rights Agreement (including a redemption of the Hurricane Rights) to
facilitate an Acquisition Proposal.

other party as a result of such failure. The provisions of this Section 10.02
and Article 11 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section
10.01.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but subject to Section
11.04(e), in no event shall the total fees payable by Hurricane pursuant to
this Section 11.04(c) exceed the Cyclone Rejection Fee.

(d) Each of Hurricane and Cyclone acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 11.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, neither party would enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if Hurricane or Cyclone fails promptly
to pay any amount due to the other party pursuant to this Section 11.04, the
non-paying party shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by such other
party in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results
in a judgment against the non-paying party for that amount, together with
interest on the amount of any unpaid fee and/or expense at the publicly
announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date that fee was required to
be paid to, but excluding, the payment date.

(e) Any payment by any other party under this Section 11.04 shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the other such party and its Subsidiaries for damages
against the other such party and any of its Subsidiaries and their  



 

69  respective Representatives with respect to the termination or breach giving
rise to that payment; provided, however, that nothing herein shall relieve
any party from any further liability for any willful or intentional breach of
any material covenant or agreement of such party contained herein. For the
avoidance of doubt, any payment to be made by any party under this Section
11.04 shall be payable only once to such other party with respect to this
Section 11.04 and not in duplication even though such payment may be payable
under one or more provisions hereof.

Section 11.05 _Disclosure Schedule References_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement that may be deemed to the contrary:

(a) Any reference in a particular Section of either the Cyclone Disclosure
Schedule or the Hurricane Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be
an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant
party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and
(ii) any other representations and warranties of such party that are
contained in this Agreement, but only in each case if the relevance of that
reference as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such
representations and warranties would be readily apparent on its face to a
reasonable person who has read that reference and such representations and
warranties, without any independent knowledge on the part of the reader
regarding the matter(s) so disclosed. The mere inclusion of an item in either
the Cyclone Disclosure Schedule or the Hurricane Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission
that such item represents a material exception or material fact, event or
circumstance or that such item has had or would be reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Cyclone or Hurricane, as applicable; and

(b) any information contained in any part of any Cyclone SEC Document or of
any Hurricane SEC Document shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) the representations and warranties
of the relevant party if the relevance of that information as an exception to
(or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties would be
readily apparent on its face to a reasonable person who has read that
information and such representations and warranties, without any independent
knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed,
provided that in no event shall any information contained in any part of any
Cyclone SEC Document or of any Hurricane SEC Document entitled "Risk Factors"
or "Forward-Looking Statements" be deemed to be an exception to (or, as
applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) any representation(s) and
warranty(ies) of Cyclone or Hurricane that is contained in this Agreement. 

Section 11.06 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_.

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as
provided in Section 8.05 and Section 8.18(g), shall inure to the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Except as
provided in Section 8.05 and Section 8.18(g), no provision of this Agreement
is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations
or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the written consent of each other
party hereto, except that any party may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to
(i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the Effective
Time, to any Person; provided that such transfer or assignment shall not
relieve such party of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change
any obligation of any other party hereto or due to such party.

Section 11.07 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

Section 11.08 _Jurisdiction_. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions  



 

70  contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal court located in the
State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any
party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any
such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of
process on such party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed effective
service of process on such party.

Section 11.09 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

Section 11.10 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

Section 11.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the exhibits, schedules and annexes hereto constitute
the entire agreement between the parties with respect to their subject matter
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written,
between the parties with respect to that subject matter.

Section 11.12 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 11.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof (and, more specifically, that irreparable
damage would likewise occur if the Merger were not consummated and the
affected partys stockholders did not receive the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable to them in accordance with the terms but subject to the
conditions of this Agreement), and, accordingly, that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof
(including the parties obligation to consummate the Merger and Hurricanes
obligation to pay, and the affected partys stockholders right to receive,
the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to them pursuant to the Merger,
subject in each case to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) in any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Section 11.14 _Matters Related to HSR_. The parties acknowledge and agree
that, for all purposes of this Agreement, no party makes any representation
or warranty regarding the effect of the HSR Act or any foreign antitrust or
competition law on such partys ability to execute, deliver, or perform its
obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Merger as a result of
the enactment, promulgation, application, or threatened or actual judicial or
administrative investigation or litigation under, or enforcement of, the HSR
Act or any foreign antitrust or competition law with respect to the
consummation of the Merger.
