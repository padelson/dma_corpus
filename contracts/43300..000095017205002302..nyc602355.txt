Section 8.2(a)(i) ("METRO CLAIM") unless and until the aggregate amount of
Losses incurred by all the Metro Indemnified Parties in respect of Metro

Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for only the amount in excess of
the Basket; and (ii) in no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses for
which the AandP; Parties are obligated to indemnify the Metro Indemnified
Parties pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) exceed $180,000,000 in the aggregate

entitled to indemnification for only the amount in excess of the Basket; and
(ii) in no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses for which the Metro

INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES.   (a) In the event that any Action is commenced
by a third party involving a claim for which a party required to provide
indemnification hereunder (an "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") may be liable to a party
entitled to indemnification (an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") hereunder (an "ASSERTED
LIABILITY"), the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying
Party in writing of such Asserted Liability (the "CLAIM NOTICE"); provided
that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in giving any such Claim
Notice shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation
hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by
such delay. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days from its receipt of the
Claim Notice (the "NOTICE PERIOD") to notify the Indemnified Party whether or
not the Indemnifying Party desires, at the Indemnifying Party\'s sole cost
and expense and by counsel of its own choosing, to defend against such
Asserted Liability. If the Indemnifying Party undertakes to defend against
such Asserted Liability, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to defend and protect the interests of the Indemnified Party
with respect to such Asserted Liability and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall
not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to
any settlement which does not contain an unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party from the subject matter of the settlement or that contains
an admission of liability or wrongdoing. The Indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate in the defence against any Asserted Liability at its own
expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any event, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to control, pay or settle any Asserted Liability which
the Indemnifying Party shall have undertaken to defend so long as the
Indemnified Party shall also waive any right to indemnification therefor by
the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party undertakes to defend
against such Asserted Liability, the Indemnified Party shall fully render to
the Indemnifying Party and its counsel such assistance and cooperation as
may be required to ensure the proper and adequate defence and settlement of
such claim or demand.   (b) If the Indemnifying Party does not undertake
within the Notice Period to defend against such Asserted Liability, then the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in any such defence and
the Indemnifying Party shall bear the reasonable costs and expenses of
the Indemnified Party of such defence. In such case, the Indemnified Party
shall control the investigation and defence and may settle or take any other
actions the Indemnified Party deems reasonably advisable without in any way
waiving or otherwise affecting the Indemnified Party\'s rights to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement. The Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party agree to make available to each other, their counsel and
other representatives, all information and documents available to them which
relate to such claim or demand. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party also agree to render to each other such assistance and cooperation as
may reasonably be required to ensure the proper and adequate defence and
settlement of such claim or demand.   (c) In calculating amounts payable to
an Indemnified Party, the amount of any indemnified Losses shall be
determined without duplication of any other Loss for which an indemnification
claim has been made or could be made under any other representation,
warranty, covenant, or agreement and shall be computed net of (i) payments
recoverable by the Indemnified Party under any insurance policy with respect
to such Losses, (ii) any prior or subsequent recovery by the Indemnified
Party from any Person with respect to such Losses and (iii) any Tax benefit
receivable by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Losses.   (d)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall any
Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification (i) pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(i) or Section 8.3(a)(i), as the case may be, as to any fact, matter,
circumstance or event of which such Indemnified Party had knowledge prior to
Closing or (ii) pursuant to this Article VIII to the extent any Losses were
attributable to such Indemnified Party\'s own gross negligence or
willful misconduct.   (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, claims pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i) and (ii) and Section
8.3(a)(i) and (ii) for indemnification with respect to the representations,
warranties and covenants made by the AandP; Parties or the Metro Parties may
not be made after the expiration of the applicable time period set forth in
Section 8.1(a). Claims for indemnification made with reasonable specificity
by the Indemnified Party within the time periods set forth in this Section
8.4(e) shall survive until such claim is finally and fully resolved.   (f)
To the extent that an Indemnifying Party makes any payment pursuant to this
Article VIII in respect of Losses for which an Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates have a right to recover against a third party (including an
insurance company), the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the right
of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates to seek and obtain recovery
from such third party; provided, however, that if the Indemnifying Party
shall be prohibited from such subrogation, the Metro Parties or
its Affiliates, as applicable, shall seek recovery from such third party on
the Indemnifying Party\'s behalf and pay any such recovery to Indemnifying
Party.   (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in
no event shall any of the AandP; Parties or the Metro Parties be liable for
punitive damages or any special, incidental, indirect or consequential
damages of any kind or nature, regardless of the form of action through which
such damages are sought. In no event shall any of the AandP; Parties or the
Metro Parties be liable for lost profits resulting from an alleged breach of
this Agreement, even if under applicable Law, such lost profits would not be
considered consequential or special damages.   (h) The remedies provided in
this Article VIII shall be deemed the sole and exclusive remedies of the
parties, from and after the Closing Date, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, absent fraud.   ARTICLE IX  
MISCELLANEOUS   SECTION 9.1 ASSIGNMENT; BINDING EFFECT. This Agreement and
the rights hereunder are not assignable unless such assignment is consented
to in writing by each of the Metro Parties and the AandP; Parties; provided,
however, that the Metro Parties and the AandP; Parties may without such consent
in writing, assign, directly or indirectly, their respective rights (but not
their respective obligations) hereunder to any of their respective wholly
owned Subsidiaries, provided that no such assignment shall relieve such
parties of their obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding clause, this
Agreement and all the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.   SECTION 9.2 CHOICE OF LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by

SECTION 9.3 DISPUTE RESOLUTION.   (a) Notice; Negotiation. Any dispute,

connection with this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, including any
question regarding its negotiation, existence, validity, interpretation,
performance, breach or termination ("DISPUTE"), which cannot be resolved by
the Parties within 14 days of receipt by a party of a written notice of
dispute ("NOTICE"), shall be referred to the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs)
of the Parties who shall meet within 30 days of receipt of Notice, to attempt
to resolve such Dispute, subject to obtaining any necessary corporate
approvals of such resolution.   (b) Arbitration. Any Dispute not resolved
for any reason pursuant to the process contemplated by Section 9.3(a) within
45 days of receipt of Notice, but excluding any dispute, difference,
disagreement, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with the
Confidentiality Agreements, or any of the matters referred to in Section 2.3
(Purchase Price Adjustment), shall be finally settled under the Rules of
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce ("ICC RULES").   (i)
Number of Arbitrators. Where the amount in Dispute  (including all claims and
counterclaims) is less than or equal to two  million dollars ($2,000,000)
exclusive of interest and costs, the Dispute  shall be finally settled by a
sole arbitrator nominated by the parties  within 30 days of receipt by
respondent of the request for arbitration, or,  in default thereof appointed
in accordance with the ICC Rules. Where the  amount in Dispute is greater
than two million dollars ($2,000,000),  exclusive of interest and costs, the
Dispute shall be finally settled by  three (3) arbitrators. Each Party shall
nominate one arbitrator in  accordance with the ICC Rules. The two (2)
arbitrators so nominated shall  appoint the presiding arbitrator within 20
days of the confirmation of the  appointment of the second arbitrator. If
either Party fails to timely  nominate an arbitrator, such arbitrator shall
be appointed by the ICC  International Court of Arbitration ("ICC COURT"). If
the two (2)  arbitrators nominated by the parties fail to agree upon a third
arbitrator  within 30 days of the confirmation of the appointment of the
second  arbitrator, the presiding arbitrator shall be appointed by the ICC
Court.   (ii) Place and Language of Arbitration. The arbitration  shall
take place in Toronto, Ontario. The language of the arbitration shall  be
English.   (iii) Commencement of Arbitration. Either party shall  commence
the arbitration by filing a Request for Arbitration (as defined in  the ICC
Rules).   (c) Hearing; Award. The Parties shall use their
reasonable efforts to cause the hearing on the merits to take place within
120 days of the appointment of either the sole arbitrator or the last of the
three (3) arbitrators, as the case may be. The arbitration award shall be in
writing, shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for the decision and
shall be rendered within 30 days of the end of the hearing where there is a
sole arbitrator, and within 60 days of the end of the hearing where there are
three (3) arbitrators. Judgment upon any award(s) rendered by the
arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  
(d) Costs of the Arbitration. Subject to any award of costs by the
arbitrator(s), each of the parties shall bear one-half of the costs of
the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator(s) and any
expert appointed by the arbitrator(s), and each party shall bear all legal
and other costs incurred by it in connection with the arbitration.   (e)
Provisional Measures. For the purposes of any provisional or interim measure
in aid of the arbitration proceedings, the parties hereby submit to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of the competent court in the Province of Ontario,
City of Toronto. Without prejudice to such provisional or interim remedies in
aid of arbitration as may be available under the jurisdiction of a competent
court, the arbitrator(s) shall have full authority to grant provisional or
interim remedies and to award damages for the failure of a party to respect
any order of the arbitrator(s) to that effect.   (f) Consolidation. In order
to facilitate the comprehensive resolution of related Disputes, all claims
between any of the parties to this Agreement that arise under or in
connection with this Agreement and/or any Ancillary Agreement may be brought
in a single arbitration. Upon the request of any party to such arbitration,
the arbitral tribunal for such proceeding shall consolidate any arbitration
proceeding constituted under this Agreement and/or any Ancillary Agreement
with any other arbitration proceeding constituted under this Agreement and/or
any Ancillary Agreement, if the arbitral tribunal determines that (i) there
are issues of fact or law common to the proceedings so that a consolidated
proceeding would be more efficient than separate proceedings, and (ii) no
party would be unduly prejudiced as a result of such consolidation through
undue delay or otherwise. In the event of different rulings on this question
by the arbitral tribunal constituted hereunder and another arbitral tribunal
constituted under this Agreement and/or any Ancillary Agreement, the ruling
of the arbitral tribunal constituted first in time shall control. Such
arbitral tribunal shall serve as the tribunal for any
consolidated arbitration. Any such order of consolidation issued by such
arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding upon the parties to the
arbitrations. The parties to such arbitrations waive any right they have to
appeal or to seek interpretation, revision or annulment of such order of
consolidation under the ICC Rules or in any court. The parties agree that
upon receipt of such an order of consolidation, they will promptly dismiss
any arbitration brought under this Section 9.3 or any Ancillary Agreement,
the subject of which has been consolidated into another arbitral proceeding
under this Section 9.3.   SECTION 9.4 NOTICES. All notices, requests,
demands and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and
