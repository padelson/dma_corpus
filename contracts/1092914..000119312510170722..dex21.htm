REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

 

Buyer hereby makes the representations and warranties to Seller set forth in
this _Article IV_.

 

4.1 _Organization and Qualification_. Buyer is a limited partnership duly
formed, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware and has all requisite limited partnership power and authority to
conduct its business as it is now being conducted and to own, lease, and
operate its property and assets except where the failure to be so
formed, existing, and in good standing or to have such power or authority
would not, in the aggregate, have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.2 _Authority_. Buyer has all requisite limited partnership authority and
power to execute and deliver the Transaction Documents. The execution and
delivery of the Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents have been duly and validly
authorized by all required limited partnership action on the part of Buyer,
and no other proceedings on the part of Buyer are necessary to authorize the
Transaction Documents or to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents. This Agreement has been, and the other Transaction
Documents will be, duly and 



 

28  validly executed and delivered by Buyer, and, assuming the Transaction
Documents have been duly authorized, executed, and delivered by Seller, the
Transaction Documents shall constitute valid and binding agreements of Buyer,
enforceable against Buyer in accordance with their terms, except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other
similar Laws now or hereinafter in effect relating to or affecting creditors
rights generally, general equitable principles (whether considered in a
proceeding in equity or at Law), and considerations of public policy,
including the effect of statutory and other Laws regarding fraudulent
conveyances and preferential transfers.

4.3 _No Conflicts_. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.3_ , neither the
execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents by Buyer nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents by
Buyer will: (a) violate any provision of the limited partnership agreement (or
other comparable governing documents) of Buyer, (b) require the consent,
waiver, or approval of any Governmental Authority, except for (i) consents and
approvals to be made and obtained before the Closing and those which have been
made and obtained and (ii) such consents and approvals as, if not made or
obtained, will not, in the aggregate, have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect,
(c) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without notice
or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, acceleration, or any obligation to repay) under,
any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of any indenture, mortgage, note,
bond, encumbrance, license, contract, lease, franchise, permit, agreement, or
other instrument or obligation to which Buyer is a party or by which Buyer or
any of its properties or assets may be bound, except for such violations,
breaches and defaults as, in the aggregate, will not have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect, or (d) violate any Law applicable to Buyer or by
which any of its properties or assets may be bound, except for such violations
as, in the aggregate, will not have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 

4.4 _Litigation_. There are no actions, suits, or proceedings pending or, to
the Knowledge of Buyer, threatened in writing against Buyer before any court,
arbitrator, or governmental or regulatory body or authority that would
reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely
affect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by Buyer.

4.5 _Brokerage Agreements_. Buyer has not entered (directly or indirectly)
into any agreement with any Person for the payment of any commission,
brokerage or "finders fee" in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement for which Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates would be
liable.

 

4.6 _Investment Intent_. Buyer is acquiring the Equity Interests for its own
account for investment and not with a view towards the resale, transfer, or
distribution thereof, nor with any present intention of distributing the
Equity Interests, in violation of the Securities Act, other applicable federal
or state securities laws and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Buyer acknowledges that the Equity Interests have not
been registered under the Securities Act or other applicable federal or state
securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, by
reason of the contemplated sale of the Equity Interests in a transaction
exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and state
securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Buyer
represents that it is fully informed as to the 



 

29  applicable limitations upon any distribution or resale of the Equity
Interests under the Securities Act and other applicable federal and state
securities laws, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and
Buyer agrees that it will refrain from transferring, distributing or otherwise
disposing of the Equity Interests, or any interest therein, in such manner as
to violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act or of any
applicable federal or state securities Law and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder. Buyer is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule
501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act.

 

4.7 _Availability of Funds_. At the Closing, Buyer shall have funds sufficient
to fund the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and satisfy all other costs and expenses arising in connection therewith for
which Buyer is responsible.

 

4.8 _Independent Investigation; Representations_. Buyer has conducted its own
independent investigation, review and analysis of the assets and liabilities
of the Elk City Entities and prospects of the Elk City Business, which
investigation, review and analysis was done by Buyer and the Buyer
Representatives. Buyer acknowledges that it and the Buyer Representatives have
been provided adequate access to the personnel, properties, premises and
records of the Elk City Business for such purpose. In entering into this
Agreement, Buyer acknowledges that it has relied solely upon the
aforementioned investigation, review and analysis and not on any factual
representations or opinions of Seller or the Seller Representatives (except
the specific representations and warranties of Seller set forth in _Article
III_ of this Agreement and in the other Transaction Documents). Buyer hereby
acknowledges and agrees that other than the representations and warranties
made in _Article III_ of this Agreement and in the other Transaction
Documents, none of Seller or any of the Seller Representatives makes or
has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, at law or in
equity, with respect to the Elk City Business, or the assets or liabilities of
the Elk City Entities, including as to (i) the operation of the Elk City
Business after the Closing, or (ii) the probable success or profitability of
the Elk City Business after the Closing.

actions and to make, or cause to be made, all filings necessary, proper or
advisable under any Antitrust Law and all other applicable Laws to consummate

the assignment of any contract or agreement which is described on _Schedule
3.5(b)_ and non-assignable without the consent of the other party or parties
thereto, unless such consent shall have been given. In no event shall

(a) Each of the Parties shall (and shall cause its respective Affiliates to)
use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate actions and to make, or cause to be made, all filings necessary,
proper or advisable under any Antitrust Law to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to respond to any
government requests for information under any Antitrust Law. Each Party will,
within ten Business Days after the date hereof, file (or cause its appropriate
Affiliate to file) with the appropriate Governmental Authorities the
notification and report form required for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and any supplemental information requested in connection
therewith pursuant to any Antitrust Law, which filing will include a request
for early termination of any applicable waiting period. Each Party will use
all commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another in making
the filings and submissions referred to above, and each Party will furnish, or
cause to be furnished, to the other any necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other Party may request in connection with their preparation
of any filing or submission that is necessary or advisable under any Antitrust
Law. Such notification and report form and all such supplemental information
filed or submitted by such Party (or such Affiliate) will be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of the relevant Antitrust Law. Each Party
will use all commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if
any, as the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other Person may assert
under any relevant Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party will keep the other Party
reasonably informed, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, of the status
of any communications with, and inquiries or requests for additional
information from, any Governmental Authority in connection with the matters
contemplated by this _Section 5.3(a)_, and will use all commercially
reasonable efforts to comply (and, if applicable, cause the compliance by its
appropriate Affiliates) promptly with any such inquiry or request and to
defend against any action of any Governmental Authority or other Person that
attempts to enjoin the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party
will, and will cause its Affiliates to, use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the expiration or early termination of the
waiting period under any applicable Antitrust Law. The costs of any filing
fees required in connection with any filing made under any Antitrust Law shall
be borne equally between Buyer and Seller.

(b) In the event that the FTC or the DOJ issues a Request for Additional
Information and Documentary Material under the HSR Act (a " _Second Request_
") in relation to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the
Parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to limit the scope of
such Second Request, certify substantial compliance with such Second Request
and otherwise respond to and seek to resolve any requests for information,
documents, data or testimony made by the FTC or the DOJ under the HSR Act.

 



 

33 (c) The Parties shall not take any action with the intention to or that could
reasonably be expected to hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or any
necessary approval of any Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law or
the expiration or early termination of any required waiting period thereunder.

 

5.4 _Liability for Transfer Taxes_. Buyer shall be responsible for the payment
of all sales (including bulk sales, if applicable), use, value added,
documentary, stamp, gross receipts, registration, transfer, conveyance,
excise, recording, license, notary and other similar Taxes, levies, charges
and fees, including all interest and penalties thereon and additions
thereto, whether disputed or not (" _Transfer Taxes_ "), arising out of or in
connection with or attributable to the transactions effected pursuant to this
Agreement. The Party required by Law to file all necessary Tax Returns
relating to such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and file such Tax Returns, and
Buyer and Seller shall each, and shall each cause their Affiliates to,
cooperate to minimize the incurrence of any such Transfer Taxes, and with
respect to any such Transfer Taxes due, in the timely preparation and filing
of, and join in the execution of, any such Tax Returns.

5.5 _Notice of Certain Events_. From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of (a) the Closing Date and (b) the date this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with the provisions hereof, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer
of the commencement of any suit, action, claim, arbitration or investigation
against Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting the Elk City Business or any of the Elk City Entities of
which Seller has Knowledge.

 

5.6 _Supplements to Schedules_. From time to time until the Closing, Seller
shall have the right to modify, supplement or amend the Schedules that Seller
delivered and attached to this Agreement as of the date hereof with respect to
any matter relating to the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article III_ and first existing or occurring following the date of
this Agreement that (a) if existing or occurring at or prior to the date of
this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such
Schedules, or (b) is necessary to correct any information in such Schedules
that has been rendered inaccurate thereby; _provided, however_ , that Seller
shall not have the right to modify, supplement or amend any such Schedule with
respect to any matter which resulted from or was incidental to a breach by
Seller of the covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement. No
modification, supplement, or amendment to such Schedules shall have any effect
for purposes of determining whether the conditions set forth in _Article VI_
have been fulfilled, but shall for all other purposes amend and cure any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty of this Agreement; and if the Closing
occurs, then any matters disclosed by Seller to Buyer pursuant to any such
modification, supplement, or amendment after the date hereof but prior to the
Closing shall be deemed a waiver by Buyer of the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.1(a)(i)_ with respect thereto. References in this Agreement to
Schedules shall be to the Schedules as may be modified, supplemented,
or amended from time to time in accordance with this _Section 5.6_.

5.7 _Access_.

 

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Closing or the
prior termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, Buyer and its
counsel, accountants, financial advisors, potential financial sources,
employees, agents and other

 



 

34  authorized representatives (the " _Buyer Representatives_ ") shall be given
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice, to the facilities, properties, personnel, books and records
(including, without limitation, Tax records) of Seller (with respect to the
Elk City Entities or the Elk City Business) and the Elk City Entities for the
purpose of conducting an investigation of the Elk City Business, the Elk City
Entities and their financial condition, operations, status, properties and
assets; _provided, however_ , that (i) Buyer and the Buyer Representatives
will not request information, or otherwise contact, any officer, director or
employee of Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates without arranging such
contact with either Glenn Powell or Gerald R. Shrader, and (ii) such
investigation shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the normal operations of the Elk City Entities. Seller will,
and will cause the Elk City Entities to, cause their respective counsel,
accountants, financial advisors, employees, agents and other authorized
representatives (the " _Seller Representatives_ ") to be available to Buyer
and the Buyer Representatives at all reasonable times, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable prior notice, for such purposes. Seller shall have
the right to have a Seller Representative present at all times during any
such inspections, interviews and examinations. Additionally, Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Buyer Representatives to, hold in confidence all such
information provided to Buyer or the Buyer Representatives pursuant to this
_Section 5.7_ on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have no right of access to, and
Seller shall have no obligation to provide to Buyer, information relating to
(i) bids received from others in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (or similar transactions) and information and analyses
(including financial analyses) relating to such bids or (ii) any information
the disclosure of which would result in a violation of Law. To the extent
reasonably practicable, Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which the restriction of the preceding sentence
applies.

(c) Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties and their respective
representatives, and save them harmless, effective as and from the date
hereof, from and against any Damages that they or any of them may suffer or
incur, or that may be made or brought against any of them, as a result of, in
respect of, or arising out of any injury to the person or property of Buyer or
the Buyer Representatives as a result of, or in connection with any site
visits or inspections of the assets or properties of any Seller
Indemnified Party. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IN THIS _SECTION 5.7_ SHALL
BE ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING THE PERSON FROM
WHOM INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT) ALLEGES OR PROVES THE SOLE, CONCURRENT,
CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PERSON SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION
OR THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON THE PERSON SEEKING
INDEMNIFICATION; PROVIDED, THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL BUYER BE REQUIRED TO
INDEMNIFY ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY UNDER THIS  _SECTION 5.7_ FOR ANY
DAMAGES RESULTING FROM, IN RESPECT OF OR ARISING OUT OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE
OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTY.



 

35 (d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, Seller shall, in
accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement, request
from each bidder that entered into a confidentiality agreement with Seller or
one of Sellers Affiliates regarding the possible acquisition by such bidder
of the Equity Interests or the Assets, that such bidder return to the Elk
City Entities any and all confidential information relating to any of the Elk
City Entities previously furnished to such bidder.

 

5.8 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns and Paying Taxes_. Seller shall
prepare and file all Tax Returns required to be filed on or prior to the
Closing Date by or with respect to any of the Elk City Entities and shall pay
all Taxes due on or prior to the Closing Date from any of the Elk City
Entities. In addition, with respect to any Tax Return required to be filed
after the Closing Date by or for any of the Elk City Entities for a Prior Tax
Period, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a draft of such Tax Return, along with a
supporting calculation of the amount of Taxes due from each of the Elk City
Entities, on or prior to the date that is 30 days prior to the due date for
filing such Tax Return (or, if such due date is within 30 days after the tax
period ends, as soon as reasonably practicable). With respect to any Tax
Return required to be filed after the Closing Date by or for any of the Elk
City Entities for a Straddle Tax Period, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a draft
of such Tax Return, along with a statement of the amount of Taxes due each of
the Elk City Entities for the Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to such Tax
Return, on or prior to the date that is 30 days prior to the due date for
filing such Tax Return (or, if such due date is within 30 days after the tax
period ends, as soon as reasonably practicable). On or before the date that
is five days prior to the due date for payment of any Taxes due from any of
the Elk City Entities for a Prior Tax Period or a Straddle Tax Period, Seller
shall remit to Buyer an amount in cash equal to the excess (if any) of (i)
the amount of Taxes due from such Elk City Entity for the Pre-Closing Tax
Period, over (ii) the amount (if any) set forth as a liability for such Tax in
the Final Closing Statement. Subject to the satisfaction of the obligations of
Seller hereunder, Buyer shall file (or cause to be filed) any Tax Returns
required to be filed after the Closing Date and pay (or cause to be paid) any
Taxes due after the Closing Date, in each case with respect to any of Elk City
Entities for a Prior Tax Period or a Straddle Tax Period.

(b) _Tax Refunds_. Buyer shall pay to Seller within 30 Business Days
of receipt any amounts received as a refund of Taxes paid by any of Elk City
Entities with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period provided (i) the refund does
not result from or relate to the carryback of any loss, deduction, credit or
other Tax item arising or accruing in a Post-Closing Tax Period and (ii) the
refund was not reflected as an asset (or reduction of a liability) on the
Final Settlement Statement.

 

(c) _Straddle Period Taxes_. Liability for Taxes for any Straddle Tax Period
shall be apportioned as follows: (i) property and similar ad valorem Taxes
shall be apportioned on a ratable daily basis and (ii) all other Taxes,
including income Taxes, shall be apportioned based on an interim closing of
the books of each appropriate Elk City Entity as of the end of the Closing
Date. Any franchise Tax paid or payable with respect to any of the Elk City
Entities shall be allocated to the Tax period during which

 



 

36  the gross receipts, income, operations, assets or capital comprising the
base of such Tax is measured, regardless of whether the right to do business
for another period is obtained by the payment of such franchise Tax.

(d) _Information Sharing; Disputes over Tax Provisions_. Buyer and Seller
shall each provide the other with all information reasonably requested and
necessary to prepare a Tax Return or conduct an audit or contest with respect
to Taxes. The Accountant shall resolve any dispute between Buyer and Seller
over the application of this _Section 5.8_ substantially in the manner
described in _Section 2.4(e)_.

(e) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any Tax sharing agreement between any of the
Elk City Entities and Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates (other than any of
the Elk City Entities) shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and shall
have no further effect with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Post-
Closing Tax Period.

(f) _Seller s or Buyers Like Kind Exchange_. The purchase of all or a
portion of the Equity Interests pursuant to this Agreement may be part of a
transaction intended to qualify as an exchange under Section 1031 of the Code.
Each of Seller and Buyer agrees to allow an assignment of the others
interest in this Agreement to an exchange facilitator to effect the exchange,
provided that such assignment does not affect the timing or obtaining of any
consents or approvals required for the transactions contemplated hereby. Such
assignment shall not relieve the assigning Party of any of its rights and
obligations hereunder or expand any liabilities or obligations of the other
Party under this Agreement. Each of Seller and Buyer further agrees to
otherwise cooperate to accomplish such exchange. Neither Seller nor Buyer
makes any representations as to any particular tax treatment that may be
afforded to Buyer or Seller, respectively, by reason of such assignment, and
neither Buyer nor Seller shall be obligated to pay any additional costs or
incur any additional obligations hereunder as a result of such exchange by
Seller or Buyer, respectively. The Party effecting such exchange hereby agrees
to pay all costs incurred by the other Party associated with any such
exchange and to indemnify and hold such other Party harmless from and against
any and all claims, losses, liabilities (including reasonable attorneys fees,
court costs and related expenses) and Taxes arising out of such exchange.

(g) _Tax Treatment of Purchase of Equity Interests_. As a result of each
of the Elk City Entities being a Disregarded Entity at the time of the
Closing for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and state and local Tax purposes
where applicable), Buyer and Seller intend that the purchase of the Equity
Interests pursuant to this Agreement be treated for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes (and state, local, and foreign Tax purposes where applicable) as the
purchase by Buyer of all the Assets. Buyer and Seller agree to report and file
(and cause their Affiliates to report and file) their U.S. federal income Tax
Returns (and state and local income Tax Returns where applicable) in all
respects and for all purposes consistent with such intended treatment. Buyer
and Seller further agree not to take (and to cause their respective
Affiliates not to take) any position, whether in any Tax Return, audit,
examination, claim, adjustment, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
U.S. federal income Tax (and state and local income Tax purposes where
applicable), which is inconsistent with such intended treatment.



 

37 (h) _Seller Responsibility for Pre-Closing Tax Periods_. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein or as to amounts set forth as a liability for Tax on
the Final Closing Statement, Seller will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against all Damages for, arising out
of, resulting from, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by (i) all Taxes
(or the non-payment thereof) of any of the Elk City Entities, Seller or
Sellers Affiliates for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, including, without
limitation, any Taxes imposed in connection with the deemed sale of the
Assets resulting from consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (ii) the purchase of the Equity Interests pursuant to this
Agreement not being treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and state,
local and foreign Tax purposes where applicable) as the purchase by Buyer of
all of the Assets as a result of a breach of any representation or warranty
contained in _Section 3.13(h)_ or  _Section 3.13(i)_.

5.9 _Release of Seller s Security_. Buyer shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to replace, not later than 30 days after the Closing Date,
all Sellers Security listed in Part I of _Schedule 3.14_ (other than cash
collateral, which shall be deemed replaced upon the satisfaction of the
delivery requirement set forth in _Section 2.2(c)(v)_), with new letters of
credit, guaranties, or other security for post-Closing Date business
operations of the Elk City Entities, so as to enable Seller to secure a
release of the corresponding Sellers Security. If Buyer is unable to replace
any such Sellers Security, Buyer agrees to and shall reimburse Seller for all
amounts paid and expenses incurred by Seller from and after the Closing Date
under or in connection with any demand upon any of such Sellers Security
related to post-Closing Date transactions and shall reimburse Seller upon
demand for Sellers out-of-pocket costs for providing such corresponding
Sellers Security for the period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing
until Buyer has replaced such Sellers Security so as to enable Seller to
secure a release of such Sellers Security. Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to replace or release as soon as reasonably possible after
the Closing Date the Sellers Security listed in Part II of _Schedule 3.14_.
Buyer agrees to cooperate with Seller to provide Seller with information that
Seller may reasonably require to replace or release such Sellers Security.
Seller agrees to and shall reimburse Buyer for all amounts paid and expenses
incurred by any of the Elk City Entities from and after the Closing Date under
or in connection with any demand upon such Sellers Security and Seller
shall reimburse Buyer upon demand for any out-of-pocket costs incurred by any
of the Elk City Entities for providing such Sellers Security for the period
beginning on the Closing Date and continuing until Seller replaces or releases
such Sellers Security. Any conditions or limitations set forth in _Article
VII_ with respect to the monetary amount of claims or liability shall not
apply to any claim or liability to which this _Section 5.9_ applies or to any
breach of any obligation under this _Section 5.9_. In the event of any
inconsistency between provisions of _Article VII_ and this _Section 5.9_,
this _Section 5.9_ shall control.

 

5.10 _Seller Marks_. Buyer shall obtain no right, title, interest, license or
any other right whatsoever to use the words "Atlas" or "Atlas Pipeline" or
any trademarks containing or comprising the foregoing, or any trademark
confusingly similar thereto or dilutive thereof (collectively, the " _Seller
Marks_ "). From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees that it shall (a) cause
the Elk City Entities to cease using the Seller Marks in any manner, directly
or indirectly, except for such limited uses as cannot be promptly terminated (
_e.g._ , signage and other matters addressed in _Section 5.10(b)_), and to
cease such limited usage of the Seller Marks as promptly as reasonably
possible after the Closing and in any event within 90 days following the 



 

38  Closing Date, and (b) remove, strike over or otherwise obliterate all Seller
Marks from (i) all signs at the field offices owned, possessed or used by the
Elk City Entities within 30 days after the Closing Date and (ii) all other
assets and materials owned, possessed or used by the Elk City Entities within
180 days after the Closing Date. The Parties agree, because damages would be
an inadequate remedy, that a Party seeking to enforce this _Section 5.10_
shall be entitled to seek specific performance and injunctive relief as
remedies for any breach thereof in addition to other remedies available at law
or in equity. This covenant shall survive indefinitely without limitation as
to time.

5.11 _Books and Records_. From and after the Closing:

 

(a) Seller shall deliver to Buyer within 10 days after the Closing all of the
data room materials and other books and records relating to the business or
operations of the Elk City Entities on or before the Closing Date (the " _Elk
City Documents_ "), and Seller and its respective Affiliates may retain a copy
of any or all of the Elk City Documents other than any contracts or
agreements (and any files, information, correspondence and summaries related
thereto other than working papers used in the preparation of financial
statements) included in the Elk City Documents.

 

(b) Buyer shall preserve and keep a copy of the Elk City Documents delivered
by Seller to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement for a period of at least seven
years after the Closing Date (the " _Retention Period_ "). Buyer shall provide
to Seller, at no cost or expense to Seller, reasonable access (during normal
business hours and upon reasonable prior notice) to the Elk City Documents as
remain in Buyers possession and reasonable access (during normal business
hours and upon reasonable prior notice) to the properties and employees of
Buyer and the Elk City Entities in connection with matters relating to the
business or operations of the Elk City Entities on or before the Closing Date
and any disputes relating to this Agreement.

 

5.12 _Notifications and Business Permits_. Buyer shall provide all notices and
otherwise take all actions required to transfer or reissue the Business
Permits listed on _Schedule 3.5(a)(i)_. Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer to provide information necessary to
apply for such Business Permits.

 

5.13 _Confidentiality and Use of Information_.

 

(a) For two years after the Closing, except as required by any applicable Law,
Governmental Authority, or applicable stock exchange rule, Seller and its
Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose to any Person or use
any information (i) contained in the Elk City Documents; (ii) not then in the
public domain or generally known in the industry; or (iii) acquired on a
confidential basis from a source who, to the knowledge of Seller, was bound by
an agreement with Buyer, any of the Elk City Entities or any other Person to
keep such information confidential or otherwise prohibited from transmitting
the information to Seller or any of its Affiliates by a contractual, legal or
fiduciary obligation, in each case, acquired prior to the Closing Date, and
relating to the Elk City Business (and not any other business of Seller), the
Elk City Entities or the Assets (collectively, the " _Buyer Protected
Information_ "), _provided however_ , that Seller and its

 



 

39  Affiliates may use the Elk City Documents and Buyer Protected Information to
the extent reasonably necessary, in connection with any dispute or claim,
regarding (A) any Tax matter relating to Sellers prior ownership of the Elk
City Entities or (B) the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents.

 

(b) If at any time Buyer reasonably believes that Third Party Purchaser is or
may be violating its obligations to Seller under the Third Party
Confidentiality Agreement with respect to information provided by Seller to
Third Party Purchaser regarding the Elk City Entities, the Assets, or the Elk
City Business (the " _Elk City Confidential Information_ "), Buyer may
deliver written notice to Seller (i) describing in reasonable detail, with
supporting documentation and other data as Seller may reasonably request to
provide substantiation thereof, Buyers belief that Third Party Purchaser
is or may be violating its obligations to Seller under the Third Party
Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) requesting that Seller enforce its rights
under the Third Party Confidentiality Agreement to prohibit or restrain Third
Party Purchasers alleged violation thereof. Promptly following Sellers
receipt of any such written notice from Buyer, Seller agrees, at Buyers sole
expense, to take all reasonable measures to restrain Third Party Purchaser
from any prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or use of the Elk City
Confidential Information to the extent legally permissible under the terms of
the Third Party Confidentiality Agreement. Furthermore, Seller does hereby
covenant and agree that if it becomes aware that Third Party Purchaser is
violating any of its obligations under the Third Party Confidentiality
Agreement that relate in any way to any of the Elk City Confidential
Information, Seller shall promptly (A) notify Buyer of same, (B) enforce, on
behalf of Buyer, any and all rights and remedies that it may have against
Third Party Purchaser on account thereof, and (C) apprise Buyer of all
developments related thereto.

 

5.14 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Seller and its Affiliates shall take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that all Subject Employees are available for interviews by Buyer
a reasonable period of time prior to the Closing Date and employment by Buyer
on the Closing Date. Buyer and its Affiliates shall be under no obligation to
offer employment to any particular Subject Employee. Prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with an updated _Schedule 3.17(c)_ within 5
Business Days of the date upon which any change to the information contained
therein has occurred. On or before the Closing Date, Buyer or an Affiliate of
Buyer may offer employment to each Field Employee listed on _Schedule 3.17(c)_
and each Office Employee listed on _Schedule 3.17(c)_. Each such offer of
employment shall (A) be contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, (B) be
held open for not less than 10 Business Days after the respective offer is
made, (C) be made for a position (by function without regard to title)
substantially the same as the existing position held by such Subject Employee
and (D) be made at an annual salary or hourly wage rate that is not less than
the annual salary or hourly wage rate that the Subject Employee was receiving
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Buyer Employer_ " means the entity that makes such
employment offers and the term " _Transferred Employee_ " means each Subject
Employee who accepts such an offer of employment and becomes employed by Buyer
Employer in



 

40  accordance with such offer. Buyer shall promptly inform Seller in writing of
(x) the identity of each Subject Employee to whom Buyer Employer has made an
offer of employment and (y) the identity of each Transferred Employee. At the
time of Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause an Affiliate of Seller to,
terminate the employment with Seller and its Affiliates of all Transferred
Employees, and immediately upon Closing, the Transferred Employees shall
become employees of Buyer Employer.

(b) Buyer shall cause Buyer Employer to provide the Transferred Employees
with the same benefit plans and programs that are offered to similarly-
situated employees of Buyer or its applicable Affiliates. Buyer shall cause
each such benefit plan or program to honor, for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and benefits, the Transferred Employees service with Seller and its
ERISA Affiliates completed as of the Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that
such employees shall not receive such credit for purposes of benefit accrual
under any defined benefit retirement plan and such employees shall not receive
such credit for any purposes under any retiree medical programs of Buyer or
its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have no obligation
to cause the crediting of any service pursuant to this _Section 5.14(b)_ to
the extent that Seller does not, within 10 Business Days following the Closing
Date, furnish Buyer in writing information sufficient for Buyer to comply with
its obligations under this _Section 5.14(b)_.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither
Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller shall have any responsibility for, or any
Liability associated with or relating to, the compensation or employee
benefits provided to employees of Buyer Employer under Buyer Benefit
Plans (including any compensation or employee benefits that accrue on and
after the Closing with respect to Transferred Employees).

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to each Field Employee who does not receive an offer of employment from Buyer
or its Affiliate or whose offer of employment from Buyer or its Affiliate is
rescinded, in each case other than due to the Field Employees failure to meet
Buyers or its Affiliates standard drug testing and background check hiring
criteria (a " _Terminating Field Employee_ "), Buyer shall be obligated to and
shall, or shall cause Buyer Employer or an Affiliate of Buyer to, reimburse
and indemnify Seller and its Affiliates for, any costs set forth in _Schedule
5.14(d)_ (" _Termination Costs_ ") in accordance with the payment terms
described therein. If Buyer or its Affiliate terminates the employment of a
Transferred Employee without cause (as determined by Buyer or its Affiliate
in its reasonable discretion) during the 12-month period commencing on the
Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliate shall pay to the Transferred Employee (i)
a cash severance benefit equal to (A) the Transferred Employees (I) base
annual salary divided by 52 or (II) base hourly wage rate multiplied by 40,
multiplied by (B) the number of weeks specified in the severance formula in
_Schedule 5.14(d)_ , subject to the maximum number of weeks specified in
_Schedule 5.14(d)_ , plus (ii) a cash severance benefit equal to (A) the same
number of weeks determined in (i)(B) above multiplied by (B) the applicable
weekly COBRA premium cost for continued medical coverage for the Transferred
Employee and his or her dependents under the applicable Buyer Benefit Plan.
Seller, Buyer and Buyer Employer shall cooperate and use all commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
actions necessary to fulfill the obligations of Buyer, Buyer Employer and
Affiliates of Buyer under this _Section 5.14(d)_.



 

41 (e) The parties acknowledge that any requirements or obligations under
the WARN Act or any similar statute with respect to any event affecting the
Subject Employees occurring on or after the Closing are imposed upon and borne
solely by Buyer and not Seller. Accordingly, Buyer shall, and shall cause its
applicable Affiliates to, agree to provide any required notice under and to
otherwise comply with any requirements or obligations imposed by the WARN Act
or any similar statute with respect to any event affecting the Subject
Employees occurring on or after the Closing. Buyer shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and the Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to any Damages
under the WARN Act or similar statute arising from any event affecting the
Subject Employees that occurs on or after the Closing. 

(f) No provision of this _Section 5.14_ will create any third party
beneficiary rights in any person or organization (including without
limitation any current or former employees of Seller and its Affiliates or
Buyer and its Affiliates, or trustees, administrators, participants or
beneficiaries of any employee benefit plan) in respect of
continued employment (or resumed employment) of, or any benefits that may be
provided to any individual, directly or indirectly, under any employee
benefits plans and programs of Seller or its Affiliates or Buyer or its
Affiliates or any other matter. 

(g) Upon and following the Closing, Buyer will indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Damages
arising directly or indirectly from or in connection with or relating to
Buyers or its Affiliates offer of employment to, or hiring or employment by
Buyer or its Affiliates of, or termination from employment by Buyer or its
Affiliates of, any and all Transferred Employees.

(h) Seller agrees that pending the Closing it will not, and will cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit the employment of any
Subject Employees; and for a period of one year following the Closing, it will
not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit
the employment of any Transferred Employees (other than any Transferred
Employee who has been terminated, or had their offer of employment revoked, by
Buyer or its Affiliate); _provided_ , _however_ , that a general
advertisement or general solicitation for potential employees shall not be
considered a breach of this _Section 5.14(h)_, and a decision to hire a
Subject Employee or a Transferred Employee who applies in response to such
a solicitation shall not be considered a breach of this _Section 5.14(h)_.

(i) Seller shall take such actions as are necessary to permit Transferred
Employees to repay their loans outstanding under any Seller Benefit Plans on a
coupon basis or similar basis following Closing so that such loans will not
automatically default upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(j) Seller shall take such actions as are necessary to cause all Transferred
Employees to be paid their unpaid accrued vacation and other accrued paid time
off promptly following the Closing Date in accordance with Sellers normal pay
periods.

 



 

42 (k) Without in any way limiting the Sellers indemnification obligations
under _Section 7.3(a)(v)_, Buyer will, and will cause Buyer Employer and
Buyers Affiliates to (1) provide to Seller upon request by Seller any
documents then within the possession of Buyer, Buyer Employer or Buyers
Affiliates that were previously furnished to Buyer by Seller that may be
relevant to Employee Liabilities, and (2) use reasonable efforts to make
Transferred Employees then employed by it or an Affiliate of Buyer available,
as reasonably requested by Seller, on a basis that is convenient to Buyer,
Buyers Affiliates and Transferred Employees, to provide additional
information in the possession of Transferred Employees relating to Employee
Liabilities or to testify at proceedings relating to Employee Liabilities.
Seller agrees to and shall reimburse Buyer, Buyer Employer or any Buyer
Affiliates promptly upon request for all amounts paid and expenses incurred by
Buyer, Buyer Employer or any Buyer Affiliates as a result of such Persons
compliance with this _Section 5.14(k)_, and no Transferred Employee shall be
obligated to provide any information relating to an Employee Liability with
respect to which the Transferred Employee is a claimant. 

(l) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (other than
_Section 5.14(b)_ and  _Section 5.14(d)_), neither Buyer nor any Affiliate
of Buyer shall have any responsibility for, or any Liability associated with
or relating to, the compensation or employee benefits provided to employees of
Seller or its Affiliates under Seller Benefit Plans.

5.15 _No Solicitation; Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) At any time subsequent to the date hereof, and prior to the earlier to
occur of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, Seller and its Affiliates shall not, directly or indirectly,
through any officer, director, agent or employee of, or any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by,
Seller or any of its Affiliates solicit, initiate, seek or encourage
(including by way of furnishing information or assistance) or take other
action to facilitate any inquiries or the submission of any proposal
which constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal from any person other than Buyer. Seller shall notify Buyer if Seller
or any of its Affiliates has received a written Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) Upon execution by Seller of this Agreement, Seller and its Affiliates will
terminate any solicitations, encouragement, activities, discussions and
negotiations with any Person other than Buyer conducted heretofore by Seller
or its Affiliates with respect to any Acquisition Proposal until the earlier
of Closing or termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.1_.

5.16 _Release of Senior Secured Credit Facility, 2005 Indenture and 2008
Indenture._ On or before Closing, Seller shall (a) obtain a full release
effective as of the Closing Date releasing (i) all Liens encumbering or
affecting any of the Equity Interests or the Assets which are created under or
pursuant to or evidenced by the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the 2005



 

43  Indenture or the 2008 Indenture and (ii) each of the Elk City Entities from
all of their respective obligations (including, without limitation, any and
all guaranty obligations) under or pursuant to the Senior Secured Credit
Facility, the 2005 Indenture and the 2008 Indenture, (b) deliver to Buyer an
instrument substantially in the form attached to this Agreement as (i)
_Exhibit C_ duly executed by and acknowledged on behalf of Wachovia Bank,
N.A., as Administrative Agent to the lending parties to the Senior Secured
Credit Facility, evidencing such full release of all Liens and obligations
(including, without limitation, any and all guaranty obligations)
with respect to the Senior Secured Credit Facility effective as of the
Closing Date, (ii) _Exhibit D_ duly executed by and acknowledged on behalf of
U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, evidencing such full release of
the Elk City Entities obligations (including, without limitation, any and
all guaranty obligations) with respect to the 2005 Indenture effective as of
the Closing Date, and (iii) _Exhibit E_ duly executed by and acknowledged on
behalf of U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, evidencing such full
release of the Elk City Entities obligations (including, without limitation,
any and all guaranty obligations) with respect to the 2008 Indenture effective
as of the Closing Date. 

5.17 _Excluded Assets_. Prior to Closing, Seller shall cause the Elk City
Entities to divest or otherwise transfer all of the assets described on
_Schedule 5.17_ (the " _Excluded Assets_ ") to either Seller or one of
Sellers Affiliates (other than any of the Elk City Entities) without any
warranty (statutory, express or implied), indemnification or other residual
Liability of any kind whatsoever on the part of any of the Elk City Entities
and pursuant to an agreement that is reasonably acceptable to Buyer. For the
avoidance of doubt, none of the Excluded Assets shall be considered part of
the Assets or the Elk City Business at any time following the Closing.

_Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and all Damages arising,
directly or indirectly, from or in connection with any one or more of the
following: (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in
this Agreement or in any closing certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement; or (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be
performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

7.4 _Procedures_.

 

(a) If a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party that is entitled
to seek indemnification under  _Section 7.3_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ")
has a claim for indemnification under this _Article VII_ , other than a claim
for indemnification that involves a Third Party Claim, it shall give written
notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") to Seller or Buyer, as applicable (in each
case, the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), which notice shall describe in reasonable
detail to the extent then known the nature of such claim and the factual basis
and circumstances surrounding the same and set forth an estimate of the
amount of Damages attributable to such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall,
within 30 days after

 



 

47  its receipt of a Claim Notice, notify the Indemnified Party in writing as to
whether the Indemnifying Party admits or disputes the claim described in the
Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying Party gives written notice that it admits
the indemnification claim described in the Claim Notice, then the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article VII_ , and subject to the limitations hereof, with respect to the
estimated amount of Damages stated in the Claim Notice. If the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing that it disputes the claim for
indemnification, or that it admits the entitlement of the Indemnified Party
to indemnification under this _Article VII_ with respect thereto but disputes
the amount of the Damages in connection therewith, then in either of such
cases the indemnification claim described in the Claim Notice shall be
a disputed indemnification claim that must be resolved by settlement between
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party or by proceedings commenced
in an appropriate court of competent jurisdiction by either the Indemnifying
Party or the Indemnified Party or by any other mutually agreeable method.

(b) If an Indemnified Party receives notice of the assertion or commencement
of any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding made or brought by any Person
who or which is not a Party to this Agreement (a " _Third Party Claim_ ")
against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Person against whom
or which such indemnification is being sought is obligated to provide
indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party will give the
Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later
than 10 Business Days after receipt of such written notice of such Third
Party Claim (the " _Third Party Claim Notice_ "). Such notice by the
Indemnified Party will describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail,
will include copies of all available material written evidence thereof, and
will indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Damages
that have been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. Within 15 days
after receipt of the Third Party Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall
notify the Indemnified Party in writing that the Indemnifying Party either (i)
disputes the right of the Indemnified Party to indemnification under this
_Article VII_ with respect to the Third Party Claim or (ii) admits the right
of the Indemnified Party to indemnification under this _Article VII_ with
respect to Damages arising in connection with the Third Party Claim. The
failure of the Indemnifying Party to respond to the Indemnified Party within
such 15-day period after receipt of a Third Party Claim Notice shall be deemed
to constitute a response by the Indemnifying Party that it disputes the right
of such Indemnified Party to indemnification under this _Article VII_ with
respect to that Third Party Claim.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party admits in writing that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under this _Article VII_ with respect to a Third
Party Claim, then in such event (i) the Indemnifying Party shall diligently
defend the Third Party Claim with counsel approved by the Indemnified Party
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement of the
Third Party Claim unless such settlement is approved in writing by
the Indemnified Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided, however_ , that with respect to any claim
related to Taxes, such claim shall be defended by the applicable taxpayer
subject to the control of



 

48  the Indemnifying Party and the approval rights of clause (ii). The costs and
expenses of such defense shall be payable by the Indemnifying Party. If,
however, (i) the Indemnifying Party at any time fails to so conduct the
defense of the Third Party Claim or (ii) the Indemnified Party (A) determines
in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a proceeding may
adversely affect it other than as a result of monetary damages for which it
would be entitled to full indemnification under this Agreement or (B) upon
consultation with counsel has reasonably determined in its good faith judgment
that joint representation by counsel for the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party violates or would violate applicable ethical and
professional rules, then the Indemnified Party (upon notice to the
Indemnifying Party) may participate, together with counsel for the
Indemnifying Party, in the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third
Party Claims, and the reasonable costs and expenses of such participation
shall be payable by the Indemnifying Party.

 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party disputes the right of the Indemnified Party to
indemnification under this _Article VII_  with respect to the Third Party
Claim described in a Third Party Claim Notice, then in such event (i) the
Indemnified Party may defend the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice;
_provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party (x) shall diligently defend
such Third Party Claim and (y) may not enter into a settlement thereof without
obtaining approval of the Indemnifying Party (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless the Indemnified Party
will not be seeking indemnification for any amounts paid pursuant to such
settlement thereof or for any other consequences (except to the extent such
settlement would not prejudice the rights of the Indemnifying Party) and (ii)
the amount of Damages incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
such Third Party Claim shall be a disputed indemnification claim to be
resolved by settlement between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party or by proceedings commenced in an appropriate court of competent
jurisdiction by either the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party or by
any other mutually agreeable method.

 

(e) A failure to give timely notice or to include any specified information in
any notice as provided in  _Section 7.4(a)_ or _7.4(b)_ will not affect the
rights or obligations of any Party hereunder, except and only to the extent
that, as a result of such failure, any Party that was entitled to receive such
notice or information was deprived of its right to recover any payment under
its applicable insurance coverage or was otherwise prejudiced as a result of
such failure.

 

7.5 _Exclusive Remedy and Release_. Except as set forth in _Section 5.10_,
_Section 5.13_, and  _Section 8.17_ and for claims for fraud, the
indemnification and remedies set forth in this _Article VII_ shall, from and
after the Closing, constitute the sole and exclusive remedies of the Parties
with respect to any breach of representation or warranty or non-performance,
partial or total, of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement;
_provided, however_ , that nothing in this _Section 7.5_ shall prevent either
Party from seeking injunctive or equitable relief in pursuit of its
indemnification claims under this _Article VII_. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS
IDENTIFIED IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE, BUYER HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES, ACQUITS
AND FOREVER DISCHARGES SELLER AND ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS AND THEIR
RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS,



 

49  MANAGERS, MEMBERS, PARTNERS, STOCKHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS, OR ANY OTHER
PERSON ACTING ON BEHALF OF SELLER, OF AND FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, ACTIONS,
CAUSES OF ACTION, DEMANDS, RIGHTS, DAMAGES, COSTS, EXPENSES, LOSSES OR
COMPENSATION WHATSOEVER, WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN,
FORESEEN OR UNFORESEEN, WHICH BUYER NOW HAS OR MAY HAVE OR WHICH MAY ARISE IN
THE FUTURE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, INCLUDING ANY OF THE FOREGOING THAT IS
FROM OR RELATING TO THE POSSESSION, USE, HANDLING, MANAGEMENT, DISPOSAL,
INVESTIGATION, REMEDIATION, CLEANUP OR RELEASE OF ANY WASTES OR OTHER
SUBSTANCES GOVERNED BY ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR ANY ENVIRONMENTAL LAW
APPLICABLE THERETO.

ARTICLE VIII

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

8.1 _Termination of Agreement_. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be terminated at any time before the Closing as follows:

(a) by the mutual consent of Buyer and Seller as evidenced in writing signed
by each of Buyer and Seller;

(b) by Buyer, if there has been a material breach by Seller of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
that would give rise to the failure of a condition to the obligations of Buyer
at the Closing and, if such breach is of a character that it is capable of
being cured, such breach has not been cured by Seller within 30 days after
written notice thereof from Buyer, provided that Buyer is not in material
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement at such time;

(c) by Seller, if there has been a material breach by Buyer of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement that would give rise to the failure of a condition to the
obligations of Seller at the Closing and, if such breach is of a character
that it is capable of being cured, such breach has not been cured by Buyer
within 30 days after written notice thereof from Seller, provided that Seller
is not in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement at such time; and

(d) by either Buyer or Seller, if the transactions contemplated hereby have
not been consummated by the date that is six months following the date of
this Agreement unless the FTC or the DOJ issues a Second Request, in which
case Buyer or Seller may only terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(d)_ if the transactions contemplated hereby have not been
consummated by the date that is eight months following the date of this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that neither Buyer nor Seller will be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.1(d)_ if
such Persons breach of this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

50 8.2 _Effect of Termination and Actions for Monetary Damages_. If this
Agreement is terminated as provided in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and there shall be no Liability on the part of any Party
hereto with respect thereto; _provided, however_ , that nothing herein shall
relieve any Party from Liability for any material breach hereof by such Party
if this Agreement is terminated by the non-breaching Party under _Section
8.1(b)_ or _Section 8.1(c)_, as applicable.

 

8.3 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement shall provide
any benefit to any third party or entitle any third party to any claim, cause
of action, remedy or right of any kind, it being the intent of the Parties
that this Agreement shall not be construed as a third party beneficiary
contract; _provided, however_ , that the indemnification provisions in 
_Article VII_ shall inure to the benefit of Buyer Indemnified Parties and
Seller Indemnified Parties as provided herein ( _provided, however_ , that any
claim for indemnity hereunder on behalf of an Indemnified Party must be made
and administered by Seller or Buyer).

8.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each Party
hereto shall bear all of its legal, accounting and other costs and expenses
incident to the negotiation of this Agreement and the performance of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

part of the Agreement.

8.7 _Entire Agreement_. The Transaction Documents, the documents to

pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and
contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions,

hereof.

the obligations or other acts of any other Party or (b) waive compliance with

Seller, as applicable, the opportunity to review such press release or public
announcement.

 

8.11 _Assignment_. The provisions of this Agreement will be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns, but no Party may assign,



 

52  delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of each other Party to this
Agreement, except as otherwise contemplated in  _Section 5.8(f)_.

8.12 _Independent Covenants_. The covenants contained herein are independent

pursuant hereto and the legal relations between the Parties shall be governed
and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to principles of conflicts of law.

 

8.14 _Jurisdiction; Venue_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be brought in the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or any federal court of
competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware and each of the Parties
hereby consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate
appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party
agrees that service of process on such Party as provided in _Section 8.5_

AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT BE
LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES OR ANY PUNITIVE OR
EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING ANY BREACH OR ALLEGED BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY,
COVENANT OR AGREEMENT IN THIS AGREEMENT), WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARE BASED ON
BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY,
INCLUDING DIMINUTION OF VALUE OR DAMAGES DETERMINED AS A MULTIPLE OF INCOME;
_PROVIDED, HOWEVER_ , THAT THIS _SECTION 8.16_ SHALL NOT LIMIT A PARTYS RIGHT

REQUIRED TO PAY SUCH DAMAGES TO A THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH A MATTER FOR
WHICH SUCH PARTY IS OTHERWISE ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION HEREUNDER.

 



 

53 8.17 _Specific Enforcement_. The Parties acknowledge that, in view of the
uniqueness of the Elk City Business and the transactions contemplated hereby,
Buyer and Seller will not have an adequate remedy at Law for money damages and
will be irreparably damaged in the event that Closing fails to occur, or is
rendered incapable of occurring, as a result Sellers or Buyers, as the case
may be, breach of any term of this Agreement, and, therefore, the Parties
agree that Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall be entitled to specific
enforcement of the terms hereof to compel Seller or Buyer, as the case may
be, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 

8.18 _Further Assurances_. The Parties shall deliver any and all other
instruments or documents and take such other and further action as may be
reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to give effect to the terms and
provisions of this Agreement.

 

8.19 _Parent Guaranty_.

 

(a) Seller Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees all
obligations of Seller now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and the
Assignment, including _Article VII_ , and any and all expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by Buyer in enforcing any
rights under this Agreement (collectively, the " _Seller Obligations_ ").
Buyer Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees all obligations
of Buyer now or hereafter existing under this Agreement, including _Article
VII_ , and any and all expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred by Seller in enforcing any rights under this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Buyer Obligations_ ," and together with the Seller
Obligations, as applicable to each respective Party, the " _Obligations_ ").
For the purposes of this _Section 8.19_: (i) the term " _Guarantor_ " shall
refer to either Seller Parent or Buyer Parent, as applicable; (ii) the term "
_Obligor_ " shall refer to either Seller or Buyer, as applicable; and (iii)
the term " _Beneficiary_ " shall mean either Seller or Buyer, as applicable,
that is the intended beneficiary of the relevant parent guaranty.

 

(b) Guarantor guarantees that the Obligations will be performed strictly in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, regardless of any Law,
regulation or Order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting
any of such terms or the rights of Obligor with respect thereto. The liability
of Guarantor under this _Section 8.19_ shall be absolute and unconditional
irrespective of (i) any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any
provision of this Agreement or any other agreement or instrument relating
thereto, (ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in
any other term of, all or any of the Obligations, or any other amendment or
waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement, (iii) any release
or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guaranty, for
all or any of the Obligations; or (iv) any other circumstance which might
otherwise constitute a defense available to or a discharge of Obligor or
Guarantor.

 

(c) The guaranty set forth in this _Section 8.19_ shall continue to be
effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of
any of the Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by
Beneficiary upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Obligor or
otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. 



 

54  Guarantor hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any
other notice with respect to any of the Obligations and this guaranty.
Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any claims or other rights that it may
now or hereafter acquire against Beneficiary that arise from the existence,
payment, performance or enforcement of Guarantors respective obligations
under this guaranty or this Agreement, including, without limitation, any
right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or
indemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of
Beneficiary against Obligor, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises
in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without
limitation, the right to take or receive from the Obligor, directly or
indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner,
payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right. If any amount
shall be paid to Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence at any time
prior to the later of the cash payment in full of the Obligations and all
other amounts payable under this guaranty and the termination date, such
amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of Beneficiary, shall forthwith
be paid to Buyer to be credited and applied to the Obligations and all other
amounts payable under this guaranty, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and this guaranty, or to be held as collateral for any Obligations
or other amounts payable under this guaranty thereafter arising.

 

(d) The guaranty set forth in this _Section 8.19_ is a continuing guaranty
and shall (i) remain in full force and effect until 15 months following the
Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_;
_provided, however_ , that if Guarantor has been notified in writing of any
claims with regard to Obligations prior to such date, it shall remain in full
force and effect until discharge or payment in full of, or resolution of the
liability for, such Obligations, (ii) be binding upon Guarantor and its
respective successors and assigns, and (iii) inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by Beneficiary and its successors, transferees and assigns.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Guarantors aggregate liability under
this _Section 8.19_ shall not exceed the Final Purchase Price.

(f) Each Guarantor hereby makes the same representations set forth in 
_Sections 3.1_ , _3.3,_ and _3.4_ , modified only to reflect the relevant
entity type and formation jurisdiction of each such Guarantor. Except as
provided in this _Section 8.19_, the Guarantors are not making
any representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements under this
Agreement.

(g) Beneficiary agrees that Guarantor shall have no obligation under this
Agreement except for the guaranty set forth in this _Section 8.19_.
