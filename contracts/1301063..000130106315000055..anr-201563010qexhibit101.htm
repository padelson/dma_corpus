This Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (this "Agreement"), is dated as of

Delaware corporation ("Purchaser"). Seller and Purchaser are sometimes
referred to collectively as the "Parties" and individually as a "Party."

RECITALS

"Company"), which Units represent fifty percent (50%) of the issued and
outstanding membership interests of the Company;

WHEREAS, Purchaser owns the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the issued and
outstanding membership interests of the Company, represented by 1000 Units
held by Purchaser ("Purchaser's Original Interests"); and

WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell and Purchaser desires to purchase the
Interests, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual promises,
representations, warranties, covenants, conditions and agreements contained

Section 2.1 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Interests (the
"Purchase Price") shall be One Hundred Twenty-Seven Million Forty-Four
Thousand Four Hundred and Eighty-Six 0/100 Dollars ($127,044,486) (the
"Unadjusted Purchase Price"), which amount is inclusive of Seller's estimates
of Seller's indirect fifty percent (50%) share of (i) the Acquired Companies'
working capital, and (ii) all infrastructure costs incurred by or on behalf of
the Acquired Companies during Seller's ownership of the Interests, in each
case that have been calculated in accordance with the methodology set forth on
Schedule 2.1. The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted as provided in
Section 2.2. 

Section 2.2 Adjustments to Purchase Price. The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall
be adjusted as follows:

(a) Upward Adjustments. The Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward
by the following, without duplication:

(i) An amount equal to the aggregate amount of capital contributions, made in
accordance with the LLC Agreement and Contribution Agreement, made by Seller
or any of its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) to the Company or
any Subsidiary attributable to periods from and after the Effective Time and
on or prior to Closing;

(ii) An amount equal to the total estimated amount to be paid to Seller by the
Acquired Companies under the Seller Management Services Agreements for
services performed from the Effective Time through the Closing Date that are
not paid under such agreements;

(iii) An amount equal to all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the
Acquired Companies (or incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than
the Acquired Companies) for the account of the Acquired Companies) paid by
Seller attributable to periods after the Effective Time and on or prior to
Closing from Seller's or its Affiliates' (other than then Acquired Companies)
own funds, excluding amounts accounted for in Section 2.2(a)(i);

(iv) An amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of all 2015 Qualified Bonus
Amounts that are allocated and paid by Seller to non-executive employees
performing services to the Acquired Companies pursuant to the Bonus Program;

(v) An amount equal to the aggregate of all income, proceeds, receipts and
credits earned with respect to the Assets to which Seller is entitled under

Company or Purchaser and are (A) not recorded as an account receivable on the
books of the Acquired Companies as of the Effective Time; or (B) recorded as
an account receivable on the books of the Acquired Companies as of the
Effective Time, but the amount recorded is only an estimation or was not

(vi) Without duplication of Section 2.2(a)(v), any amount attributable to
under-estimates in working capital and/or infrastructure costs set forth on
Schedule 2.1 with respect to the Assets, as determined in a manner consistent
with the methodology set forth on Schedule 2.1; and

(vii) Any other amount agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser in writing prior to

downward by the following, without duplication:

(i) Any amount for unpaid Asset Taxes assessed for the current tax period
apportioned to Seller pursuant to Article VIII;

infrastructure costs set forth on Schedule 2.1 with respect to the Assets, as
determined in a manner consistent with the methodology set forth on Schedule
2.1;

(iii) The adjustment required under Section 3.2; and

(iv) Any other amount agreed upon by Seller and Purchaser.

Section 2.3 Allocation and Proration of Revenues and Expenses.

(a) Allocation of Production. For purposes of allocating production (and
accounts receivable with respect thereto), under Section 2.2 and Section
2.3(b), (i) liquid Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable
to" the Properties when they pass through the pipeline flange connecting into
the storage facilities located on the lands subject to the applicable Lease,
Well or Leasehold Unit or, if there are no such storage facilities, when they
pass through the LACT meters or similar meters at the point of entry into the
pipelines through which they are transported from those lands, and (ii)
gaseous Hydrocarbons shall be deemed to be "from or attributable to" the
Properties when they pass through the delivery point sales meters or similar
meters at the point of entry into the pipelines through which they are
transported from the lands subject to the applicable Lease, Well or Leasehold
Unit. Seller shall utilize reasonable interpolative procedures to arrive at an
allocation of production when exact meter readings (including gas production
meters or sales meters) or gauging and strapping data is not available.

(b) Entitlement to Production and Income. Except as accounted for in the
adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price, effective as of the Closing, all
production from or attributable to the Assets (and all products and proceeds
attributable thereto) and all other income, proceeds, receipts and credits
earned with respect to the Assets in each case from and after the Effective
Time be the sole property and entitlement of the Acquired Companies, and, to
the extent received by Seller after the Closing, Seller shall fully disclose,
account for and remit the same to the Acquired Companies within ten (10) days.
Effective as of the Closing, to the extent the following are held and retained
by any Acquired Company or Purchaser and are not recorded as an account
receivable on the books of the Acquired Companies as of the Effective Time,
fifty percent (50%) of all production from or attributable to the Assets (and
all products and proceeds attributable thereto) and fifty percent (50%) of all
other income, proceeds, receipts and credits earned with respect to the Assets
in each case before the Effective Time shall be the sole entitlement and
property of Seller and, to the extent received by or held by Purchaser or any
Acquired Company after Closing, Purchaser shall (or shall cause any Acquired
Company to) fully disclose, account for and remit the same to Seller within
ten (10) days.



Section 2.4 Allocation of Purchase Price. Seller and Purchaser agree that for
Tax purposes, the Unadjusted Purchase Price and any other amounts treated as
consideration paid by Purchaser for Tax purposes shall be allocated among the
Assets, consistent with the allocated values set forth on Schedule 2.4 (the
"Purchase Price Allocation"; with respect to each Asset, as applicable, the
"Allocated Value"). The Purchase Price Allocation shall be prepared in
accordance with the principals set forth in Section 1060 and 338 of the Code.

desired access to and sufficiently reviewed the Records relating to the
Acquired Companies' title to the Assets, and to any other title records
relating to the Assets (collectively, the "Title Information"). Purchaser
acknowledges and represents that it has made all such independent reviews and
inspections of the Title Information as it has deemed necessary or desirable
in making the decision to enter into this Agreement, each document and

Seller makes no representation, warranty or covenant relating to the title to
the Assets, including any failure of title, defect in title, or other lien,
encumbrance, covenant, obligation, or deficiency affecting title, and
acknowledges and agrees that it has not relied upon any such representations,
warranties, or covenants of Seller, or other statements of Seller or any
member of the Seller Group (whether contained herein or made outside this
Agreement). Except for (i) the adjustment provided in this Section 3.2, and
(ii) the warranty in Section 4.20 and the rights and remedies in Article IX,
nothing in this Agreement (or in any document or instrument delivered in
connection herewith) shall be construed as containing such a representation,
warranty or covenant.

date hereof, Purchaser acknowledges and represents that it has received all
requested access to the Properties and Assets (including visual inspections
and interviews), and to the Records relating to Environmental Laws,
liabilities under Environmental Laws, the environmental condition of the
assets, or other environmental matters. Purchaser's review was conducted at
its sole cost, risk and expense, and Purchaser acknowledges and represents
that, except for the representation in Section 4.16, it has relied solely upon
its own investigation with respect to the foregoing environmental matters in
making the decision to enter into this Agreement, each document and instrument
to be executed pursuant hereto, and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. Purchaser represents that it and its
Affiliates and/or consultants have abided by the safety rules, regulations,
and operating policies of Seller, any Acquired Company or any Third Party
operator while conducting its due diligence evaluation of the Interests and
Assets. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representation
in Section 4.16, Seller makes no representation, warranty or covenant relating
to the presence of absence of liabilities under Environmental Laws, compliance
with Environmental Laws, the release of materials into the environment, the
protection of the environment or health or the environmental condition of the
Assets, and acknowledges and agrees that it has not relied upon any such
representations, warranties, or covenants or Seller, or other statements of
Seller or any member of the Seller Group. Except for the representation in
Section 4.16, nothing in Article III or elsewhere in this Agreement (or in any
document or instrument delivered in connection herewith) shall be construed as
containing such a representation, warranty or covenant.

associated with the exploration, development and operation of the Assets and

have come in contact with the soil.

(vi) Special procedures may be required for the remediation, removal,

Section 3.5 Consents to Assignment and Preferential Rights to Purchase. With
respect to any Required Consents or any preferential rights to purchase any
Asset or similar preferential rights held by a Third Party (excluding the
Acquired Companies) that would be triggered by the purchase and sale of the
Interests contemplated by this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate
to promptly prepare and send notices to the relevant Third Parties (excluding
Required Consents customarily obtained after Closing) to request the
applicable Required Consents or waivers of preferential rights to this
transaction. Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate and use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such applicable Required Consents and waivers of
preferential rights (or the exercise thereof) to be obtained and delivered
prior to Closing, provided Seller shall not be obligated to make any payment
or provide other consideration to (or for the behalf of) the holders of such
Required Consents or preferential rights to obtain and/or waive them. Except
as provided in the preceding sentence, Seller shall have no liability for the
failure to obtain such Required Consents or waivers. To the extent a Required
Consent is not obtained prior to Closing, Seller shall reasonably cooperate
with Purchaser in attempts to obtain such Required Consents for a period of
sixty (60) days after the Closing. If the waiver of any such preferential
purchase right is not obtained prior to Closing, then the provisions of

the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA and which is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
or favorable opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary is aware of any circumstances likely to result in
revocation of any such favorable determination letter. Seller has properly
classified all of its employees who have provided services for the Acquired
Companies as its common law employees for all purposes, including under each
employee benefit plan sponsored, maintained, contributed to or required to be
contributed to by the Seller or its Affiliates ("Seller Benefit Plans").

Section 4.3 The Subsidiaries.

(a) Existence and Qualification. Each Subsidiary is a limited liability
company duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of its respective
jurisdiction of formation as described in Exhibit B and is duly qualified to
do business as a foreign limited liability company in each jurisdiction where
its assets are located, except where the failure to so qualify would not,
individually or in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Power. Each Subsidiary has the limited liability company power and
authority to own, lease or otherwise hold its assets and conduct its business
in the manner consistent with recent practice.

(c) No Conflicts. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.10, the consummation of
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall not (i) violate any
provision of the certificate of formation or the limited liability company
agreement (or equivalent certificates and governing instruments) of any
Subsidiary, (ii) result in default (with due notice or lapse of time or both)
or the creation of any lien or encumbrance or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration under any material note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, or other financing instrument to which any Subsidiary is
a party or by which it is bound, (iii) violate any judgment, order, ruling, or
decree applicable to any Subsidiary as a party in interest, or (iv) violate
any Laws applicable to the Subsidiary, or any of its Assets, except any
matters described in clauses (ii), (iii), or (iv) above which would not have a
Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that with respect to Clause (ii)
for any Loan documents, guarantees or Hedges to which any Acquired Company is
a party the above representations and warranties shall only be true as of the
Closing Date.



(d) Certificate of Formation and Limited Liability Company Agreement. Seller
has delivered to Purchaser true and complete copies of the certificates of
formation and the limited liability company agreements, each as amended to
date, of each Subsidiary.

(e) Title to Equity Interests of the Subsidiaries. The issued and outstanding
membership interests in each Subsidiary are owned of record as described in
Exhibit B. In the case of such issued and outstanding membership interests
owned of record by the Company or any Subsidiary as shown on Exhibit B (the
"Equity Interests"), such interests or interest are also owned beneficially
and free and clear of any liens, claims, encumbrances, security interests,
options, charges and restrictions of any kind other than restrictions on
transfers that may be imposed by applicable federal or state securities laws,
or in the applicable Subsidiary's limited liability company agreement, similar
governing instruments or the LLC Agreement. Other than this Agreement and, in
the case of Subsidiaries, their respective limited liability company
agreements, similar governing instruments or the LLC Agreement, the Equity
Interests are not subject to any voting agreement or other contract,
agreement, arrangement, commitment or understanding, including any such
agreement, arrangement, commitment or understanding restricting or otherwise
relating to the voting, dividend rights or disposition of the Equity
Interests.

(f) The Equity Interests. The entire equity ownership of each Subsidiary
consists of the membership interests as set forth in Exhibit B attached
hereto. In each case, all the Equity Interests are duly authorized and validly
issued and outstanding, fully paid, non-assessable (except as expressly
authorized by the terms of the applicable operating agreements or limited
liability company agreements of the Subsidiaries and except as such
nonassessability may be affected by Section 18-607 of the Delaware Limited
Liability Company Act) and have not been issued in violation of any preemptive
rights. Except for the membership interests shown on Exhibit B, there are no
outstanding interests, units or other equity interests in any Subsidiary, or
any contractual arrangements giving any Person a right to receive any benefits
or rights similar to the rights enjoyed by or accruing to the holders of any
Equity Interests of any Subsidiary. Other than pursuant to this Agreement, the
limited liability company agreements of the Subsidiaries or similar governing
instruments, or the LLC Agreement, there are no outstanding warrants, options,
rights, convertible or exchangeable securities or other commitments pursuant
to which the Company or any Subsidiary is or may become obligated to issue or
sell any capital stock or other equity interests in such Subsidiary.

exclusive of Income Taxes (collectively, the "Asset Taxes") that have become
due and payable during the Seller Ownership Period, and all Tax Returns with
respect to such Taxes have been duly and timely filed. The Company has not
elected to be treated as a corporation for any Tax purpose, and each
Subsidiary is treated as an entity disregarded as a separate entity from its
owner for federal Income Tax purposes;

(b) the Company and the Subsidiaries have paid all Taxes (other than Asset

such Taxes have been duly and timely filed;

Knowledge, there is no uncured violation of any Laws applicable to the

development or operation of the Assets or would reasonably be expected to
result in any common law or other Claims. Seller and the Acquired Companies
have all material permits, licenses and other governmental authorizations
(collectively the "Permits") necessary to own, use, enjoy, lease or otherwise

Seller or any of its Affiliates has received written notice of any violation
of any such Permit that remains uncured.

outstanding, and no currently effective notices have been received by Seller,
the Company or any Subsidiary of the exercise of any premature termination,
price redetermination, market-out or curtailment of any Material Contracts. To
Seller's knowledge, no event or circumstance has occurred that, with notice or
lapse of time or both, would constitute an event of default under any Material
Contract or result in a termination thereof or would cause or permit the
acceleration or other changes of any material right or obligation or the loss
of material any benefit thereunder. To Seller's knowledge, complete and
correct copies of each Material Contract (including all modifications,
amendments and supplements thereto and waivers thereunder) have been made
available to Purchaser prior to the date hereof. There are no material

Section 6.3 Intercompany Accounts. Except to the extent accounted for in the
adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price, as of the Closing, all unsettled
intercompany accounts between the Company or any Subsidiary, on the one hand,
and Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Company and
Subsidiaries) on the other hand (the "Intercompany Accounts"), are settled in
accordance with the terms of the JV Agreements and any applicable Contracts
and Surface Rights, including through the payment by the Acquired Companies to
Seller of all amounts due and payable to Seller under the Seller Management
Services Agreements and the payment by Seller of all amounts due and payable
to the Acquired Company under the applicable Seller Management Services
Agreement(s).

Section 6.4 Further Assurances. After Closing, Seller and Purchaser each agree
to take such further actions and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all such
further documents as are reasonably requested by the other for carrying out
the purposes of this Agreement or of any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement.

Section 6.5 JV Employees.

(a) Certain employees of Seller that are primarily dedicated to providing
services to the Acquired Companies and that are eligible to be hired by
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.5 are set forth on Schedule 6.5
("Qualified JV Employees"). From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser may
interview Qualified JV Employees during normal business hours, provided that
all contact and communication shall be coordinated through Seller's designated
human resources personnel. At its sole discretion, Purchaser may make offers
of employment to Qualified JV Employees, provided no employment by Purchaser
may be effective prior to August 1, 2015, or other date mutually agreed by the
Parties. Seller shall retain responsibility for the payment of any employee
benefits or entitlement, including severance pay, accrued vacation, sick or
holiday pay, to any Qualified JV Employee or any other employee of Seller
pursuant to any Seller Benefit Plans as a result of or in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Purchaser covenants and agrees to comply with all applicable Laws with
respect to the hiring of any of Seller's employees, including Laws concerning
anti-discrimination in employment and federal and state background checking
laws. Purchaser shall indemnify, reimburse, defend and hold harmless the
Seller Group from and against any and all Damages based upon, arising out of
or otherwise in respect of any employment



action or practice of Purchaser, the Acquired Companies or any of Purchaser's
Affiliates after Closing in connection with Persons employed by or seeking to
be employed by Purchaser, the Acquired Companies or any of Purchaser's
Affiliates, including claims, suits, actions or proceedings relating to or
arising under the WARN Act. This indemnity shall survive Closing in accordance
with Article IX.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall: (i) obligate
the Purchaser to assume, continue, or maintain any Seller Benefit Plan; (ii)
no liabilities of the Seller Benefits Plans shall be transferred to, or
assumed by, the Company, the Purchaser, the Employee Benefit Plans or the
Purchaser's employee benefit plans; (iii) the Seller and its affiliates shall
be solely responsible for funding and/or paying any benefits under any of the
Seller Benefit Plans, including any termination benefits and other employee
entitlements accrued under such plans by or attributable to employees or
former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (iv) confer upon any
employee of Seller or its affiliates, or any representative of any such
employee, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or
continued employment for any period or terms of employment, of any nature
whatsoever, or (v) be interpreted to prevent or restrict the Purchaser or its
affiliates from modifying or terminating the employment or terms of employment
of any Qualified JV Employees, including the amendment or termination of any
employee benefit or compensation plan, program or arrangement, after the
Closing Date.

Section 6.6 Other Preferential Rights. If a Third Party holds a preferential
right to purchase any portion of an Asset that is triggered by the purchase
and sale of the Interests contemplated by this Agreement, and such Person
fails to exercise said right prior to Closing, and the time for exercise or
waiver has not yet expired, the following procedures shall be applicable. If
one or more of the holders of any such preferential right to purchase notifies
Seller or any of the Acquired Companies subsequent to the Closing that it
intends to assert its preferential purchase right, the Acquired Companies
shall (and Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Companies to) satisfy all such
preferential purchase right obligations to such holders and shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Seller Group from and against any and all Damages in
connection therewith and the Acquired Companies shall be entitled to retain
all proceeds received from such holders in connection with such preferential
rights to purchase. This indemnity shall survive Closing in accordance with
Article IX.

Section 6.7 Non-Compete.

(a) Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates (excluding the Acquired
Companies) to not, directly or indirectly, acquire in any capacity during the
period from and after Closing and ending on the fifth anniversary of the
Effective Time, any interest in any Restricted Opportunity, whether alone or
as a partner, joint venturer, or lender to any other Person acquiring such
interest.

(b) As used herein "Restricted Opportunity" means any opportunity for,
including an opportunity to finance, the leasing, acquisition, farm-in,
exploration, development, production, transportation, gathering or marketing
or any combination of the foregoing, of Hydrocarbons produced from or that may
be produced from or attributable to



lands lying within the Project Area. In the event Seller acquires an interest
in derogation of this Section, Purchaser shall have the option to require
Seller to automatically assign such interest to Purchaser or its designee
without any remuneration on behalf of Purchaser.

(c) The Parties agree that the limitations contained in this Section 6.7 with
respect to time, geographical area and scope of activity are reasonable.
However, if any court shall determine that the time, geographical area or
scope of activity of any restriction contained in this Section 6.7 is
unenforceable, it is the intention of the Parties that such restrictive
covenant set forth herein shall not thereby be terminated but shall be deemed
amended to the extent required to render it valid and enforceable.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 6.7 to the contrary, this
Section 6.7 shall not apply to, limit or restrict in any way, any direct or
indirect investment made by Seller Group (i) in any debt or equity securities
of any Person (including without limitation any options, warrants or
derivatives relating thereto) listed on a national securities exchange or
actively trading in the public over-the-counter market or otherwise offered to
the public in compliance with federal or state securities laws to the extent
such investment constitutes a passive investment, or (ii) in any non-
convertible debt (including without limitation any options, warrants or
derivatives relating thereto) of any person listed on a national securities
exchange, or actively traded in the public over-the-counter market; provided,
that such Restricted Opportunity was not acquired by the grantor in violation
of this Section 6.7.

Section 7.4 Closing Payment and Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustments.

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller delivered to Purchaser, using and based
upon actual amounts then available (or if actual amounts are not available,
Seller's reasonable best estimate of the actual amounts), a preliminary
settlement statement estimating the Purchase Price for the Interests after
setting forth each adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price set forth in
Section 2.2. Purchaser and Seller agree that the estimates delivered in
accordance with this Section 7.4(a) constitute the collective dollar amount to
be payable by Purchaser to Seller at the Closing (the "Closing Payment").

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing but not later than
one-hundred and twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement setting forth the final
calculation of the Purchase Price and showing the calculation of each
adjustment, based, to the extent possible on actual credits, charges, receipts
and other items before and after the Effective Time and taking into account
all adjustments provided for in this Agreement. Seller shall supply reasonable
documentation available to support any credit, charge, receipt or other item.
As soon as reasonably practicable but not later than the 30th day following
receipt of Seller's statement hereunder, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a
written report containing any changes that Purchaser proposes be made to such
statement. Purchaser may not later contest or submit to the Independent Expert
any amounts or adjustments that were not contested in Purchaser's written
report, which amounts or adjustments Purchaser will be deemed to have
accepted. If Purchaser does not timely deliver such written report within such
30-day period, Purchaser shall be deemed to agree with the adjustments set
forth in Seller's statement. The Parties shall undertake to agree on the final
statement of the Purchase Price no later than one hundred and fifty (150) days
after the Closing Date (such final statement, the "Final Settlement
Statement"). In the event that the Parties cannot agree on the final Purchase
Price within one hundred and fifty (150) days after the Closing Date, the
specific disputed items will be automatically referred to an independent
expert of the Parties' choosing with at least ten (10) years of oil and gas
accounting experience for arbitration (the "Independent Expert"). If the
Parties are unable to agree upon an Independent Expert, then such Independent
Expert shall be selected by any Federal District Court or State District Court
Judge in Houston, Texas. The Independent Expert shall conduct the arbitration
proceedings in English in Houston, Texas in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, including
procedures to expedite such arbitration proceedings, to the extent such rules
do not conflict with the terms of this Section. The Independent Expert's
determination shall be made within thirty (30) days after submission of the
matters in dispute (or as soon as possible thereafter) and shall be final and
binding on both Parties, without right of appeal. In determining the proper
amount of any adjustment to the Purchase Price, the Independent Expert shall
not increase the Purchase Price more than the increase proposed by Seller nor
decrease the Purchase Price more than the decrease proposed by Purchaser, as
applicable. The Independent Expert shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed matters submitted by either Party
and may not award damages or penalties to either Party with respect to any
matter. Each Party shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case. Seller shall bear one-half of the



costs and expenses of the Independent Expert and the Purchaser shall bear one-
half of such costs and expenses. Within five (5) Business Days after the date
on which the Parties agree (or are deemed to agree) on the Final Settlement
Statement or the Independent Expert finally determines the disputed matters,
as applicable, (i) Purchaser shall pay to Seller the amount by which the
Purchase Price exceeds the Closing Payment, or (ii) Seller shall pay to
Purchaser the amount by which the Closing Payment exceeds the Purchase Price,
as applicable.

(c) All payments made or to be made under this Agreement to Seller shall be
made by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to Seller to such
bank and account as may be specified by Seller in writing, for the credit of
Seller. All payments made or to be made hereunder to Purchaser shall be by
electronic transfer or immediately available funds to a bank and account
specified by Purchaser in writing to Seller, for the credit of Purchaser.

ARTICLE VIII 
TAX MATTERS

Section 8.1 Apportionment of Asset Taxes. The payment to the appropriate
Governmental Authority of all Asset Taxes, and the filing of all Tax Returns
or reports in respect of such Asset Taxes, shall be handled or made by the
Acquired Companies in accordance with applicable Law. Purchaser shall be
responsible for all Asset Taxes for any period that begins on or after the
Effective Time. If such Asset Taxes are assessed for any period that includes
the Effective Time, they shall be apportioned (1) between the portion of the
period occurring prior to the Effective Time and the portion of the period
occurring after the Effective Time based on the number of days in the
applicable period falling before the Effective Time and on the number of days
in the applicable period falling on or after the Effective Time, (2) with
respect to the portion of the period occurring after the Effective Time, 100%
to Purchaser, and (3) with respect to the portion of the period occurring
prior to the Effective Time, fifty percent (50%) to Purchaser and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and fifty percent (50%) to Seller, on the other
hand; provided that production, severance, excise and similar Taxes shall be
apportioned based on the number of units actually produced, purchased or sold
or proceeds of sale, as applicable, before, or at and after, the Effective
Time. For purposes of this Section 8.1, ad valorem and real property Taxes
assessed for a particular time period shall be deemed attributable to such
time period, even if such assessment is valued based (in whole or in part)
upon production or other data for prior Tax periods. The actual amounts
associated with the above, if any, shall be accounted for to the extent known
in the adjustments to the Purchase Price at Closing and finally reconciled in
the Final Settlement Statement based on then-current information.

Section 8.2 Refunds. Purchaser agrees to pay to Seller fifty percent (50%) of
any refund received (whether by payment, credit, offset or otherwise, and
together with any interest thereon) after the Closing by Purchaser or its
Affiliates, including the Company and Subsidiaries, in respect of any Asset
Taxes assessed for any period prior to the Effective Time. With respect to a
refund for any Asset Tax period that includes the Effective Time, such refund
shall be apportioned (1) between the portion of such period prior to the
Effective Time, and the portion of such period after the Effective Time, in
the same manner as Asset Taxes assessed for a period in Section 8.1,



and (2) with respect to the portion of the refund apportioned to the period
prior to the Effective Time, fifty percent (50%) to Purchaser and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and fifty percent (50%) to Seller, on the other
hand. Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller and Seller's Affiliates in order
to take all necessary steps to claim any such refund. Any such refund received
by Purchaser or its Affiliates or the Company or Subsidiaries shall be paid to
Seller within thirty (30) days after such refund is received. Purchaser agrees
to notify Seller within ten (10) days following the discovery of a right to
claim any such refund and upon receipt of any such refund. Purchaser agrees to
claim any such refund as soon as possible after the discovery of a right to
claim a refund and to furnish to Seller all information, records and
assistance necessary to verify the amount of the refund or overpayment.

Section 8.3 Amendment of Tax Returns. Except to the extent required by
applicable Laws, after Closing Purchaser shall not and shall not permit its
Affiliates, including the Company and Subsidiaries, to amend any Tax Return
with respect to a taxable period for which Seller may be liable for Taxes.

ARTICLE IX 
INDEMNIFICATION; LIMITATIONS

Section 9.1 Indemnification.

severally, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller Group from and
against all Damages incurred or suffered by Seller Group:

(i) caused by, arising out of or resulting from (x) the ownership, use or
operation of the Assets, or (y) the ownership, management or operation of the

EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER
SOLE, SIMPLE, JOINT, CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER
LEGAL FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON, or a pre-existing condition. As used
herein, "Seller Group" means, collectively, Seller, its Affiliates, and its
and their respective officers, managers, directors, employees, attorneys,
agents, partners, representatives, members, shareholders, successors, assigns
and insurers of Seller or such Affiliates.



(b) Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Purchaser Group
against and from all Damages incurred or suffered by Purchaser Group:

Seller's covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or

(ii) caused by or arising out of or resulting from any breach of any
representation or warranty made by Seller contained in Article IV.

EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER
SOLE, SIMPLE, JOINT, CONCURRENT, ACTIVE OR PASSIVE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER
LEGAL FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON, OR A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. As used
herein, the "Purchaser Group" means, collectively, Purchaser, its Affiliates,
and its and their respective officers, managers, directors, employees,

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, from
and after Closing, except for the rights of the Parties under Article VI,
Seller's and Purchaser's exclusive remedy against each other with respect to
(i) breaches of the representations and warranties herein (excluding the
Fundamental Representations with respect to breaches of which the Parties
shall also have whatever rights and remedies are available to them at law or
in equity), and (ii) the ownership, operation, condition, quality or value of
the Assets, including the environmental condition, in all cases is limited to
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Section 9.1 and if no such
right to indemnification is expressly provided, then such claims and other
remedies available at Law or in equity (including rights to contribution under
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of
1980, as amended, and under other Environmental Laws, breaches of statutory or
implied warranties, nuisance or other tort actions, rights to punitive damages
and common law rights of contribution) are hereby irrevocably released and
waived by the Parties on behalf of themselves and their Indemnified Persons,
EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR
CONCURRENT, BUT EXCLUDING GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT), OF ANY
RELEASED PERSON, OR A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION, excluding, however, any existing
contractual rights (subject to the Termination Agreement) between (i)
Purchaser or any of Purchaser's Affiliates and (ii) Seller or any of Seller's
Affiliates under contracts between them relating to the Assets or Interests,
other than this Agreement.

(d) "Damages" shall mean the amount of any actual liability, loss, cost,
expense, fine, penalty, claim, damage, settlement, award or judgment, whether
attributable to personal injury or death, property damage, contract claims,
torts or otherwise, including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys,
consultants, accountants or other agents and experts reasonably incident to
matters indemnified against, and the costs of investigation and/or monitoring
of such matters, and the costs of enforcement of the indemnity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Damages shall not include, loss of profits,
whether actual or consequential,



and all other consequential, indirect, and special damages except to the
extent such losses and damages are payable to a Third Party pursuant to a
Claim.

(e) Any claim for indemnity under Article VIII or this Section 9.1 by any
Person in Seller Group must be brought and administered by Seller or by any
Person in Purchaser Group must be brought and administered by Purchaser. No
Indemnified Person other than Seller and Purchaser shall have any rights
against either Seller or Purchaser under the terms of Article VIII or this
Section 9.1 except as may be exercised on its behalf by Purchaser or Seller,
as applicable, pursuant to this Section 9.1(e). Each of Seller and Purchaser
may elect to exercise or not exercise indemnification rights under this
Section on behalf of the other Indemnified Persons affiliated with it in its
sole discretion and shall have no liability to any such other Indemnified
Person for any action or inaction under this Section.

(f) Without prejudice to those Sections, this Section 9.1 shall not apply in
respect of matters related to Asset Taxes other than Section 4.5, which are
exclusively covered by Article II and Article VIII. The Parties shall treat,
for Tax purposes, any amounts paid under this Article IX as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price in the same manner as provided in Section 2.2.

Section 9.2 Indemnification Actions. All claims for indemnification under
Section 9.1 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) For purposes of this Article IX, the term "Indemnifying Person" when used
in connection with particular Damages shall mean the Person having an
obligation to indemnify another Person or Persons with respect to such Damages
pursuant to this Article IX, and the term "Indemnified Person" when used in
connection with particular Damages shall mean a Person having the right to be
indemnified with respect to such Damages pursuant to this Article IX (solely
including, for the avoidance of doubt, any member of Purchaser Group or Seller
Group, as applicable).

(b) To make a claim for indemnification under Section 9.1, an Indemnified
Person shall notify the Indemnifying Person of its claim, including the
specific details of and specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the
"Claim Notice"). In the event that the claim for indemnification is based upon
a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified Person (a "Claim"), the
Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim Notice not later than ten (10) days
after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the Claim and shall
enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Claim. In the
event that the claim for indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach
of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall
specify the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was
inaccurate or breached.

(c) In the case of a claim for indemnification based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether it admits or denies its
obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Claim under this
Article IX. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the Indemnified Person
within such thirty (30) day period regarding whether the



Indemnifying Person admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified
Person, it shall be deemed to have denied its obligation to defend the
Indemnified Person against such Claim under this Article IX. The Indemnified
Person is authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day period, to file
any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or
appropriate to protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Person and
that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Person.

(d) If the Indemnifying Person admits its obligation, it shall have the right
and obligation to defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Claim. The
Indemnifying Person shall have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof. If requested by the
Indemnifying Person, the Indemnified Person agrees to cooperate in contesting
any Claim which the Indemnifying Person elects to contest (provided, however,
that the Indemnified Person shall not be required to bring any counterclaim or
cross-complaint against any Person). The Indemnified Person may at its sole
cost which shall not be covered by this indemnity, participate in, but not
control, any defense or settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying
Person pursuant to this Section 9.2(d); provided, that the Indemnified Person
may file initial pleadings as described in the last sentence of paragraph (c)
above if required by court or procedural rules to do so within the thirty (30)
day period in paragraph (c) above. An Indemnifying Person shall not, without
the written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any Claim or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect thereto that (i) does not result in a
final resolution of the Indemnified Person's liability with respect to the
Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional written
release of the Indemnified Person from all further liability in respect of
such Claim) or (ii) may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Person
(other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

(e) If the Indemnifying Person does not admit its obligation or admits its
obligation but fails to diligently defend or settle the Claim, then the
Indemnified Person shall have the right to defend against the Claim (at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnified Person is
entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of the Indemnified
Person's choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to admit
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person and assume the defense of
the Claim at any time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If
the Indemnifying Person has not yet admitted its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Person, the Indemnified Person shall send written notice to the
Indemnifying Person of any proposed settlement but the Indemnified Person
shall not settle, compromise, admit or make any acknowledgement that would
give rise to liability on the part of any Indemnifying Person without the
prior written consent of such Indemnifying Person. If the Indemnified Person
settles any Claim over the objection of the Indemnifying Person whether before
or after the Indemnifying Person has timely admitted its obligation for
indemnification in writing and assumed the defense of the Claim, the
Indemnified Person shall be deemed to have waived any right to indemnity with
respect to the Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnifying
Person has denied (or is deemed to have denied) its obligation to defend the
Indemnified Person against such Claim under this Article IX, such Indemnifying
Person shall nonetheless be entitled to participate at its own expense in the
defense of the Claim,



and the Indemnified Person shall provide to the Indemnifying Person access to
all pleadings and discovery relating to such Claim.

(f) In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii) admit its obligation to
provide indemnification with respect to such Damages or (iii) dispute the
claim for such Damages. If the Indemnifying Person does not notify the
Indemnified Person within such thirty (30) day period that it has cured the
Damages or that it disputes the claim for such Damages, the Indemnifying
Person shall be deemed to dispute the claim for such Damages.

Section 9.3 Limitation on Actions.

(a) All representations and warranties of Seller in Article IV and Purchaser
in Article V shall survive until the day that is one (1) year counted from and
after the Closing Date and expire thereafter; provided, however, that the
Fundamental Representations shall survive until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations period. The covenants and other agreements
of Seller and Purchaser set forth in this Agreement shall survive the Closing
until fully performed in accordance with their terms and expire thereafter.
Representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall terminate and be
of no further force and effect after the respective date of their expiration,
after which time no claim may be asserted thereunder by any Person, provided
that there shall be no termination of any bona fide claim asserted pursuant to
this Agreement with respect to such a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement prior to its expiration or termination date. The remainder of this
Agreement shall survive the Closing without time limit except as may otherwise
be expressly provided herein.

(b) The indemnities in Sections 9.1(a)(ii), 9.1(a)(iii), 9.1(b)(i) and
9.1(b)(ii) shall terminate with respect to a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement as of the termination date of such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that is subject to indemnification, except in
each case as to matters for which a specific written claim for indemnity has
been delivered to the Indemnifying Person on or before such termination date.
The indemnities in Section 9.1(a)(i), and all disclaimers, express
acknowledgements, waivers and releases herein, continue without time limit.

(c) The indemnity obligations under Section 9.1(b)(ii), as applicable, except
the Fundamental Representations, shall apply as follows:

(i) Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Person under Section
9.1(b)(ii) for any individual liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award or
judgment that does not exceed Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000) in the
aggregate, and such individual Damages may not be applied towards the
Indemnity Deductible;

(ii) Seller shall not have any liability for indemnification under Section
9.1(b)(ii) until and unless the aggregate amount of the liability for all
Damages for which Claim Notices are timely delivered by Purchaser exceeds a



deductible amount equal to one and a half percent (1.5%) of the Purchase Price
(the "Indemnity Deductible"), after which point Purchaser or Purchaser
Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to claim Damages in excess of the
Indemnity Deductible; and

(iii) Seller shall not be required to indemnify Purchaser under Section
9.1(b)(ii) for aggregate Damages in excess of fifteen percent (15%) of the
Purchase Price.

(d) The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnity under Article IX shall be reduced by the amount of insurance
