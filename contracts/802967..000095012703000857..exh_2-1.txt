Statement, or (B) to notify Purchaser of any dispute by Sellers' Representative,

notice  shall set forth in  reasonable  detail  the basis for such  dispute.  If
Sellers'  Representative  shall so notify  Purchaser of  acceptance  by Sellers'
Representative, on behalf of Sellers, of the Closing Adjustment Amount Statement
within such  thirty-calendar day period, the Closing Adjustment Amount Statement
shall constitute the "Final Closing Adjustment Amount Statement" and the date of
delivery of such notice shall  constitute the "Final  Purchase Price  Adjustment
Date". If Sellers'  Representative  shall fail either so to notify  Purchaser of
acceptance  by Sellers'  Representative,  on behalf of  Sellers,  of the Closing
Adjustment  Amount  Statement  or so to notify  Purchaser of any such dispute by

Sellers'  Representative's  delivery  of the notice of such  dispute as provided

accordance with

                                                                            -20-
<PAGE>

such resolution of such dispute,  shall constitute the "Final Closing Adjustment
Amount Statement."

               (iii) In the event that  Purchaser  and  Sellers'  Representative
shall be unable to resolve any such  dispute  described  in Section  2.09(b)(ii)
within the Resolution Period, then such dispute shall be submitted to a big four
independent  accounting firm (the "Price Adjustment  Auditor")  selected by both
parties  within ten (10)  calendar days after the  expiration of the  Resolution
Period (such submission to the Price Adjustment Auditor being referred to herein
as the "Price Adjustment Audit").  If Purchaser and Sellers'  Representative are
unable to agree on the Price  Adjustment  Auditor,  then  Purchaser and Sellers'
Representative  shall each have the right to request  the  American  Arbitration
Association  to appoint the Price  Adjustment  Auditor,  which Price  Adjustment
Auditor  shall not have had a material  relationship  with  Purchaser,  Sellers'
Representative,  Gentek  Holdings  or any of its  Subsidiaries,  OTPPB or any of
their respective  affiliates within the immediately  preceding two (2) years. In
connection   with  the  Price   Adjustment   Audit,   Purchaser   and   Sellers'
Representative  shall execute,  if requested by the Price Adjustment  Auditor, a
reasonable  engagement  letter.  All fees and  expenses  incurred  by the  Price
Adjustment  Auditor in connection with the Price Adjustment Audit shall be borne
equally by Purchaser and Sellers, in the aggregate. The Price Adjustment Auditor
shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator  to  determine,  based solely on
presentations by Purchaser and Sellers'  Representative,  and not by independent
review,  only those issues in dispute between the parties  regarding the Closing
Adjustment Amount Statement.  The Price Adjustment Auditor's determination shall
be requested to be made within twenty (20) calendar days of its selection, shall
be set forth in a written  statement (the "Auditor's  Determination  Statement")
delivered to Purchaser and Sellers'  Representative and shall be final,  binding
and  conclusive  on  Purchaser,  Sellers'  Representative  and Sellers and shall
constitute an arbitral  award upon which a judgment may be entered by a court of
competent jurisdiction.  The Closing Adjustment Amount Statement, as modified by
the Auditor's  Determination  Statement,  shall  constitute  the "Final  Closing
Adjustment  Amount  Statement"  and  the  date  of  delivery  of  the  Auditor's
Determination  Statement shall  constitute the "Final Purchase Price  Adjustment
Date."

               (iv) The  Purchase  Price shall be subject to a final  adjustment
(the "Final Purchase Price Adjustment") following the Closing as follows:

                    (1)  In  the   event   that  (A)   Fifty   Million   Dollars
($50,000,000)  exceeds  Working  Capital,  as set  forth  in the  Final  Closing
Adjustment Amount Statement, then Sellers shall pay to Purchaser an amount equal
to such excess, if any, less any amounts  previously paid to Purchaser  pursuant
to Section  2.09(a)(iii),  and (B)  Working  Capital,  as set forth in the Final
Closing  Adjustment  Amount  Statement,   exceeds  Forty  Five  Million  Dollars
($45,000,000),  then  Purchaser  shall pay to  Sellers  an amount  equal to such
excess,  less  any  amounts  previously  paid to  Sellers  pursuant  to  Section
2.09(a)(iii);  provided,  however,  that in no event shall the aggregate  amount
released  and/or  paid to  Sellers  pursuant  to Section  2.09(a)(iii)  and this
Section 2.09(a)(iv)(1) exceed Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000).

                                                                            -21-
<PAGE>

                    (2) In the event that (A) Closing Net  Indebtedness,  as set
forth in the  Final  Closing  Adjustment  Amount  Statement,  exceeds  Estimated
Closing  Net  Indebtedness,  as set  forth in the  Estimated  Adjustment  Amount
Statement,  Sellers  shall pay to Purchaser  the amount of such  excess,  or (B)
Estimated  Closing Net  Indebtedness,  as set forth in the Estimated  Adjustment
Amount Statement,  exceeds Closing Net  Indebtedness,  as set forth in the Final
Closing  Adjustment Amount  Statement,  Purchaser shall pay to Sellers an amount
equal to such excess.

               (v) Any amounts payable by Purchaser or Sellers,  as the case may
be, pursuant to Section  2.09(b)(iv)  shall be set-off against any obligation to
make a payment  by the other  party or  parties,  if any,  pursuant  to  Section
2.09(b)(iv).  Within  five (5)  business  days  after the Final  Purchase  Price
Adjustment  Date,  Purchaser or Sellers,  as applicable,  shall pay to the other
party or parties, as the case may be, by wire transfer in immediately  available
funds to an account designated in writing by the receiving party within four (4)
business  days of the Final  Purchase  Price  Adjustment  Date,  any net  amount
payable to the receiving party pursuant to Section 2.09(b)(iv).  Any net amounts
payable by Sellers  pursuant to Section  2.09(b)(iv)  shall be paid first out of
the  funds  then  held  in the  Purchase  Price  Escrow  and  second  out of the
Indemnification Escrow. Any net amounts payable by Purchaser pursuant to Section
2.09(b)(iv) shall be paid first out of the funds then held in the Purchase Price
Escrow.  Within one (1) business day after the Final Purchase  Price  Adjustment
Date, Purchaser and Sellers' Representative, on behalf of Sellers, shall deliver
to the Escrow Agent irrevocable  instructions to release funds from the Purchase
Price  Escrow  and,  if  required  pursuant  to  this  Section  2.09(b)(v),  the
Indemnification  Escrow  to make  the  payments  contemplated  by  this  Section
2.09(b)(v).   Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  set  forth  in  this

the existence of any contractual obligations, or any other matters in respect of
the  past  or  present  business  or  operations  of  Gentek  Holdings  and  its
Subsidiaries or any of their  predecessors) that would reasonably be expected to
give rise to any  Liability  that has a Material  Adverse  Effect.  All material
environmental  audits and reports  relevant to the Owned Real  Property  and the
Leased  Real  Property  in  the  possession  of  Gentek  Holdings  or any of its
Subsidiaries have been made available to Purchaser.

     Section  4.12.  Intellectual  Property.  Section  4.12  of  the  Disclosure
Schedule  contains  a  complete  and  accurate  list  of  each  current  item of
Registered  IP Rights and each and every  license  or  agreement,  which  grants
rights under Owned Intellectual  Property,  or Licensed  Intellectual  Property.
Sellers'  Representative  has, or has caused to be, made  available to Purchaser
copies of all material  licenses or material  sublicenses  relating to the Owned
Intellectual  Property or  Licensed  Intellectual  Property.  Each item of Owned
Intellectual  Property  is owned  free and  clear  of all  Encumbrances,  except
Permitted Encumbrances, and each item of Licensed Intellectual Property licensed
to Gentek  Holdings or any of its  Subsidiaries  is licensed  under a subsisting
license  or  sublicense  which  is to  knowledge  of  Gentek  Holdings  and  its
Subsidiaries  valid and in full force and effect and  enforceable  in accordance
with its terms and the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  will not
breach or  violate  the terms  thereof.  None of Gentek  Holdings  or any of its
Subsidiaries  is in  material  breach or  default of any  license or  sublicense
listed in Section 4.12 of the  Disclosure  Schedule.  To the knowledge of Gentek
Holdings  and its  Subsidiaries,  except  as set  forth on  Section  4.12 of the
Disclosure Schedule,  the Owned Intellectual  Property and Licensed Intellectual
Property  include all IP Rights used and  material to Gentek  Holdings or any of
its Subsidiaries to conduct their  respective  Businesses as and where conducted
on the Closing Date and as contemplated to be conducted in the near term. To the
knowledge  of  Gentek  Holdings  and  its  Subsidiaries,  none  of the  business
operations of Gentek  Holdings or any of its  Subsidiaries  (including,  without
limitation,  the  manufacturing,  marketing  licensing,  sale or distribution of
products and the general  conduct and  operation of their  businesses)  violate,
infringe  or  misappropriate  any IP  Rights of any  Person.  Each item of Owned
Intellectual  Property listed on Section 4.12 of the Disclosure Schedule,  shown
as registered,  filed, issued or applied for, has been duly filed in, registered
in, issued by or applied for with, the official  governmental  registrars and/or
issuers (or officially recognized issuers) of patents, trademarks, copyrights or
Internet domain names (as applicable), in the various jurisdictions indicated on
such item, and except as set forth on Section 4.12 of the  Disclosure  Schedule,
each such  registration,  filing,  issuance and/or  application (i) has not been
abandoned or canceled,

                                                                            -32-
<PAGE>

(ii) has been  maintained  effective  by all  requisite  filings,  renewals  and
payments, and (iii) to the knowledge of Gentek and its Subsidiaries,  remains in
full force and  effect as of the  Closing  Date.  Except as set forth in Section
4.12  of  the  Disclosure  Schedule,  none  of  Gentek  Holdings  or  any of its
Subsidiaries  has (1) received any notice of any claim,  or a written  threat of
any claim,  from any third party  within the past two years,  and no third party
claims are pending,  alleging an infringement,  violation or misappropriation of
any intellectual  property  rights,  and (2) nor have any of them made any claim
against any third party of a violation,  or  misappropriation or infringement of
Owned Intellectual Property which claim is pending.  Gentek Holdings and each of
its Subsidiaries has internal policies and taken steps reasonably  sufficient to
protect and preserve  the  confidentiality  of those Trade  Secrets it wishes to
maintain as confidential.

     Section 4.13. Real Property.

          (a) Section  4.13(a) of the  Disclosure  Schedule  lists and notes the
address,  including  the name of the record or  registered  title  owner of each
parcel of Real  Property and the address and landlord and tenant for each Leased
Real Property.  Gentek Holdings or its Subsidiaries are the legal and beneficial
owners of and have good and valid title in fee simple to the Owned Real Property
and Gentek Holdings or its Subsidiaries have valid leasehold  interests that are
in full force and effect in the Leased Real Property.  Each parcel of Owned Real
Property  is owned  free and clear of all  Encumbrances  (other  than  Permitted
Encumbrances)  and each parcel of Leased Real  Property is leased  under a valid
and subsisting lease, sublease,  offer to lease or agreement to lease. Purchaser
has been provided or afforded  access to copies of each Real  Property  Document
and all written  amendments  thereto  relating to the Real  Property.  Each Real
Property  Document  relating  to the Leased  Real  Property is in full force and
effect,  and none of Gentek  Holdings  or any of its  Subsidiaries  or any other
party  thereto is in default in any  material  respect  under any Real  Property
Document.

          (b) There is no pending or, to the knowledge of Gentek Holdings or any
of  its  Subsidiaries,   threatened  condemnation,  eminent  domain  or  similar
proceeding with respect to, any Real Property.

     Section 4.14.  Assets.  Gentek Holdings and each of its Subsidiaries  owns,
leases or has the  exclusive  legal right to use all of the material  properties
and  assets  (other  than IP  Rights)  used in their  respective  conduct of the
Business and, with respect to contract rights, are, as the case may be, party to
and enjoy the right to the benefits of all material  contracts,  agreements  and
other  arrangements  used in or  relating  to their  respective  conduct  of the
Business (all such properties, assets and rights being referred to herein as the
"Assets").  Gentek Holdings and its Subsidiaries  have good and marketable title
to,  or,  in the case of  leased  or  subleased  Assets,  valid  and  subsisting
leasehold  interests in, all of the Assets,  free and clear of all Encumbrances,
except Permitted Encumbrances.

                                                                            -33-

     Section 4.15. Employee Benefit Matters.

          (a) Section 4.15(a) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and
accurate list of all "employee  benefit plans" within the meaning of ss. 3(3) of
ERISA,   all  bonus,   stock  option,   stock  purchase,   incentive,   deferred
compensation,  supplemental  retirement,  severance and other  employee  benefit
plans,  programs and arrangements,  and all employment agreements (except to the
extent an employment  agreement  provides for "at-will"  employment and does not
provide for  severance  payments),  in each case for the benefit of, or relating
to, current  employees  and/or former employees of Gentek Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries  and any such plans,  programs and  arrangements  of any person (as
defined in ss. 3(9) of ERISA) which together with Gentek  Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries would be deemed to be a "single employer" within the meaning of ss.
414 of the Code (any such  Person,  an "ERISA  Affiliate"),  but  excluding  any
Canadian  Employee Plan as defined in Section 4.15(n)  (collectively,  the "U.S.
Employee Plans"). All U.S. Employee Plans are in compliance in all respects with
the  requirements  prescribed by applicable Law currently in effect with respect
thereto, and Gentek Holdings and its Subsidiaries have performed all obligations
required to be  performed  by any of them  under,  and are not in any respect in
default under or in violation of, any of the U.S.  Employee Plans, in each case,
except as would not  reasonably  be expected to result in material  liability to
Gentek Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries.  Each U.S. Employee Plan intended to
be  qualified  under ss.  401(a) of the Code and each trust  intended to qualify
under ss. 501(a) of the Code has either  applied for, prior to the expiration of
the   requisite   period   under   applicable   Treasury   Regulations   or  IRS
pronouncements,  or obtained a  favorable  determination  notification  advisory
and/or opinion letter, as applicable, as to its qualified status from the IRS or
still has a remaining  period of time under applicable  Treasury  Regulations or
IRS  pronouncements in which to apply for such letter and to make any amendments
necessary  to  obtain a  favorable  determination.  To the  knowledge  of Gentek
Holdings and its  Subsidiaries,  nothing has occurred since the date of the most
recent  determination  that could  reasonably be expected to cause any such U.S.
Employee  Plan or trust to fail to  qualify  under  ss.  401(a) or 501(a) of the
Code.  Purchaser has been provided or afforded  access to copies of (i) all U.S.
Employee Plans and, where applicable, summary plan descriptions and summaries of
material  modifications with respect to the U.S. Employee Plans, (ii) the annual
report on IRS Form 5500-Series,  including any attachments thereto, for the 2000
and 2001 plan years,  and (iii) all minutes  with respect to the meetings of the
benefit committees of the U.S. Employee Plans since January 1, 2000.

          (b) No complete or partial termination of any U.S. Employee Plan which
is subject to Title IV of ERISA has  occurred or is  expected to occur,  and, to
the knowledge of Gentek Holdings and its Subsidiaries,  no proceedings have been
instituted  and no  condition  exists  and no  event  has  occurred  that  could
constitute  grounds under Title IV of ERISA to terminate or appoint a trustee to
administer any U.S.  Employee Plan. No U.S.  Employee Plan subject to ss. 412 or
418B of the Code or ss.  302 of  ERISA  has  incurred  any  accumulated  funding
deficiency  within  the  meaning  of ss.  412 or 418B of the Code or ss.  302 of
ERISA,  respectively,  or has applied for or obtained a waiver from the Internal
Revenue Service of any minimum funding requirement or an

                                                                            -34-

extension of any amortization period under ss. 412 of the Code or ss. 303 or 304
of ERISA.  Except for  payments  of premiums  to the  Pension  Benefit  Guaranty
Corporation (the "PBGC"), which have been paid in full, none of Gentek Holdings,
any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability in the
past six years  (including any indirect,  contingent or secondary  liability) to
the PBGC in connection with any U.S. Employee Plan covering any active,  retired
or former employees or directors of Gentek Holdings or any of its  Subsidiaries,
including,  without limitation, any liability under ss. 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA
or any penalty  imposed  under ss. 4071 of ERISA,  or ceased  operations  at any
facility or withdrawn  from any such U.S.  Employee Plan in a manner which could
subject it to liability  under ss. 4062,  4063 or 4064 of ERISA, or knows of any
facts or circumstances  that might give rise to any material liability of Gentek
Holdings, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate to the PBGC under Title
IV of ERISA that could  reasonably be  anticipated to result in any claims being
made against the Purchaser by the PBGC.


          (c) None of  Gentek  Holdings,  any of its  Subsidiaries  or any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred any  withdrawal  liability  (including  any contingent or
secondary withdrawal  liability) within the meaning of ss. 4201 or 4204 of ERISA
to any U.S.  Employee  Plan  which is a  "multiemployer  plan"  (as such term is
defined  in  ss.  4001(a)(3)  of  ERISA)  ("Multiemployer  Plan"),  and,  to the
knowledge of Gentek Holdings and its Subsidiaries,  no event has occurred and no
conditions  or  circumstance  has existed,  that presents a material risk of the
occurrence of any withdrawal from or the partition, termination,  reorganization
or insolvency of any such  Multiemployer Plan which could result in any material
liability of Gentek Holdings,  any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate to
any such  Multiemployer  Plan.  Except as set forth on  Section  4.15(c)  of the
Disclosure  Schedule,  none of Gentek  Holdings,  any of its Subsidiaries or any
ERISA  Affiliate  has,  within  the past  six  years,  maintained,  established,
sponsored,  participated in, contributed to, or had any obligation to contribute
to any Multiemployer Plan.

          (d) Neither Gentek Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries  maintains any
U.S.  Employee  Plan which is a "group  health plan" (as such term is defined in
ss.  5000(b)(1)  of the  Code  or  ss.  607(1)  of  ERISA)  that  has  not  been
administered  and operated in all  respects in  compliance  with the  applicable
requirements  of Part 6 of  Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and ss.  4980B of the
Code and neither Gentek  Holdings nor any of its  Subsidiaries is subject to any
liability,  including,  without  limitation,  additional  contributions,  fines,
taxes, penalties or loss of tax deduction as a result of such administration and
operation,  to the extent any such  failures  would  reasonably  be  expected to
result,  individually or in the aggregate,  in any material  liability to Gentek
Holdings and its  Subsidiaries.  No U.S.  Employee  Plan,  which is such a group
health plan, is a "multiple employer welfare arrangement," within the meaning of
ss. 3(40) of ERISA.

          (e) Neither Gentek Holdings nor any of its Subsidiaries  maintains any
U.S. Employee Plan (whether  qualified or non-qualified  under ss. 401(a) of the
Code) providing for  post-employment  or retiree health,  life insurance  and/or
other  welfare  benefits  and  having  unfunded  liabilities,  except  as may be
required by COBRA

                                                                            -35-
<PAGE>

or other  applicable  similar  statute.  Neither Gentek  Holdings nor any of its
Subsidiaries  has any unfunded  liabilities  pursuant to any U.S.  Employee Plan
that is a pension  plan  (within  the  meaning of ss.  3(2) of ERISA) and is not
intended to be qualified under ss. 401(a) of the Code.

          (f) Neither Gentek Holdings nor any of its  Subsidiaries  has incurred
any material liability for any tax or excise tax arising under Chapter 43 of the
Code and no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of Gentek  Holdings and its
Subsidiaries,  no condition or circumstance  has existed that could give rise to
any such liability.

          (g) No asset of Gentek Holdings or any of its  Subsidiaries is subject
to any lien arising under ss. 302(f) of ERISA or ss. 412(n) of the Code,  and no
event  has  occurred  and no  condition  or  circumstance  has  existed  that is
reasonably likely to give rise to any such lien. Neither Gentek Holdings nor any
of its  Subsidiaries  has been required to provide any security under ss. 307 of
ERISA or ss.  401(a)(29) or 412(f) of the Code, and no event has occurred and no
condition or circumstance has existed that is reasonably  likely to give rise to
any such requirement to provide any such security.

          (h) There are no actions,  suits,  claims or disputes pending,  or, to
the knowledge of Gentek Holdings and its  Subsidiaries,  threatened with respect
to any U.S.  Employee  Plan or the assets of any such plan (other  than  routine
claims for benefits and appeals of denied routine claims).  No civil or criminal
action  brought  pursuant to the  provisions  of Title I,  Subtitle B, Part 5 of
ERISA is pending or, to the knowledge of Gentek  Holdings and its  Subsidiaries,
threatened,  anticipated or expected to be asserted  against Gentek  Holdings or
any of its  Subsidiaries  or,  to the  knowledge  of  Gentek  Holdings  and  its
Subsidiaries,  any fiduciary of any U.S. Employee Plan, in any case with respect
to any U.S.  Employee Plan. No U.S.  Employee Plan has been, within the past six
years,  the direct  subject of an audit,  investigation  or  examination  by any
governmental or  quasi-governmental  agency that would reasonably be expected to
result in material liability to Gentek Holdings and its Subsidiaries.

          (i) Full payment has been made of all amounts which Gentek Holdings or
any of its  Subsidiaries  is required,  under  applicable  law or under any U.S.
Employee  Plan or any  agreement  relating  to any U.S.  Employee  Plan to which
Gentek  Holdings  or any  of its  Subsidiaries  is a  party,  to  have  paid  as
contributions  or premiums  thereto as of the last day of the most recent fiscal
year of such  U.S.  Employee  Plan  ended  prior  to the date  hereof.  All such
contributions to any U.S.  Employee Plan have been fully deducted for income tax
purposes and, to the knowledge of Gentek Holdings and its Subsidiaries,  no such
deduction  has been  challenged or  disallowed  by any  Governmental  Authority,
except as would not  reasonably  be expected to result in material  liability to
Gentek  Holdings and its  Subsidiaries.  Benefits under all U.S.  Employee Plans
are, in all material  respects,  as represented in the documents which have been
provided or made available to Purchaser and have not been  increased  subsequent
to the date as of which  documents  have  been  provided  or made  available  to
Purchaser.

                                                                            -36-
<PAGE>

          (j) As of  January  1,  2003,  the  value of the  accumulated  benefit
obligations  (based  upon  actuarial  assumptions  which  are in  the  aggregate
reasonable  and which  have been  furnished  to the  Purchaser)  under each U.S.
Employee  Plan  which is  covered  by Title IV of ERISA  and  which is a "single
employer plan" (as such term is defined in ss.  4001(a)(15)  of ERISA)  ("Single
Employer Plan") did not exceed the current fair value of the assets of each such
Single Employer Plan allocable to such accrued benefits, and since the Reference
Balance  Sheet  Date,  there  has been (i) no  material  adverse  change  in the
financial condition of any Single Employer Plan, (ii) no change in the actuarial
assumptions  with respect to any Single  Employer  Plan and (iii) no increase in
benefits under any Single Employer Plan as a result of plan amendments,  written
interpretations or announcements  (whether written or not) which individually or
in the  aggregate,  would  result in the  current  value of any Single  Employer
Plan's accrued benefits  exceeding the current value of all such Single Employer
Plan's  assets.  No U.S.  Employee  Plan holds as an asset any  interest  in any
annuity  contract,  guaranteed  investment  contract or any other  investment or
insurance contract, policy or instrument issued by an insurance company that, to
the  knowledge  of Gentek  Holdings  and its  Subsidiaries,  is the  subject  of
bankruptcy, conservatorship,  insolvency, liquidation, rehabilitation or similar
proceedings.

          (k) No  "reportable  event" (as such term is  defined  in ss.  4043 of
ERISA) for which the thirty-day  notice  requirement  has not been waived by the
PBGC has occurred  within the past six years or is reasonably  expected to occur
with respect to any U.S.  Employee Plan.  Neither Gentek Holdings nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective directors,  officers,  employees or, to
the best knowledge and belief of Sellers,  Gentek Holdings and its Subsidiaries,
other  persons who  participate  in the  operation of any U.S.  Employee Plan or
related trust or funding vehicle, has engaged in any transaction with respect to
any U.S. Employee Plan or breached any applicable fiduciary  responsibilities or
obligations  under  Title I of ERISA  that would  subject  any of them to a tax,
penalty or liability for prohibited  transactions  or breach of any  obligations
under ERISA or the Code that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be  expected  to  result  in  material  liability  to  Gentek  Holdings  and its
Subsidiaries.

          (l) The  execution  of this  Agreement  and  the  consummation  of the
transactions  contemplated hereby do not constitute a triggering event under any
U.S.  Employee Plan which (either alone or upon the occurrence of termination of
employment in connection  therewith) will or may result in any payment  (whether
of severance pay or otherwise),  "parachute payment" (as such term is defined in
ss.  280G of the Code),  acceleration,  vesting or  increase  in benefits to any
employee  or  former  employee  or  director  of Gentek  Holdings  or any of its
Subsidiaries.  No U.S.  Employee  Plan  provides  for the payment of  severance,
termination, change in control or similar-type payments or benefits.

          (m) The Options  constitute  all of the  outstanding  stock options to
purchase Shares heretofore  granted under any stock option plan,  whether or not
vested or exercisable.

                                                                            -37-

          (n) Section 4.15(n) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and
accurate list of all material bonus,  stock option,  stock purchase,  incentive,
pay equity, deferred compensation,  pension, supplemental retirement,  severance
and other employee  benefit plans,  programs or  arrangements,  and all material
employment agreements (except to the extent an employment agreement provides for
"at-will" employment and does not provide for severance payments),  in each case
for the benefit of, or relating to,  current  employees and former  employees of
Gentek  Canada  (collectively,  the  "Canadian  Employee  Plans").  All Canadian
Employee Plans are in compliance in all material  respects with the requirements
prescribed  by  applicable  Law  currently in effect with respect  thereto,  and
Gentek Canada (and any relevant  pension  committee)  has performed all material
obligations  required to be  performed  by it under,  and is not in any material
respect in default under or in violation of, the Canadian  Employee Plans.  Each
Canadian  Employee  Plan  intended  to be  registered  under the  Income Tax Act
(Canada)  has  been  so  registered  thereunder  and the  applicable  provincial
legislation,  and, to the  knowledge of Gentek  Holdings  and its  Subsidiaries,
nothing has occurred that could  reasonably be expected to adversely  affect the
tax-exempt  status of such Canadian  Employee Plans or the funds held thereunder
or subject such funds to any tax or penalty that would reasonably be expected to
result in material liability to Gentek Holdings and its Subsidiaries. There have
been no  withdrawals  or transfers of assets from any  Canadian  Employee  Plan,
including,  without limitation,  the taking of any contribution holidays, except
in accordance with the terms of such Canadian Employee Plans and applicable Law,
except as would not  reasonably  be expected to result in material  liability to
Gentek  Holdings  or any of its  Subsidiaries.  Purchaser  has been  provided or
afforded access to copies of all Canadian  Employee Plans and, where applicable,
summary plan descriptions as filed with Governmental Authorities.

          (o) No termination or windup of any of the Canadian Employee Plans has
occurred or is expected to occur,  and no proceedings  have been instituted and,
to the knowledge of Gentek Holdings and its  Subsidiaries,  no condition  exists
and no event has occurred that could constitute grounds under applicable Laws to
terminate or windup or appoint a trustee to  administer  any  Canadian  Employee
Plan.

          (p)  Gentek  Canada  does not  maintain  any  Canadian  Employee  Plan
providing for  post-employment  or retiree health,  life insurance  and/or other
welfare benefits and having unfunded  liabilities,  except as may be required by
statute.

          (q) There are no actions,  suits,  claims or disputes pending,  or, to
the knowledge of Gentek Holdings and its  Subsidiaries,  threatened with respect
to any Canadian Employee Plan or the assets of any such plan (other than routine
claims for benefits and appeals of denied routine claims).  No Canadian Employee
Plan has been,  within  the past six  years,  the  direct  subject  of an audit,
investigation  or examination by any governmental or  quasi-governmental  agency
that would  reasonably  be expected to result in  material  liability  to Gentek
Holdings and its Subsidiaries.

          (r) Full payment has been made of all amounts  which Gentek  Canada is
required,  under  applicable  Laws or under any  Canadian  Employee  Plan or

                                                                            -38-

any agreement relating to any Canadian Employee Plan to which Gentek Canada is a
party, to have paid as  contributions  or premiums thereto as of the last day of
the most recent  fiscal year of such  Canadian  Employee Plan ended prior to the
date hereof.

          (s) As of the  date  of  this  Agreement,  the  current  value  of the
accumulated benefit  obligations (based upon actuarial  assumptions which are in
the aggregate  reasonable and which have been furnished to the Purchaser)  under
each Canadian Employee Plan which is substantially  similar to a Single Employer
Plan did not exceed the current  fair value of the assets of each such  Canadian
Employee  Plan  allocable  to such  accrued  benefits,  and since the  Reference
Balance  Sheet  Date,  there  has been (i) no  material  adverse  change  in the
financial  condition of any such Canadian  Employee Plan,  (ii) no change in the
actuarial assumptions with respect to any such Canadian Employee Plan, and (iii)
no increase in benefits  under any such  Canadian  Employee  Plan as a result of
plan  amendments,  interpretations  or  announcements  (whether written or not),
which individually or in the aggregate, would result in the current value of any
Canadian  Employee  Plan's accrued  benefits  exceeding the current value of all
such Canadian Employee Plan's assets.

Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate only in respect of that portion of the
Proprietary   Information   (as  defined  in  the   Confidentiality   Agreement)
exclusively relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If this
Agreement   is,  for  any  reason,   terminated   prior  to  the  Closing,   the
Confidentiality  Agreement  shall  continue  in full  force and effect and shall
terminate in accordance with its terms.

          (b) For a period of three (3) years  following the Closing Date,  each

affiliates,  agents  or  representatives  are  requested  or  required  (by oral
question,  interrogatory,  request for information or documents, subpoena, civil
investigative   demand  or  similar   process)  to  disclose  any   Confidential
Information prior to the Closing, Sellers' Representative shall notify Purchaser
of such  request or  requirement  and shall  cooperate  with  Purchaser  so that
Purchaser may seek an appropriate  protective order or other appropriate remedy.
If such  protective  order or remedy is not  obtained,  any  Seller or  Sellers'
Representative,  as the case may be,  may  disclose  only  that  portion  of the
Confidential  Information to the Person compelling  disclosure as is required by
applicable Law or judicial process.

          (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section
6.03, except as may be prohibited by applicable  securities Laws, the parties to

obtain,  prior to the Closing,  the ISRA  Approvals,  and (ii) each party hereto
shall make an  appropriate  filing,  if necessary,  pursuant to the HSR Act, the
Competition Act and the Investment  Canada Act with respect to the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement  promptly after the date hereof and shall supply,
as promptly as practicable, to the

                                                                            -50-

other third party consents as Purchaser may reasonably request to consummate the

reasonable  efforts to assist Gentek Holdings and its  Subsidiaries in obtaining

(financial or otherwise) to any third party in connection with such  cooperation
or efforts.

          (b) At all times  during the period  commencing  with the  Closing and
expiring on the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, Gentek Holdings and
its  Subsidiaries   (and  any  successor(s)   thereto)  shall  use  commercially

each  case,  without  the  necessity  of a  subpoena,  and (ii)  furnishing  the
Sherwin-Williams Claims Trust with such access to employees,  witnesses,  files,
books and records of Gentek Holdings and its  Subsidiaries,  as the case may be,
as the  Sherwin-Williams  Claims  Trust  may  reasonably  request  in  order  to

otherwise  pursue the  Sherwin-Williams  Claims,  in each case,  upon reasonable

consent of the Sherwin-Williams  Claims Trust. Without Purchaser's prior consent
(which  consent  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or  delayed),  neither the
Sherwin-Williams Claims Trust nor any other Person with control over the Pending
Sherwin-Williams  Litigation  and  the  Sherwin-Williams  Claims  following  the
Closing shall (i) settle or otherwise  compromise  the Pending  Sherwin-Williams
Litigation  or the  Sherwin-Williams  Claims or (ii)  liquidate,  distribute  or
otherwise transfer any property held in the Sherwin-Williams Claims Trust (other
than  the  reasonable  fees  of  the  Trustee)   unless,   prior  thereto,   the
Sherwin-Williams  Claims Trust or such other Person,  as the case may be, either
(x) receives an unconditional discharge or release by Sherwin-Williams of Gentek
Holdings  and  its  Subsidiaries  from  Sherwin-Williams  with  respect  to  any
counter-claims made in the Pending Sherwin-Williams Litigation or arising out of
the pursuit of the  Sherwin-Williams  Claims  (excluding  any  counter-claim  or
portion  thereof that is accrued in Closing Working Capital in the Final Closing
Adjustment Amount Statement), or (y) irrevocably relinquishes to Gentek Holdings
and its Subsidiaries all control over the conduct of any counter-claims  made in
the  Pending  Sherwin-Williams  Litigation  or arising out of the pursuit of the
Sherwin-Williams  Claims (excluding any counter-claim or portion thereof that is
accrued  in  Closing  Working  Capital in the Final  Closing  Adjustment  Amount
Statement).

          (e) Sellers and Sellers'  Representative  shall cause any successor to
the Trustee to execute a counter-part to this Agreement.  Any successor  Trustee
shall  be a  director  or  officer  of  Genstar  or a  U.S.  commercial  banking
institution holding trustee powers.

          (f)  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  set  forth  in  this
Agreement or any other  document  executed by the parties hereto with respect to
the Pending  Sherwin-Williams  Litigation or the  Sherwin-Williams  Claims, each
Seller, each holder of Options,  Sherwin-Williams  Claims Trust and the Sellers'
Representative  hereby waives,  to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, and agrees not to assert,  any and all rights,  claims and causes of action
(including any and all claims for Liabilities,  losses,  damages,  claims, costs
and expenses,  interest,  awards, judgments and penalties incurred thereby) such
Person or any of its affiliates may have against  Purchaser,  Gentek Holdings or
any of their respective affiliates resulting from, arising out of or relating to
the  assignment  and  transfer  (including  any  failure  or defect  thereof  or
illegality  with  respect  thereto)  of the rights and  benefits  arising out of
Pending  Sherwin-Williams  Litigation and the Sherwin-Williams  Claims by Gentek
Holdings  and  its   Subsidiaries   to  the   Sherwin-Williams   Claims   Trust.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Purchaser,  Gentek Holdings and their respective
affiliates  hereby  waive and agree not to assert  any  failure  or defect in or
illegality of, or otherwise  challenge the enforceability of, the assignment and
transfer  of the rights and  benefits  arising  out of Pending  Sherwin-Williams
Litigation  and  the   Sherwin-Williams   Claims  by  Gentek  Holdings  and  its
Subsidiaries  to the  Sherwin-Williams  Claims  Trust.  In the  event  that  the
assignment  or  transfer  of the  rights  and  benefits  arising  out of Pending
Sherwin-Williams    Litigation   or   the   Sherwin-Williams   Claims   to   the
Sherwin-Williams Claims Trust is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid,  illegal or incapable of being  enforced by any Law or public policy or
otherwise to compromise the enforceability of the claims asserted in the Pending
Sherwin-Williams Litigation or the Sherwin-Williams Claims,

                                                                            -53-

Purchaser,  Gentek Holdings,  its  Subsidiaries and their respective  affiliates
shall, at the sole cost and expense of the  Sherwin-Williams  Claims Trust, take
(or cause to be taken),  and do (or cause to be done),  and execute (or cause to
be executed),  all things and documents necessary,  proper or advisable in order
to carry  out and  effectuate  to the  greatest  extent  possible,  in a legally
enforceable  manner,  the economic  intent of the assignment and transfer of the
rights and benefits arising out of Pending  Sherwin-Williams  Litigation and the
Sherwin-Williams Claims to the Sherwin-Williams Claims Trust, including, without
limitation,   by   collecting   all   proceeds   realized   from   the   Pending
Sherwin-Williams  Litigation or the pursuit of the  Sherwin-Williams  Claims and
promptly  contributing  such  proceeds,  less  costs,  (or an amount  equivalent
thereto) to the  Sherwin-Williams  Claims Trust in accordance  with the terms of
this Section 6.08.

          (g)  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  set  forth  in  this
Agreement,  Purchaser  agrees that breach of the terms of this  Section 6.08 may
cause irreparable loss to the Sherwin-Williams Claims Trust and that damages may
be  impossible to ascertain,  and therefore  hereby  consents to the granting of
equitable  relief by way of  temporary,  preliminary  and  permanent  injunctive
relief, by a court of competent jurisdiction, to prohibit such breach and compel
compliance with the terms of this Section 6.08.

          (h) The cash proceeds of any settlement of or judgment  related to the
Pending  Sherwin-Williams  Litigation and the  Sherwin-Williams  Claims realized
after the Closing (the "SVA Amount") shall be apportioned among Gentek Holdings,
on the one hand, and the  Sherwin-Williams  Claims Trust,  on the other hand, as
follows:

               (i) any SVA Amount  attributable  to periods prior to the Closing
shall be and become the property of the Sherwin-Williams  Claims Trust and shall
be promptly paid over to the Sherwin-Williams Claims Trust;

               (ii) any SVA Amount  attributable  to periods  after the  Closing
shall be apportioned among the Sherwin-Williams Claims Trust and Gentek Holdings
in  accordance  with the  Sharing  Formula,  and Gentek  Holdings  or any of its
Subsidiaries shall pay over to the Sherwin-Williams  Claims Trust promptly after
the  settlement  or  judgment  referred  to  above,  the TR  Share  in  cash  in
consideration for assignment by the Sherwin-Williams  Claims Trust of the rights
and benefits under any settlement or judgment contemplated by clause (A) of this
Section  6.08(h)(ii)  unless,  pursuant  to the  terms  of  such  settlement  or
judgment,  Gentek Holdings or any of its  Subsidiaries  receives such rights and
benefits.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Gentek Holdings and its Subsidiaries
shall not be required to pay the TR Share to the  Sherwin-Williams  Claims Trust
and the Sherwin-Williams Claims Trust shall not be required to assign the rights
and  benefits  under any  settlement  or judgment  contemplated  by this Section
6.08(h)(ii)  (A) unless,  pursuant to the terms of such  settlement or judgment,
Sherwin-Williams  agrees or is required to  reimburse  Gentek  Holdings  and its
Subsidiaries  in cash for at least fifty percent (50%) of the costs  incurred by
Gentek  Holdings and its  Subsidiaries  after the Closing for the remediation of
Steel Peel Claims,  it being  understood,  and Sellers and the  Sherwin-Williams
Claims Trust hereby agree, that the Sherwin-Williams Claims Trust shall transfer
and assign to Gentek Holdings and its

                                                                            -54-

Subsidiaries the rights and benefits of any settlement or judgment  contemplated
by  this  Section  6.08(h)(ii)(A),   or  (B)  if  the  Pending  Sherwin-Williams
Litigation or other Sherwin-Williams Claims are not settled or resolved pursuant
to a judgment on or prior to the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date.

By way of example,  and for reference  purposes  only, in the event that (A) one
year  after  the  Closing,  the  Pending  Sherwin-Williams  Litigation  and  the
Sherwin-Williams  Claims  are  settled  and,  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  such
settlement, Sherwin-Williams agrees to pay an amount of cash ("X") in respect of
pre-Closing  items and to reimburse Gentek Holdings and its Subsidiaries in cash
for 75% of all costs incurred by Gentek Holdings and its Subsidiaries  after the
Closing for the  remediation of the Steel Peel Claims,  and (B) Gentek  Holdings
and its Subsidiaries  expended  $1,000,000 on remediating Steel Peel Claims from
the Closing Date to the time of such  settlement  at a rate of $2,739.73 per day
for such year, the SVA Amount (consisting of X (Section 6.08(h)(i)) and the cash
proceeds from Sherwin-Williams' 75% warranty) would be apportioned as follows:

                    (1) X would  be paid  over  to the  Sherwin-Williams  Claims
Trust; and

                    (2)  the TR  Share  of  $3,567,873  (i.e.,  $5,000,000  less
$242,836  (i.e.  the  present  value of all sums  expended  after the Closing in
remediating  any Steel  Peel  Claims  which are not being  reimbursed  to Gentek
Holdings and its  Subsidiaries by  Sherwin-Williams,  discounted at a rate of 6%
per annum) multiplied by 0.75) would be paid over to the Sherwin-Williams Claims
Trust.

     Section  6.09.  Purchaser  Financing  Arrangements.   Purchaser  shall  use
commercially  reasonable efforts to satisfy the requirements of the Best Efforts
Letter and to obtain the funding  contemplated  by and on the terms contained in
the Best Efforts  Letter,  or if the Best Efforts  Letter is  terminated or such
funds  shall not  otherwise  be  available,  shall use  commercially  reasonable
efforts to obtain an alternative  source of financing in order to consummate the
transactions  contemplated  hereby.  Following the date hereof,  any  amendment,
termination or cancellation of the Best Efforts Letter or any information  known
to  Purchaser,  which makes it unlikely to obtain the financing set forth in the
Best Efforts  Letter,  shall be promptly  disclosed to Sellers'  Representative.
Neither  Purchaser  nor  any  of  its  affiliates  shall  attempt,  directly  or
indirectly,  to intentionally  induce or encourage the exercise by the Arrangers
of any right not to fund any of the  financing  provided for in the Best Efforts
Letter.

     Section 6.10. Sellers' Representative. Sellers hereby irrevocably designate
Sellers' Representative to execute any and all instruments or other documents on
behalf  of  Sellers,  and to do any and all  other  acts or  things on behalf of
Sellers, which Sellers' Representative may deem necessary or advisable, or which
may be required pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or otherwise in
connection with the  consummation of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby and
thereby and the  performance of all  obligations  hereunder and thereunder at or
following  the  Closing.  Without  limiting  the  generality  of the  foregoing,
Sellers' Representative shall have the

                                                                            -55-
<PAGE>

full and  exclusive  authority to (i) agree with  Purchaser  with respect to any
matter or thing  required  or deemed  necessary  by Sellers'  Representative  in
connection with the provisions of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement calling
for the agreement of Sellers, give and receive notices on behalf of all Sellers,
and act on behalf  of all  Sellers  in  connection  with any  matter as to which
Sellers are or may be obligated  under this  Agreement or the Escrow  Agreement,
all in the absolute discretion of Sellers'  Representative,  (ii) in general, do
all things and perform all acts,  including,  without limitation,  executing and
delivering  all  agreements,   certificates,   receipts,  consents,   elections,
instructions,  and other instruments or documents  contemplated by, or deemed by
Sellers'  Representative  to be necessary or advisable in connection  with, this
Agreement  or the Escrow  Agreement,  and (iii) take all  actions  necessary  or
desirable   in   connection   with  the  defense   and/or   settlement   of  any
indemnification  claims  pursuant to Article X and  performance  of  obligations
under Article II. Sellers shall cooperate with Sellers'  Representative  and any
accountants,  attorneys or other agents whom it may retain to assist in carrying
out its duties  hereunder.  All  decisions by Sellers'  Representative  shall be
binding upon all Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object, dissent,
protest or otherwise contest the same.  Sellers'  Representative may communicate
with any Seller or any other Person concerning his  responsibilities  hereunder,
but it is not required to do so. Sellers'  Representative has a duty to serve in
good faith the  interests  of Sellers and to perform its  designated  role under
this Agreement,  but Sellers'  Representative  shall have no financial liability
whatsoever to any Person relating to its service hereunder (including any action
taken or omitted to be taken),  except that it shall be liable for harm which it
directly  causes by an act of willful  misconduct.  Sellers shall  indemnify and
hold  harmless  Sellers'  Representative  against any loss,  expense  (including
reasonable  attorney's  fees) or other  liability  arising out of its service as
Sellers'  Representative  under this  Agreement,  other  than for harm  directly
caused by an act of willful misconduct.  Sellers'  Representative may not resign
without the prior written  consent of Purchaser.  Purchaser shall be entitled to
rely on the authority of Sellers'  Representative  as the agent,  representative
and  attorney-in-fact  of each Seller for all purposes  under this Agreement and
the  Escrow  Agreement  and  Purchaser  shall  have no  liability  for any  such
reliance.

     Section 6.11.  Notification  of Certain  Matters.  Sellers'  Representative
shall give prompt  notice to  Purchaser  of the  occurrence  or existence of any
fact,  circumstance or event which would be reasonably  likely to result,  as of
the  Closing,   in  the  failure  of  any  condition  precedent  to  Purchaser's
obligations under this Agreement.

     Section 6.12.  Settlement of Payables.  The parties agree that all payables
(except for trade  accounts  receivable  and payable in the  ordinary  course of
business)  between  Sellers,  the  holders of  Options,  Genstar or any of their
respective affiliates (other than Gentek Holdings and its Subsidiaries),  on the
one hand,  and Gentek  Holdings or any of its  Subsidiaries,  on the other hand,
shall be settled at or prior to the Closing, provided that such amounts have not
been accrued in accounts payable reflected in Working Capital as of the Closing.

                                                                            -56-

     Section 6.13. Employees.

          (a) Purchaser  shall maintain the Cash Incentive  Bonus Award Plan and
other incentive  compensation  plans set forth in Section 6.13 of the Disclosure
Schedule  (collectively,  the  "Current  Incentive  Plans")  for  those  persons
employed by Gentek Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries  immediately prior to the
Closing, including those employees on vacation, leave of absence,  disability or
sick leave or layoff (whether or not such employees return to active  employment
with  Gentek  Holdings  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries)  (each,  a  "Transferred
Employee",  and collectively,  the "Transferred  Employees") (if applicable) and
any other  service  providers  of  Gentek  Holdings  or any of its  Subsidiaries
participating  in the  Current  Incentive  Plans  immediately  prior to  Closing
(subject to the terms of the Current Incentive Plans) through December 31, 2003,
and shall make the payments  (including any amounts accrued thereunder as of the
Closing)  contemplated by the applicable Current Incentive Plans (if applicable)
in  accordance  with the  payment  schedule  pursuant to which  Purchaser  makes
comparable  payments  under its own incentive  plans.  If a  participant  in any
Current  Incentive  Plan is  terminated  without  "cause" or  resigns  for "good
reason"  (in each  case as such  terms are  defined  in the  applicable  Current
Incentive Plan or, if not so defined,  as reasonably  determined by Purchaser in
good  faith)  after the  Closing,  he or she will be vested in a portion  of the
benefit under the  applicable  Current  Incentive Plan accrued as of the date of
termination,  or, if not so accrued, to a portion of the annualized payment that
such  participant  would have received  under the applicable  Current  Incentive
Plan,  multiplied  by the number of days such person was an employee  during the
calendar year of 2003, divided by 365.

          (b) To the extent that service is relevant for purposes of eligibility
or vesting under any employee benefit plan,  program or arrangement  established
or maintained by Purchaser,  Gentek Holdings or any of its  Subsidiaries for the
benefit of any  Transferred  Employees,  Purchaser  shall  cause each such plan,
program or arrangement to credit such employees for service with Gentek Holdings
or any of its  Subsidiaries  on or prior to the  Closing to the extent that such
service is recognized for similar  purposes  under the same or similar  employee
benefit plans,  programs or  arrangements  in which the  applicable  Transferred
Employee participates prior to the Closing.

     Section 6.14.  Statement of Outstanding Draft Amounts.  On the date one (1)
business day immediately prior to the Closing Date, Sellers' Representative,  on
behalf of  Sellers,  shall  cause  Gentek  Holdings  to prepare  and  deliver to
Sellers'  Representative  and  Purchaser a statement  (which shall be reasonably
satisfactory  to Purchaser)  setting forth the aggregate face amount of all bank
checks drawn on the accounts of Gentek Holdings and its  Subsidiaries  that will
be  outstanding  and unpaid as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the
"Outstanding  Draft Amount"),  it being  understood  that, prior to the Closing,
none of Gentek Holdings or any of its  Subsidiaries  shall issue any bank checks
or take any other  action that would  result in an  increase in the  Outstanding
Draft Amount.

                                                                            -57-

                                   ARTICLE VII.

                                   TAX MATTERS

     Section  7.01.  Allocation  of Taxes.  All Taxes and Tax  liabilities  with
respect to the income,  property or operations of Gentek  Holdings or any of its
Subsidiaries that relate to the Overlap Period shall be apportioned  between the
Pre-Closing Period and the period after the Closing Date as follows:  (i) in the
case of Taxes other than income,  sales and use and withholding  Taxes, on a per
diem basis, and (ii) in the case of income, sales and use and withholding Taxes,
as  determined  from the books and  records  of  Gentek  Holdings  or any of its
Subsidiaries as though the taxable year of Gentek Holdings and such Subsidiaries
terminated at the close of business on the Closing  Date.  Purchaser and Sellers
agree to the extent  permitted  by  applicable  Law to elect  with the  relevant
taxing authority to treat for all purposes the Closing Date as the last day of a
taxable period of Gentek Holdings and its Subsidiaries.

     Section 7.02. Controversies.

          (a) Purchaser  shall notify  Sellers'  Representative  upon receipt by
Purchaser  or any  affiliate  of Purchaser  (including  Gentek  Holdings and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date) of written notice of any inquiries, claims,
assessments,  audits or  similar  events  with  respect to Taxes  relating  to a
taxable  period  ending on or prior to the Closing Date for which Sellers may be
liable under this  Agreement  (any such  inquiry,  claim,  assessment,  audit or
similar event, a "Tax Matter").  Sellers'  Representative,  at its sole expense,
shall have the authority to represent the interests of Gentek Holdings or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to any Tax Matter before the IRS, any other taxing
authority,  any other  governmental  agency or  authority or any court and shall
have the right to control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any Tax
Matter; provided, however, that Sellers' Representative shall not enter into any
settlement of or otherwise  compromise any Tax Matter that adversely  affects or
may adversely  affect the Tax liability of Purchaser,  Gentek Holdings or any of
its  Subsidiaries  or any affiliate of the foregoing for any period ending after
the Closing Date,  including the portion of the Overlap Period that is after the
Closing  Date,  without the prior written  consent of  Purchaser,  which consent
shall  not  be   unreasonably   withheld,   conditioned  or  delayed.   Sellers'
Representative  shall keep the Purchaser  fully and timely informed with respect
to the  commencement,  status and  nature of any Tax  Matter and shall,  in good
faith,  allow  Purchaser  to  make  comments  to  the  Sellers'  Representative,
regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such proceeding.

          (b) Except as otherwise  provided in Section 7.02(a) above,  Purchaser
shall  have the sole  right to control  any audit or  examination  by any taxing
authority and contest,  resolve and defend against any assessment for additional
Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating to,
the income, assets or operations of Gentek Holdings and its Subsidiaries for all
taxable  periods;  provided,   however,  Purchaser  shall  not  enter  into  any
settlement of or otherwise  compromise any Tax matter that adversely  affects or
may adversely  affect Sellers with respect to their  obligations for Taxes under
this Agreement without the prior written consent of Sellers'

                                                                            -58-

Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed;  provided further,  that upon receipt of written notice of any inquiry,
claim,  assessment,  audit or similar event with respect to a Tax matter arising
out of an Overlap  Period,  Purchaser  shall provide  written  notice thereof to
Sellers' Representative.

     Section 7.03. Tax Returns/Payment of Taxes.

          (a) After the  Closing  Date,  except as  otherwise  provided  herein,
Purchaser shall file or cause to be filed (and shall have the exclusive right to
file or cause to be filed) all Tax  Returns  (including  amended Tax Returns and
claims for  refunds)  of Gentek  Holdings  or any of its  Subsidiaries.  Any Tax
Return of Gentek  Holdings or any of its  Subsidiaries  which is filed after the
Closing Date and which  pertains to a  Pre-Closing  Period or an Overlap  Period
shall be (i) prepared in accordance with past practices to the extent  permitted
by applicable  law and (ii)  submitted  (with copies of relevant work papers and
other  documentation  then  available,  to  the  extent  such  work  papers  and
documentation  either solely  pertain to a Pre-Closing  Period or are not deemed
confidential by the Purchaser) to the Seller's  Representative  for approval not
less than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the due date for the filing of such
Tax Return,  which approval shall not be unreasonably  withheld,  conditioned or
delayed. If Seller's  Representative does not notify the Purchaser in writing of
any  objection  Seller's  Representative  may have to such Tax  Returns at least
fifteen  (15)  calendar  days  prior to the due date for the  filing of such Tax
Returns,  Seller's  Representative  shall be  deemed to have  approved  such Tax
Returns. For Tax Returns that relate solely to periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date,  unless  otherwise  required by applicable  Law,  Purchaser  shall
follow Seller's  Representatives comments with respect to the reporting of items
on such Tax  Returns to the extent that  either (x)  pursuant to such  comments,
such items are treated in a manner  consistent with the past practices of Gentek
Holdings  and  its  Subsidiaries,  or  (y)  Purchaser  determines  in  its  sole
discretion  that such  comments  could not  adversely  affect  Purchaser  or its
Affiliates  (including Gentek Holdings and its Subsidiaries).  Any objections to
such Tax Returns  shall be  resolved by treating  items on such Tax Returns in a
manner   consistent   with  the  past  practices  of  Gentek  Holdings  and  its
Subsidiaries (as confirmed by an independent  accountant,  at the shared expense
of the parties, if necessary).  With respect to Taxes due after the Closing Date
that relate to the income,  property or operations of Gentek  Holdings or any of
its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Period, to the extent such Taxes were not set
forth as a current  Liability  (or in  Closing  Net  Indebtedness)  on the Final
Closing Date Working Capital,  an amount shall be paid from the  Indemnification
Escrow to the  Purchasers  five (5) business  days prior to the due date of such
Taxes.

          (b) Except as required by  applicable  Law,  neither  Purchaser or any
affiliate of Purchaser shall (or shall cause or permit Gentek Holdings or any of
its Subsidiaries  to) amend,  refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating
in whole or part to Gentek Holdings or any of its  Subsidiaries  with respect to
any  taxable  year or period  ending on or before the Closing  Date  without the
prior written consent of the Seller's  Representative,  which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Sellers' Representative may file,
or cause  Gentek  Holdings or any of its  Subsidiaries  to file,  an amended Tax
Return or claim for refund with respect to a taxable

                                                                            -59-
<PAGE>

year or period  ending  on or before  the  Closing  Date with the prior  written
consent  of  Purchaser,  which  consent  shall  not  be  unreasonably  withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Any Tax refund received by Purchaser, Gentek Holdings or
any of its Subsidiaries, and any amounts of overpayments of Tax credited against
Tax which Purchaser,  Gentek Holdings or any of its Subsidiaries otherwise would
be or would have been  required  to pay that relate to any  taxable  period,  or
portion  thereof,  ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the account
of Sellers,  and Purchaser  shall pay over to Seller's  Representative  any such
refund or the amount of any such credit within  fifteen (15) calendar days after
it is actually received or so credited against Tax; provided,  however, that (i)
any Taxes that are imposed on Purchaser or any of its  Affiliates as a result of
a  disallowance  or  reduction of any Tax refund or credit with respect to which
Purchaser has made a payment to Sellers  pursuant to this Section  7.03(b) shall
be treated as a Tax for which  Sellers  are  obligated  to  indemnify  Purchaser
pursuant to Section  10.04(a)(ii)  hereof as if it  resulted  from a breach of a
representation set forth in Section 4.17 without any exclusions or defenses, and
(ii) nothing in this Section  7.03(b)  shall  require  Purchaser to disclose any
confidential  information to Sellers  (including,  without  limitation,  its Tax
Returns).

     Section 7.04. Prior Tax Agreements.  Sellers shall terminate or cause to be
terminated  any and  all of the  tax  sharing,  allocation,  indemnification  or
similar  agreements,   arrangements  or  undertakings  in  effect,   written  or
unwritten,  on the  Closing  Date as between  any Seller or any  predecessor  or
affiliate  thereof,  on  the  one  hand,  and  Gentek  Holdings  or  any  of its
Subsidiaries,  on the other hand,  for all Taxes  imposed by any  government  or
taxing authority,  regardless of the period in which such Taxes are imposed, and
there shall be no  continuing  obligation  to make any  payments  under any such
agreements, arrangements or undertakings.

     Section 7.05.  Assistance  and  Cooperation.  Sellers'  Representative  and
Purchaser and its  Affiliates  shall at the  requesting  party's  expense:  make
available to the other and to any Taxing  authority as reasonably  requested all
information, records, and documents relating to Taxes concerning Gentek Holdings
and its Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing periods; make available to the other and to
any Taxing  authority as reasonably  requested  (during normal  business  hours)
employees  and  independent  auditors  to provide  explanations  and  additional
information   relating  to  Taxes   concerning  the  Gentek   Holdings  and  its
Subsidiaries  for  Pre-Closing  Periods;  and retain any books and records  that
could  reasonably  be  expected to be  necessary  or useful in  connection  with
Sellers' Representative's or Purchaser's preparation, as the case may be, of any
Tax Return, or for any audit, examination, or proceeding relating to Taxes. Such
books and  records  shall be retained  until the  expiration  of the  applicable
statute of limitations (including extensions thereof to the extent the party has
been  notified  thereof);  provided,  however,  that in the  event of an  audit,
examination,  investigation  or  proceeding  has  been  instituted  prior to the
expiration  of the  applicable  statute of  limitations  (or in the event of any
claim under this Agreement), the books and records shall be retained until there
is a final  determination  thereof  (and the time for any appeal  has  expired);
provided  further,  however,  that nothing in this Section 7.05 shall  require a
party to retain any books or records beyond six (6) years after the Closing Date
if the Seller's  Representative or Purchaser, as the case may be, has offered in

                                                                            -60-
<PAGE>

writing to  deliver  such  books and  records  to the other  party (at the other
party's  expense) and the other party  either  declined to accept such books and
records or failed to respond to such request  within ninety (90) calendar  days.

     Section 7.06. Survival.  Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the
contrary,  the  provisions  of this  Article  VII shall  survive  for sixty (60)
calendar  days after the full  period of all  statutes  of  limitations  (giving
effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).

                                  ARTICLE VIII.

                              CONDITIONS TO CLOSING

          (b) Regulatory  Consents and Approvals.  Purchaser and Gentek Holdings

the ISRA Approvals.

          (c) No  Governmental  Order.  No  Governmental  Authority  shall  have

          (d) No Proceeding or  Litigation.  No Action shall have been commenced
by or before any Governmental  Authority against any Seller or Purchaser seeking

Representative  or Purchaser is likely to prevent the parties from  consummating
the  transactions  contemplated  this  Agreement;  provided,  however,  that the
provisions  of this  Section  8.01(d)  shall not  apply to any  party  which has
directly or indirectly solicited or encouraged any such Action.

in all  material  respects as of the Closing Date with the same force and effect

foregoing  but without  prejudicing  any right or  entitlement  of  Purchaser to
receipt of full  indemnification  under this  Article X from  monies held in the
Indemnification  Escrow,  no Seller  shall have any  indemnification  obligation

Canada in this  Agreement,  the maximum  amount that may be  recovered  from any

the  failure of any  representation  or  warranty  made by the  Sherwin-Williams
Claims Trust  contained in this Agreement to be true and correct in all respects
as of the date  hereof and as of the Closing  Date  (determined  without  giving
effect to any "material,"  "Material  Adverse Effect" or similar  qualification,

thirty  (30)  calendar  days of such  determination,  stating  the amount of the
Indemnified Seller Loss or Indemnified Purchaser Loss, as applicable,  if known,
and method of  computation  thereof,  and containing a description in reasonable
detail of the basis for such claim and a reference to the  provision(s)  of this
Agreement  in  respect  of which  such  right of  indemnification  is claimed or
arises;  provided,  however,  that the failure to provide  such notice shall not
release the Indemnifying  Party from any of its obligations under this Article X
except to the extent the  Indemnifying  Party is  materially  prejudiced by such
failure and shall not relieve the  Indemnifying  Party from any other obligation
or Liability that it may have to any Indemnified Party otherwise than under this
Article X.

          (b) The  obligations  and  Liabilities of Purchaser or Sellers and the
Sherwin-Williams  Claims Trust under this Article X with respect to  Indemnified
Seller Losses or Indemnified  Purchaser Losses, as the case may be, arising from
claims of any third party other than  claims  with  respect to Taxes  (which are
covered in  Section  7.02)  ("Third  Party  Claims")  shall be  governed  by and
contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions:

               (i) If an  Indemnified  Party shall  receive  notice of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnified  Party shall give the Indemnifying  Party notice of
such Third Party Claim within  twenty (20)  calendar  days of the receipt by the
Indemnified Party of notice of such Third Party Claim;  provided,  however, that
the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from
any  of  its  obligations  under  this  Article  X  except  to  the  extent  the
Indemnifying  Party is  materially  prejudiced  by such  failure  and  shall not
relieve the  Indemnifying  Party from any other  obligation or Liability that it
may have to any Indemnified Party otherwise than under this Article X.

               (ii) If (x) the  Indemnifying  Party  acknowledges in writing its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified  Party hereunder against any Indemnified
Seller Loss or Indemnified  Purchaser  Loss, as the case may be, that may result
from such Third Party Claim, and (y) in any case where the Indemnified  Party is
an Indemnified  Purchaser Party, the liabilities arising out of such Third Party
Claim would not  reasonably  be expected to exceed an amount  equal to two times
the amount of the Indemnifying  Party's  indemnification  obligations under this
Article X in respect of any  Indemnified  Purchaser  Losses  arising out of such
Third Party Claim,  then the Indemnifying  Party shall be entitled to assume and
control  the  defense of such Third Party Claim at its sole cost and expense and
through counsel of its own choice by giving notice to the  Indemnified  Party of
its  intention  to do so within  fifteen  (15)  calendar  days of the receipt of
notice of such Third Party Claim from the Indemnified Party; provided,  however,
that (A) if there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest
that

                                                                            -70-
<PAGE>

would make it  inappropriate,  in the  reasonable,  good faith  judgment  of the
Indemnified  Party, for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party
and  Indemnifying  Party, or (B) if there is a reasonable  probability that such
Third Party Claim may have a material  adverse effect on the  Indemnified  Party
other  than as a result  of money  damages  or other  money  payments,  then the
Indemnified  Party shall be entitled to  participate  in the defense of (but not
control)  such Third  Party  Claim,  at its sole cost and  expense  and  through
counsel of its own choice;  and provided  further,  that (x) if such Third Party
Claims  involve a claim for an  injunction  against  any  material  business  or
operations of the  Indemnified  Party,  (y) if such Third Party Claim involves a
criminal proceeding,  action, indictment,  allegation or investigation or (z) if
such Third Party Claim  involves  any of the top twenty  (20)  customers  or top
twenty (20)  suppliers of Gentek  Holdings or any of its  Subsidiaries,  in each
case for the year 2002, then the  Indemnified  Party shall be entitled to retain
control of the  defense of such Third  Party  Claim and the  Indemnifying  Party
shall be entitled to  participate  in the defense of such Third Party Claim,  at
its sole cost and expense and through counsel of its own choice. Upon receipt by
an Indemnified  Party of written notice of the Indemnifying  Party's election to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the  Indemnifying  Party shall not
be liable to such  Indemnified  Party for expenses  incurred  thereafter  by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such Third Party Claim.

               (iii) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall exercise its
right to  undertake  any such defense  against any such Third Party  Claim,  the
Indemnified  Party shall cooperate with the  Indemnifying  Party in such defense
and make available to the Indemnifying  Party, at the Indemnifying  Party's sole
cost and expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in
the  Indemnified  Party's  possession or under the  Indemnified  Party's control
relating  thereto  as  is  reasonably   requested  by  the  Indemnifying  Party.
Similarly,  in the  event the  Indemnified  Party is,  directly  or  indirectly,
controlling or  participating in the defense against any such Third Party Claim,
the  Indemnifying  Party  shall  cooperate  with the  Indemnified  Party in such
defense and make available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party's
sole cost and expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in
the Indemnifying  Party's  possession or under the Indemnifying  Party's control
relating thereto as is reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party.

               (iv) No Third  Party  Claim may be  settled  by the  Indemnifying
Party or the  Indemnified  Party,  as the case may be, without the prior written
consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld or
delayed).

     Section 10.06. Limitations on Indemnification.

          (a) The maximum  amount of  Indemnified  Seller Losses or  Indemnified
Purchaser Losses, as applicable,  which may be recovered from Purchaser, Sellers
or  the   Sherwin-Williams   Claims  Trust,  as  applicable,   pursuant  to  the
indemnification  obligations set forth in Section 10.03(i), Section 10.04(a)(i),
Section  10.04(a)(ii)  and Section  10.04(b)(i)  shall be an amount equal to the
funds then held in the Indemnification Escrow;  provided,  however, that (i) the
limitations   contained  in  this  Section  10.06(a)  shall  not  apply  to  any
Indemnified Purchaser Losses

                                                                            -71-

and warranties  contained in Section 3.01  (Authority),  Section 3.04 (Brokers),
Section 3.05  (Ownership of Shares and Options),  Section 4.02 (Capital Stock of
Gentek  Holdings,  Gentek U.S. and Gentek Canada) and Section 4.17 (Taxes) to be
true and  correct in all  respects  as of the date  hereof and as of the Closing
Date  (determined  without giving effect to any  "material,"  "Material  Adverse
Effect" or similar qualification, whether in such representation and warranty or
any defined term contained in such representation and warranty and, with respect
to Section 4.17 (Taxes) only,  determined  without  giving effect to any matters
set  forth  in the  Disclosure  Schedule),  or  any  Indemnified  Seller  Losses
resulting from, arising out of or relating to the failure of the representations
and warranties contained in Section 5.01 (Organization and Authority) to be true
and correct in all  respects  as of the date hereof and as of the Closing  Date,
and (ii) the limitations  contained in this Section  10.06(a) shall not apply to
any Indemnified  Purchaser  Losses to the extent that the funds then held in the
Indemnification  Escrow  have been  reduced or depleted as a result of any claim
for indemnification resulting from, arising out of or relating to the failure of
the representations and warranties  contained in Section 4.17 (Taxes) to be true
and correct in all  respects  as of the date  hereof and as of the Closing  Date
(determined  without giving effect to any "material,"  "Material Adverse Effect"
or similar  qualification,  whether in such  representation  and warranty or any
defined term contained in such  representation and warranty and, with respect to
Section 4.17 (Taxes) only,  determined  without giving effect to any matters set
forth in the Disclosure Schedule);  provided,  however, that notwithstanding the
foregoing proviso,  (x) the maximum amount of Indemnified  Purchaser Losses that
may be recovered from any Seller shall be such Seller's  Percentage Share of the
Purchase  Price,  provided,  that the foregoing shall not prejudice any right or
entitlement of Purchaser to receipt of full indemnifications  under this Article
X from  monies held in the  Indemnification  Escrow,  (y) the maximum  aggregate
amount  of  Indemnified   Purchaser  Losses  that  may  be  recovered  from  the
Sherwin-Williams  Claims  Trust  shall be an amount  equal to the assets held or
recovered  by the  Sherwin-Williams  Claims  Trust,  and (z)  that  the  maximum
aggregate  amount  of  Indemnified  Seller  Losses  that may be  recovered  from
Purchaser shall be the Purchase Price.

          (b) The  indemnification  obligations  of  Purchaser,  Sellers and the
Sherwin-Williams Claims Trust pursuant to Section 10.03(i), Section 10.04(a)(i),
Section  10.04(a)(ii)  and  Section  10.04(b)(i),  respectively,  shall  not  be
effective unless and until the aggregate dollar amount of all Indemnified Seller
Losses  or  Indemnified  Purchaser  Losses,  as the  case  may be,  which  would
otherwise be recoverable from Purchaser,  Sellers or the Sherwin-Williams Claims
Trust, as applicable,  pursuant to the indemnification  obligations set forth in
Section  10.03(i),   Section  10.04(a)(i),   Section  10.04(a)(ii)  and  Section
10.04(b)(i),  respectively,  exceeds Seven Hundred Thousand  Dollars  ($700,000)
(the  "Threshold  Amount"),  and then only to the extent such  aggregate  amount
exceeds  the  Threshold  Amount;  provided,  however,  that (i) the  limitations
contained in this Section 10.06(b) shall not apply to any Indemnified  Purchaser
Losses  resulting  from,  arising  out  of or  relating  to the  failure  of the
representations  and warranties  contained in Section 3.01 (Authority),  Section
3.04  (Brokers),  Section 3.05  (Ownership of Shares and Options),  Section 4.02
(Capital  Stock of Gentek  Holdings,  Gentek U.S. and Gentek Canada) and Section
4.17 (Taxes) to be

                                                                            -72-

Date  (determined  without giving effect to any  "material,"  "Material  Adverse
Effect" or similar qualification, whether in such representation and warranty or
any defined term contained in such representation and warranty and, with respect

set  forth  in the  Disclosure  Schedule),  or  any  Indemnified  Seller  Losses
resulting from, arising out of or relating to the failure of the representations
and warranties contained in Section 5.01 (Organization and Authority) to be true
and correct in all  respects  as of the date hereof and as of the Closing  Date,
(ii) Sellers shall not be liable for Indemnified Purchaser Losses arising out of
or relating to the failure of the  representations  and warranties  contained in
Section  4.17  (Taxes)  to be true and  correct in all  respects  as of the date
hereof and as of the  Closing  Date  (determined  without  giving  effect to any
"material," "Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualification,  whether in such
representation and warranty or any defined term contained in such representation
and warranty and, with respect to Section 4.17 (Taxes) only,  determined without
giving effect to any matters set forth in the  Disclosure  Schedule)  unless and
until the  aggregate  dollar  amount of all such  Indemnified  Purchaser  Losses
exceed Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000), and then only to the extent that
such Indemnified  Purchaser  Losses exceed such amount,  and (iii) Sellers shall
not be liable for Indemnified Purchaser Losses arising out of or relating to the
failure of the representations and warranties  contained in Section 4.17 (Taxes)
to be true and  correct  in all  respects  as of the date  hereof  and as of the
Closing Date  (determined  without  giving effect to any  "material,"  "Material
Adverse Effect" or similar  qualification,  whether in such  representation  and
warranty or any defined term contained in such  representation and warranty and,
with respect to Section 4.17 (Taxes) only,  determined  without giving effect to
any matters set forth in the  Disclosure  Schedule)  in excess of the funds then
held in the Indemnification  Escrow unless and until the aggregate dollar amount
of all such Indemnified Purchaser Losses in excess of the funds then held in the
Indemnification  Escrow exceed Two Million Five Hundred  Thousand  ($2,500,000),
and then only to the extent that such  Indemnified  Purchaser Losses exceed such
amount.

          (c)  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  set  forth  in  this
Agreement,  (i) prior to recovering any  Indemnified  Purchaser  Losses from any
Seller or the  Sherwin-Williams  Claims  Trust  pursuant to the  indemnification
obligations of Sellers or the Sherwin-Williams Claims Trust, as the case may be,
set forth in this Article X, an Indemnified  Purchaser Party shall first recover
such   Indemnified   Purchaser   Losses   from  the  funds   then  held  in  the
Indemnification  Escrow,  if any,  and  (ii) to the  extent  that  no  funds  or
insufficient  funds  are  then  held in the  Indemnification  Escrow,  prior  to
recovering  any  Indemnified  Purchaser  Losses from any Seller  pursuant to the
indemnification  obligations  of Sellers  set forth in Section  10.04(a)(v),  an
Indemnified  Purchaser  Party shall first  recover  such  Indemnified  Purchaser
Losses  pursuant  to the  indemnification  obligations  of the  Sherwin-Williams
Claims Trust set forth in Section  10.04(b)(iii) from the funds then held by the
Sherwin-Williams Claims Trust.

          (d)  For  the  purposes  of  this  Section  10.06,  in  computing  the
individual  or  aggregate  amounts of claims,  the amount of each claim shall be
calculated

                                                                            -73-

resulting from any such claims,  as reasonably  demonstrated  by the Indemnified
Party)  and any  indemnity,  contribution  or  other  similar  payment  actually
received by the  Indemnified  Party,  or any affiliate  thereof,  from any third
party with  respect  thereto  (it being  understood  and hereby  agreed that the
Indemnified  Party  shall use  commercially  reasonable  efforts to collect  any
available insurance proceeds and any indemnities, contributions or other similar
payments from third  parties,  but shall not be required to commence  litigation
against any third parties).

          (e) In the event that any  Indemnified  Purchaser Party is entitled to
indemnification  of any  Indemnified  Purchaser  Losses  pursuant to a claim for
indemnification  under  Section  10.04,  and such  Indemnified  Purchaser  Party
reasonably determines,  in good faith, that such Indemnified Purchaser Party has
actually  received or realized in connection  therewith any reduction of its Tax
Liabilities  (calculated  on the basis of the actual  reduction in cash payments
for Taxes) in or prior to the taxable year in which the  indemnification  amount
is paid (a "Tax Benefit"), the indemnification amount that Purchaser is entitled
to recover pursuant to a claim for indemnification  under Section 10.04 shall be
reduced,  on a dollar  for  dollar  basis,  by the  amount of such Tax  Benefit;
provided,  however,  that with respect to any Tax Benefit offset contemplated by
this Section 10.06(e),  (i) Purchaser shall not be obligated to file amended Tax
Returns  for such  purpose,  and (ii)  nothing in this  Section  10.06(e)  shall
require   Purchaser  to  disclose  any   confidential   information  to  Sellers
(including, without limitation, its Tax Returns).

                                   ARTICLE XI.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     Section 11.01.  Expenses.  Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement,
all costs and expenses, including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of
counsel,  financial  advisors and accountants,  incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the  transactions  contemplated  hereby shall be paid by the party
incurring  such  costs and  expenses,  whether  or not the  Closing  shall  have
occurred.  All fees payable under the  Competition  Act in  connection  with the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by Purchaser.

     Section 11.02. Notices. All notices,  requests,  claims,  demands and other
communications  hereunder  shall be in writing  and shall be deemed to have been
duly  delivered,  given or made:  (i) upon  receipt if delivered in person or by
cable or telegram, (ii) five (5) business days following deposit in the mails if
sent  by  registered  or  certified  mail  (postage   prepaid,   return  receipt
requested),  (iii) when sent,  if sent by  facsimile  transmission  and  receipt
thereof is  confirmed  by telephone  and (iv) two (2)  business  days  following
deposit with a nationally recognized overnight courier service, in each case, to
the  respective  parties  hereto at their  addresses  set forth on the signature
pages to this Agreement (or at such other address for a party hereto as shall be
specified in a notice given in accordance with this Section 11.02).

                                                                            -74-

          Section 11.03. Public Announcements.  No party to this Agreement shall
make, or cause to be made, any press release or public announcement with respect
to  this  Agreement  or  the  transactions   contemplated  hereby  or  otherwise
communicate  with any news media with respect  thereto without the prior written
consent of the other parties,  and the parties shall  cooperate as to the timing
and  contents  of any such  press  release  or  public  announcement;  provided,
however, that such prior written consent (i) shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned   or  delayed  and  (ii)  shall  not  be  required   for   releases,
announcements  or  communications  to the extent  obtaining  such prior  written
consent would prevent the timely and accurate  dissemination  of  information as
required to comply with any applicable Law or obligation pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange.  For the avoidance of doubt and
not by way of  limitation  or  restriction,  notwithstanding  anything  in  this
Agreement or the Confidentiality  Agreement to the contrary,  from and after the
Closing,  Sellers'  Representative  shall be  permitted to disclose the material
terms of the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement in connection  with
marketing and other similar activities in the ordinary course of business.

          Section 11.04.  Severability.  If any term or other  provision of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being  enforced,  all other terms and  provisions of this Agreement
shall  nevertheless  remain in full force and effect so long as the  economic or
legal substance of the transactions  contemplated  hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid,  illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall  negotiate  in good faith to modify this  Agreement so as to effect
the  original  intent of the  parties as closely as  possible  in an  acceptable
manner in order that the  transactions  contemplated  hereby are  consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

          Section 11.05. Entire Agreement.  This Agreement,  including the other
documents  referred to herein which form a part hereof,  constitutes  the entire
agreement of the parties  hereto with respect to the subject  matter  hereof and
supersedes  all  prior  agreements,  covenants,   representations,   warranties,
undertakings and understandings,  written or oral, among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof,  including the Exclusivity Agreement dated
as of May 14,  2003 among  Gentek  Holdings,  Genstar and  Purchaser;  provided,
however,  that the  Confidentiality  Agreement  shall continue to have force and
effect as provided in Section 6.03.

          Section  11.06.  Assignment.  This  Agreement may not be  transferred,
assigned, pledged or hypothecated, by operation of law or otherwise, without the
express written consent of Sellers'  Representative,  on behalf of Sellers,  and
Purchaser (which consent may be granted or withheld in the reasonable discretion
of each such party) except that  Purchaser  may without such consent  assign its
rights  under this  Agreement  to any of its  affiliates  or for the  purpose of
securing  any  financing  of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby;  provided,
however,  that no such assignment by Purchaser shall relieve Purchaser of any of
its obligations hereunder.

                                                                            -75-

          Section 11.07. No Third Party  Beneficiaries.  This Agreement shall be
binding  upon and inure  solely to the benefit of the  parties  hereto and their
permitted assigns and nothing herein, whether express or implied, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable  right,  benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

          Section 11.08. Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified except (i) by an instrument in writing signed
by Sellers'  Representative,  on behalf of Sellers,  and  Purchaser or (ii) by a
waiver in accordance with Section 9.03.

of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (each, a "Proceeding")
may be brought in the courts of the State of New York,  or in the United  States
District  Court for the Southern  District of New York,  and, by  execution  and
delivery of this  Agreement,  each of the parties to this Agreement  accepts the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any
judgment  rendered  thereby in  connection  with this  Agreement.  The foregoing
consent to  jurisdiction  shall not  constitute  general  consents to service of

shall not be deemed to confer  rights on any Person  other  than the  respective
parties to this  Agreement.  Each of the Sellers,  Sellers'  Representative  and
Purchaser agree that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S.
registered  mail to such  party's  address set forth  below  shall be  effective
service of process for any action,  suit or  proceeding in the State of New York

COUNTERPART  OF A COPY OF THIS  AGREEMENT  WITH  ANY  COURT AS  EVIDENCE  OF THE
CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

                                                                            -76-

taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
