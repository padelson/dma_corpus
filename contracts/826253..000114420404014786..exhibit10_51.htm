<p align=center><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b><u>INVESTMENT REPRESENTATION</u></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
  undersigned, _____________________ (the "Holder"), intends to acquire shares
  of Common Stock (the "Common Stock") of Aura Systems, Inc. (the "Company") from
  the Company pursuant to the exercise or conversion of a Warrant to purchase
  Common Stock held by the Holder.&nbsp; The Common Stock will be issued to the Holder
  in a transaction not involving a public offering and pursuant to an exemption
  from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
  Act"), and applicable state securities laws.&nbsp; In connection with such purchase
  and in order to comply with the exemptions from registration relied upon by
  the Company, the Holder represents, warrants and agrees as follows:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The Holder is acquiring the Common Stock for its own account, to hold for investment,
  and the Holder shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of the
  Common Stock in violation of the Securities Act or the General Rules and Regulations
  promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission or in violation
  of any applicable state securities law.&nbsp; The Holder is an "accredited investor"
  as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities
  Act.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The Holder has been advised that the Common Stock has not been registered under
  the Securities Act or state securities laws on the ground that this transaction
  is exempt from registration, and that reliance by the Company on such exemptions
  is predicated in part on the Holder's representations set forth herein.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The Holder has been informed that under the Securities Act, the Common Stock
  must be held indefinitely unless it is subsequently registered under the Securities
  Act or unless an exemption from such registration (such as Rule 144) is available
  with respect to any proposed transfer or disposition by the Holder of the Common
  Stock.&nbsp; The Holder further agrees that the Company may refuse to permit the
  Holder to sell, transfer or dispose of the Common Stock (except as permitted
  under Rule 144) unless there is in effect a registration statement under the
  Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws covering such transfer,
  or unless the Holder furnishes an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory
  to counsel for the Company to the effect that such registration is not required.&nbsp;
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The
  Holder also understands and agrees that there will be placed on the certificate(s)
  for the Common Stock or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> "The shares represented by this certificate
  have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
  Act"), or any state securities laws.&nbsp; These shares have been acquired for investment
  purposes and may not be sold or otherwise transferred in the absence of an effective
  registration statement for these shares under the Securities Act and applicable
  state securities laws or an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Company that
  registration is not required and that an applicable exemption is available."</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font size="1"><br>
