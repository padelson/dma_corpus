\- iv - AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November 22, 2009 (as amended,

corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

WHEREAS, Acquiror and the Company have agreed to enter into a business
combination transaction pursuant to which the Company will merge with and
into Acquiror, with Acquiror surviving the merger (the " _Merger_ ") on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Acquiror and the
Company have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
companies and stockholders to consummate the Merger and related transactions
provided for herein;

WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Agreement
is intended to be, and is hereby, adopted as a plan of reorganization within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g); and

WHEREAS, this Agreement contains the "plan of merger" described in Section
92A.100 of the Nevada Revised Statutes (as in effect from time to time, the "

agree as follows:

ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER

Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (as in
effect from time to time, the " _DGCL_ ") and the NRS, at the Effective
Time (as defined in _Section 1.2_), the Company shall merge with and into
Acquiror, whereupon the separate corporate existence of the Company shall

accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and (ii) an articles of
merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State
of Nevada, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the NRS. The Merger shall become effective upon (I)

of State of the State of Delaware and (y) such filing of the Articles of   Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada, or (II) such
later date and time specified in the Certificate of Merger and the Articles of

1.3. _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL and the NRS.

1.4. _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern time (i) promptly after, and in no event later than on the date that
is the third Business Day after, the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in _Article VIII_ hereof, other than conditions which by their terms
are to be satisfied at Closing or (ii) such other date or time as the parties
may mutually agree (the date on which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing
Date_ "). The Closing shall be held at the offices of Simpson Thacher and
Bartlett LLP, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017, unless another
place is agreed upon in writing by the parties. For purposes of this
Agreement, a " _Business Day_ " shall mean any day that is not a Saturday, a
Sunday or other day on which banking organizations in New York City are
required or authorized by Law to be closed.

1.5. _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation, as
amended, of Acquiror, as in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company
following the Merger until thereafter amended in accordance with the
provisions thereof and of applicable Law.

1.6. _Bylaws_. The bylaws, as amended, of Acquiror, as in effect as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Company until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof, of
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company and of applicable
Law.

1.7. _Directors of the Surviving Company_. The directors of Acquiror
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Company as of the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company,
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed (as the case
may be) and qualified.

1.8. _Officers of the Surviving Company_. The officers of Acquiror immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company as
of the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company, until their respective
successors are duly appointed, or their earlier death, resignation or
removal.

ARTICLE II

CONSIDERATION

2.1. _Effect on Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
common stock, par value $0.50 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common
Stock_ "):

(a) All shares of Company Common Stock that are (i) owned directly by the
Company as treasury stock or (ii) owned directly by Acquiror (other than, in
the case of clause (ii), shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the
like for the benefit of customers or shares held in satisfaction of a debt
previously contracted) shall be cancelled and retired and no shares of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Acquiror (" _Acquiror Common Stock_ "),
cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.



 

\- 2 - (b) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.1(a)_, and subject to 
_Section 2.2_, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive (i) one (1.0) share of Acquiror Common Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_
") plus (ii) $11.27 in cash. For the purposes of this Agreement, the " _Merger
Consideration_ " means the right to receive the consideration described in the
preceding sentence pursuant to the Merger with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares as
specified in _Section 2.2_).

2.2. _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of Acquiror
Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Company Common
Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of
Acquiror Common Stock shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in
an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all shares
of Company Common Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time to be
converted into Acquiror Common Stock) by the closing price of Acquiror Common
Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (" _NASDAQ_ ") as reported on the
NASDAQ website (or such other source as may be mutually agreed to by Acquiror
and the Company) (such conversion rate, the " _Conversion Rate_ "), on the
last trading day immediately preceding the Closing Date. No such holder shall
be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any
fractional share.

2.3. _Acquiror Common Stock; Acquiror Preferred Stock_. At and after the
Effective Time, each share of Acquiror Common Stock and each share of
preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Acquiror (the " _Acquiror
Preferred Stock_ "), if any, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of Acquiror Common
Stock or Acquiror Preferred Stock, as the case may be, and shall not be
affected by the Merger.

2.4. _Treatment of Options and Other Stock Based Awards_. (a) Each option
to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") issued
pursuant to any Company Stock Incentive Plan (as defined in _Section 2.4(c)_)
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not vested and exercisable, shall become fully vested and
exercisable immediately prior to, and shall be cancelled at, the Effective
Time, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive from Acquiror an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Per
Share Amount over (y) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option, with the aggregate amount payable rounded up
to the nearest cent, and (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, less any required withholding taxes (the " _Option
Consideration_ "). The Option Consideration shall be paid in a lump sum as
soon as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days following the Effective Time. For purposes of this
Agreement, the " _Per_ __  



 

\- 3 -   __ _Share Amount_ " shall mean $11.27 plus the product of (A) the Exchange
Ratio and (B) the volume weighted average of the per share prices of Acquiror
Common Stock on the NASDAQ for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending
two (2) days prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Each right to receive one share of Company Common Stock granted by the
Company under any Company Stock Incentive Plan in the form of "stock units" or
"restricted stock" (an " _RSU_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, become a vested right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the provisions of _Section
2.1(b)_, as if the holder of any such RSU were, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a holder of Company Common Stock.

(c) The 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, the Amended and Restated 2001 Management
Incentive Plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and the Amended
and Restated 1998 Stock Option/Restricted Stock Plan (collectively, the "
_Company Stock Incentive Plans_ ") and any other plan, program or arrangement
providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the
capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary (as defined in _Section
4.1(b)_) thereof shall terminate as of the Effective Time, and the Company
shall ensure that following the Effective Time no holder of any equity-based
right shall have any right to acquire equity securities of the Company or the
Surviving Company.

2.5. _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure_. Acquiror may at any time
change the method of effecting the business combination contemplated by this
Agreement if and to the extent that it deems such a change to be desirable;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such change shall (A) alter or change the
amount or kind of the consideration to be issued to holders of Company Common
Stock, Company Options or RSUs as merger consideration, (B) materially impede
or delay consummation of the business combination contemplated by this
Agreement or (C) adversely affect the federal income tax treatment of holders
of Company Common Stock, Company Options or RSUs in connection with the
business combination contemplated by this Agreement. In the event Acquiror
elects to make such a change, the parties agree to execute appropriate
documents to reflect the change.

2.6. _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent (as defined in _Section
3.1_), Acquiror or any of Acquirors Subsidiaries shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such
payment under all applicable Tax (as defined in  _Section 4.10(n)_) Laws. To
the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
recipient of the payment in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

2.7. _Certain Adjustments_. The Exchange Ratio shall be subject to appropriate
adjustments from time to time after the date of this Agreement in the event
that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective
Time, the outstanding Acquiror Common Stock shall have been increased,
decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares
or securities through any reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other like changes in
Acquirors capitalization.



 

\- 4 - ARTICLE III

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES FOR MERGER CONSIDERATION

3.1. _Acquiror to Make Merger Consideration Available_. At or promptly after
the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with an exchange agent selected by Acquiror (subject to the consent, not to be
unreasonably withheld, of the Company) (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of (a) certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") and (b) evidence of shares in book-entry form that immediately prior to
the Effective Time evidenced shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article III_ , (i) certificates or, at Acquirors
option, evidence of shares of Acquiror Common Stock in book-entry form
issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and (ii) cash sufficient to make the
payments under _Sections 2.1_ and _2.2_. With respect to any cash deposited by
Acquiror with the Exchange Agent as described in the immediately preceding
sentence, the Exchange Agent shall invest such cash in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Acquiror; _provided_ that during the first nine (9) months after
the Effective Time such investments shall consist solely of (i) obligations
of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or
instrumentality thereof, (ii) money market accounts, certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of inbound deposits with
commercial banks having a combined capital and surplus of at least $500
million, (iii) commercial paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better by
Standard and Poors or Moodys or (iv) institutional cash management funds.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
and be income of Acquiror. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Exchange
Fund_ " shall mean all Acquiror Common Stock and cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 3.1_. In the event that there is
insufficient cash in the Exchange Fund at any time during the first nine (9)
months after the Effective Time to enable the Exchange Agent to make the
payments under _Sections 2.1_ and _2.2_ , Acquiror shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the Exchange Agent the amount necessary to cause there to
be sufficient cash in the Exchange Fund to make such payments.

3.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of
a Certificate immediately prior to the Effective Time whose shares of Company
Common Stock were converted into the right to receive shares of Acquiror
Common Stock pursuant to  _Section 2.1_ a customary form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) containing instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
by such Certificate and such Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of
the Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the
Certificates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any holder of Company Common Stock that holds such shares in book-
entry form (rather than through a Certificate) shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent in order to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Article II_.



 

\- 5 - (b) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Acquiror Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to shares of Acquiror Common Stock
that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such
Certificate and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.2_ until such holder shall surrender
such Certificate in accordance with this _Article III_. After the surrender of
a Certificate in accordance with this  _Article III_ , such holder thereof
entitled to receive shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest
thereon, with a record date after the Effective Time and which theretofore
had become payable with respect to whole Acquiror Common Stock issuable to
such holder in respect of such Certificate.

(c) If the payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate
instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that
the person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance
any applicable stock transfer or other Taxes or shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid
or are not payable.

(d) At and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration as provided in this _Article III_.

(e) Any portion of the property deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 3.1_ that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for
nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be paid, at the request of
Acquiror, to or as directed by Acquiror. Any stockholders of the Company who
have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_  shall thereafter look
only to Acquiror for payment of the Merger Consideration (including cash in
lieu of fractional shares) and unpaid dividends and distributions on the
Acquiror Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Company
Common Stock held by such stockholder at the Effective Time as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of Acquiror,
the Company, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Acquiror, the
posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Acquiror or one of its
Subsidiaries may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this Agreement.



 

\- 6 - ARTICLE IV

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Acquiror that, (i) except as
set forth on the Company Disclosure Letter delivered by the Company to
Acquiror prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Letter_ "), it being understood and agreed that each item in a particular
section of the Company Disclosure Letter applies only to such section and to
any other section to which its relevance is reasonably apparent and (ii) other
than with respect to _Sections 4.2_ , _4.5(a)_ ,  _4.6(a)_ and _4.8(a)_ ,
except as disclosed in the Company Reports (as defined in _Section 4.5(a)_)
filed prior to the date of this Agreement and on or after August 1, 2008
(excluding any disclosures set forth in any "risk factor" section thereof or
under the heading "Forward-Looking Statements" in any such filings):

4.1. _Corporate Organization_. (a) The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Nevada. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease or operate all of its properties, rights and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties, rights and assets owned,
leased or operated by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this Agreement, the term "
_Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to the Company or Acquiror, as
the case may be, any fact, circumstance, event, change, effect, development
or occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate with all other facts,
circumstances, events, changes, effects, developments or occurrences, (x) has
a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial
condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (y) that
prevents such partys ability to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby no later than the End Date (as defined in  _Section 9.1(c)_);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect
has occurred pursuant to clause (x) above and, with respect to clause (ii)
below only, clause (y) above, there shall be excluded any effect on the
referenced party the cause of which is (i) any change after the date of this
Agreement in Laws, rules or regulations of general applicability or in United
States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or regulatory
accounting requirements, (ii) the announcement of this Agreement, any action
of any party to this Agreement or any of its Subsidiaries expressly required
to be taken by it under this Agreement or any action or omission of any party
to this Agreement or any of its Subsidiaries taken with the prior written
consent of the other party to this Agreement, (iii) any changes or
developments after the date of this Agreement in general economic, business
or financial conditions in the United States (including changes in interest
rates, credit availability and price levels or trading volumes in securities
markets), _provided_ , that the effect of such changes or developments
described in this clause (iii) (including changes in interest rates, credit
availability and price levels or trading volumes in securities markets) shall
not be excluded to the extent of the disproportionate impact, if any, they
have on such party and its Subsidiaries (relative to other participants in
the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate), and
_provided_ , _further_ , that a decrease in the trading or market prices of a
partys capital stock or failure to meet projections shall not be considered,
by itself, to constitute a Material Adverse Effect (it being understood and
agreed that the facts and circumstances giving rise to such decrease or
failure 



 

\- 7 -  may be taken into account in determining whether there has been a Material
Adverse Effect), and (iv) changes in national or international political
conditions including the engagement by the United States in hostilities,
whether or not pursuant to the declaration of a national emergency or war, or
the occurrence of any military or terrorist attack upon or within the United
States, or any of its territories, possessions, diplomatic or consular
offices or upon any military installation, equipment or personnel of the
United States, _provided_ , that the effect of such changes described in this
clause (iv) shall not be excluded to the extent of the disproportionate
impact, if any, they have on such party and its Subsidiaries (relative to
other participants in the industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries
operate). The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, copies of
which have been made available to Acquiror, are true, complete and correct
copies of such documents as in full force and effect as of the date of this
Agreement.

(b) Section 4.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date

duly organized and validly existing as a corporation, partnership or other
entity and is in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is in good
standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or foreign) where
its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires
it to be so licensed or qualified and (iii) has all requisite corporate or
other power and authority to own or lease its properties, rights and assets
and to carry on its business as now conducted, except, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii), where the failure to be so licensed or qualified to

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect to any
person, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company
or any other entity (i) of which such person or a subsidiary of such person is
a general partner or (ii) at least a majority of the securities or other

outstanding and no shares of Company Preferred Stock outstanding. As of the
close of business on the Capitalization Date, 1,695,593 shares of Company

the exercise of Company Options pursuant to the Company Stock 



 

\- 8 -  Incentive Plans and (ii) an aggregate of 272,084 shares of Company Common
Stock reserved for issuance upon the vesting of any RSU. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. No
Subsidiary of the Company owns any shares of Company Common Stock (other than
shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like for the benefit of

or equity securities of the Company or any other securities of the Company
other than issuances of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the

stock-based performance units or other similar rights, agreements
or commitments of any character relating to the purchase or issuance of any
shares of the capital stock of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries or
other equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares
of the capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any
rights plan or agreement) or equity-based awards, nor is there any other
agreement to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party

sell any shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or securities convertible into or exchangeable for

Subsidiaries has any other trust capital securities or other similar
securities outstanding.

all other equity or equity-based awards relating to Company Common Stock, the
names of the optionees or grantees thereof, identification of any such
optionees or grantees that are not current or former employees, directors or
officers of the Company, the date each such Company Option or other award was
granted, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such
Company Option or underlying each such other award, the expiration date of
each such Company Option or other award, any vesting schedule with respect to
a Company Option which is not yet fully vested and the date on which each
other award is scheduled to be settled or become free of restrictions, the
price at which each such Company Option may be exercised (or base price with
respect to stock appreciation rights, if any) and the closing price of one
share of Company Common Stock on the date of grant of each of the foregoing.
The exercise price per share of each Company Option was, on the applicable
date of grant of the Company Option, no less than the fair market value of one
share of Company Common Stock on such grant date.



 

\- 9 - (c) Section 4.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists the name,
jurisdiction of incorporation, authorized and outstanding shares of capital
stock or other equity interests and record and beneficial owners of such
capital stock or other equity interests for each Subsidiary. The Company owns,
directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of or all other equity interests in each of the Companys Subsidiaries,
free and clear of any liens, pledges, charges, encumbrances, adverse rights or
claims and security interests whatsoever (" _Liens_ "), and all of such

applications, notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as
practicable all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Entities which are necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the

consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties and
Governmental Entities, including by filing a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act, and supplying as promptly as reasonably practicable
any additional information and documents requested pursuant to the HSR Act.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall have the right to review in

(d) Acquiror and the Company shall promptly advise each other upon receiving

7.2. _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall,

the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as

obtaining the Required Company Vote and, subject to _Section 7.3(b)_, shall
take all lawful action to solicit the approval of this Agreement by
such stockholders. The board of directors of the Company shall recommend
approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company (the " _Company
Recommendation_ ") in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall not directly or
indirectly (x) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Acquiror
such recommendation or (y) take any other action or make any other public
statement in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting, or in reference
to an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in _Section 7.4(b)_), that is
inconsistent with such recommendation (any action or public statement
described in clause (x) or (y) being referred to as a " _Change in Company
Recommendation_ "), except as and to the extent expressly permitted by
_Section 7.3(b)_ or _7.4(a)_.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the date of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, the Company and its board of directors shall be
permitted to effect a Change in Company Recommendation if and only to the
extent that:

(i) it has complied in all material respects with _Section 7.4_,

(ii) its board of directors, based on the advice of its outside counsel,
determines in good faith that it is required to take such action in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and

(iii) if the Companys board of directors intends to effect a Change in
Company Recommendation following an Acquisition Proposal, (A) such Acquisition
Proposal was unsolicited and the Companys board of directors has concluded in
good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (as
defined in _Section 7.4(c)_) after giving effect to all of the adjustments
which may be offered by Acquiror pursuant to clause (C) below, (B) the Company
has notified Acquiror in writing, at least five (5) Business Days in advance,
of its intention to effect a Change in Company Recommendation (the " _Notice
Period_ "), specifying the material terms and conditions of any such Superior
Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal)
and furnishing to Acquiror a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and all other material
documents and (C) during the Notice Period, and in any event, prior to
effecting such a Change in Company Recommendation, the Company has negotiated,
and has caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, with Acquiror in
good faith (to the extent Acquiror desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.



 

\- 39 - In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Acquiror and to again
comply with the requirements of this _Section 7.3(b) _with respect to such
new written notice, except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to three
(3) Business Days.

7.4. _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) From the date hereof until the Effective
Time or, if earlier, the date on which this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Article IX_ , the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents and representatives (including any investment bankers, attorneys
or accountants retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate
(including by way of providing information) the submission of any inquiries,
proposals or offers (whether firm or hypothetical) that constitute or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) have any
discussions with or provide any confidential information or data to any person
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning
an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iv) approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger
agreement, asset or share purchase or share exchange agreement, option
agreement or other similar agreement related to any Acquisition Proposal, (v)
enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring, directly or
indirectly, the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder, or (vi)
propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 7.4(a)_, in the event that the Company receives
an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal and the Companys
board of directors concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal, the
Company may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and their officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives to, prior to (but not after)
the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, (A) take any action described in
clause (ii) above and (B) to the extent permitted by and in compliance
with Section 9.1(h), authorize the execution of a definitive agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal, in each case to the extent that its board of
directors concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside
counsel) that it is required to take such actions in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to
providing (or causing to be provided) any confidential information or data
permitted to be provided pursuant to this sentence, the Company shall have
entered into a written confidentiality agreement with such third party on
terms no less favorable to the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall promptly provide Acquiror
with any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
provided to such person which was not previously provided to Acquiror (or its
representatives).

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person (other than Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries) relating to any direct or indirect (i) acquisition, purchase or

Subsidiaries) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, or (iii) purchase 



 

\- 40 -  or sale of, or tender or exchange offer (including a self-tender offer) for,
securities of the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries that, if
consummated, would result in any person (or the stockholders of such person)
beneficially owning securities representing 20% or more of the equity or total
voting power of the Company, any of its Significant Subsidiaries or the
surviving parent entity in such transaction.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal to acquire, directly or indirectly, a
majority of the total voting power of the Company (or a majority of the total
voting power of the resulting or surviving entity of such transaction or the
ultimate parent of such resulting or surviving entity), which the board of
directors of the Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and receiving the advice of its outside counsel, taking
into account timing and all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of
the proposal and the person making the proposal (including any break-up fees,
expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation), (i) is more
favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) is reasonably
capable of being consummated on the terms proposed.

(d) The Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any persons other than Acquiror with respect to any Acquisition

agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, including by requiring the
other parties thereto to promptly return or destroy any confidential
information previously furnished by or on behalf of the Company thereunder.
The Company will promptly (and in all events within 24 hours) following
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal advise Acquiror of the
material terms thereof (including the identity of the person making such
Acquisition Proposal), and will keep Acquiror apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations and the status and terms thereof
(including providing Acquiror with a copy of all material documentation and
correspondence relating thereto) on a reasonably current basis. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall notify Acquiror orally and in
writing within 24 hours after it enters into discussions or negotiations with
another person regarding an Acquisition Proposal, executes and delivers a
confidentiality agreement with another person in connection with
an Acquisition Proposal, or provides non-public information or data to
another person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its board
of directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)(2)-(3)
promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; 
_provided_ , that such Rules will in no way eliminate or modify the effect
that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under this
Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that any such disclosure (other than a
"stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change in
Company Recommendation unless the board of directors of the Company expressly
and concurrently reaffirms the Company Recommendation.



 

\- 41 - 7.5. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each of Acquiror and the Company shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply
promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party or
its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger, to satisfy the conditions set
forth in _Article VIII_ hereof and, subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ hereof, consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) to obtain (and to cooperate with the
other party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or
any exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party which is
required to be obtained by the Company or Acquiror or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Acquiror
and the Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby,
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) modify or amend any contracts,
plans or arrangements to which Acquiror or the Company is a party (to the
extent permitted by the terms thereof) if necessary in order to satisfy the
conditions to closing set forth in _Article VIII_ hereof, (ii) lift or
rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting
the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and (iii) defend any litigation seeking to enjoin, prevent or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeking material
damages.

7.6. _Employees; Employee Benefit Plans_.

(a) On or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, the Company
Employees who are employees of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company at
the Effective Time shall become eligible to participate in the employee
benefit plans sponsored or maintained by Acquiror or Peoples United Bank,
as applicable (the " _Acquiror Plans_ "), to the same extent and on the same
terms (or, on more favorable terms) as similarly situated employees of
Peoples United Bank (it being understood that inclusion of Company Employees
in such Acquiror Plans may occur at different times with respect to different
plans). Until such time, such Company Employees shall continue to participate
in the Plans (excluding equity-based Plans and any Company Common Stock fund
feature of the Companys 401(k) Plan) in which each such Company Employee
participated before the Effective Time on the same (or more favorable) terms
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_
, that (i) nothing contained herein shall require Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries to make any grants to any Company Employee under any equity-based
Acquiror Plans, it being understood that any such grants are completely
discretionary and (ii) nothing contained herein shall require a Company
Employees participation in any Acquiror Plan that is a defined benefit
pension plan.

(b) With respect to each Acquiror Plan, for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, vesting, entitlement to benefits and vacation
entitlement (but not for accrual of benefits under any post-retirement
welfare benefit Acquiror Plan), service with the Company or any Subsidiary
shall be treated as service with Acquiror; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits. Such service also shall apply for
purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence 



 

\- 42 -  of insurability requirements, or the application of any pre-existing
condition limitations with respect to any Acquiror Plan. Each Acquiror Plan
shall waive pre-existing condition limitations to the same extent waived
under the applicable Plan. The Company Employees shall be given credit for
amounts paid under a corresponding Company or any Subsidiary benefit plan
during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments, out-of-pocket maximums and similar payments as though such amounts
had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Acquiror Plan
during the applicable plan year.

(c) The Company and Acquiror acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained herein with respect to employees, officers, directors, consultants
and independent contractors are included for the sole benefit of the Company
and Acquiror and shall not create any right (i) in any other person, including
Plans or any beneficiary thereof or (ii) to continued employment
with Acquiror or any of its affiliates.

7.7. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) From and
after the Effective Time, in the event of any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, in which any
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is,
or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is
or was a director or officer of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement, or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and all actions taken by an Indemnified
Party in connection herewith, in each case in his or her capacity as a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether in any
case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall
cause the Surviving Company to indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the
fullest extent provided in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement and permitted by applicable
Law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party upon receipt of an undertaking, from
such Indemnified Party to repay such advanced expenses if it is determined by
a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that
such Indemnified Party was not entitled to indemnification hereunder),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative. Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section 7.7_, upon learning of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly
notify Acquiror in writing thereof, _provided_ , that the failure to so
notify shall not affect the obligations of Acquiror under this _Section 7.7_
except (and only) to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices
Acquiror.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall
cause the persons serving as officers and directors of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered by the directors and
officers liability insurance policy or policies maintained by Acquiror or one
of its Subsidiaries ( _provided_ , that Acquirors directors and officers
liability insurance policy or policies provide at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, not
materially less advantageous to such directors and officers of the Company
than the terms and conditions of the existing 



 

\- 43 -  directors and officers liability insurance policy of the Company) with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that existed or occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will
Acquiror be required to expend, in the aggregate and on an annual basis, an
amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company
for such insurance, which current premiums are set forth in Section 7.7(b) of
the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Insurance Amount_ "), and if Acquiror is
unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this _Section
7.7(b)_ for an amount per year equal to or less than the Insurance Amount,
Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain as much comparable
insurance as may be available for the Insurance Amount. The provisions of this
_Section 7.7(b)_ shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies
have been obtained by Acquiror or by the Company with Acquirors consent,
which policies provide the persons covered by the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance policy immediately prior to the Effective Time
with coverage for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective
Time with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that such prepaid policies shall
not be obtained at an annual cost that is higher than the Insurance Amount. If
such prepaid policies have been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective
Time with Acquirors consent, Acquiror shall maintain such policies in full
force and effect and continue to honor all obligations thereunder.

(c) The provisions of this  _Section 7.7_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs
and representatives, and shall be in addition to any other rights each
Indemnified Party may have pursuant to law, contract, or otherwise.

(d) If Acquiror, the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Acquiror
or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 7.7_. 

7.8. _Advice of Changes_. Acquiror and the Company shall promptly advise the
other of any change or event which, individually or in the aggregate with
other such changes or events, has or would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on it or which it believes would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any noncompliance with the foregoing shall not constitute the
failure to be satisfied of a condition set forth in _Article VIII_ or
give rise to any right of termination under _Article IX_ unless the
underlying breach shall independently constitute such a failure or give rise
to such a right.

7.9. _Financial Statements and Other Current Information_. The Company shall
(a) furnish to Acquiror consolidated and consolidating income statements and
balance sheets in accordance with currently available information and
practice (it being understood that the Company and its Subsidiaries do not
currently close their books on a monthly basis), in each case, as soon as
reasonably practicable after they become available, but in no event more than
30 days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date of this
Agreement, (b) use its reasonable best efforts to develop a process by the
Effective Time for preparing monthly 



 

\- 44 -  consolidated and consolidating financial statements (including balance
sheets, statements of operations and stockholders equity) of the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries as of and for such month then ended and (c) to the
extent the financial statements described in clause (b) become available after
the date of this Agreement, furnish such financial statements to Acquiror as
they become available. In addition, and to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, the Company shall furnish Acquiror with a copy of each report filed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with a Governmental Entity within three
(3) Business Days following the filing thereof. All information furnished by
the Company to Acquiror pursuant to this _Section 7.9_ shall be held in
confidence to the same extent of Acquirors obligations under _Section
7.2(b)_.

7.10. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Acquiror shall notify NASDAQ of the listing on
NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, of the Acquiror Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger.

7.11. _Takeover Laws_. The Company shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to
ensure that no state takeover Law or similar Law or any takeover-related
provision in the Companys articles of incorporation or bylaws is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover
Law or similar Law or any takeover-related provision in the Companys articles
of incorporation or bylaws becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use reasonable
best efforts with respect to such Laws or provisions to ensure that the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

7.12. _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Acquiror the
opportunity to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of
any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without Acquirors prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

7.13. _Exemption from Liability_. Assuming that the Company delivers
to Acquiror the Section 16 Information reasonably in advance of the Effective
Time, the board of directors of Acquiror, or a committee of Non-Employee
Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under
the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly thereafter and in any event
prior to the Effective Time adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by
the Company Insiders of Acquiror Common Stock (including any securities
convertible into or exercisable for, or any rights, warrants or options to
acquire Acquiror Common Stock) in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock
(including any securities convertible into or exercisable for, or any rights,
warrants or options to acquire Company Common Stock) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed
in the Section 16 Information provided by the Company to Acquiror prior to the
Effective Time, are intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section
16(b) under the Exchange Act such that any such receipt shall be so exempt. "
_Section 16 Information_ " shall mean information accurate in all respects
regarding the Company Insiders, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
held by each such Company Insider and the number and description of the
derivative securities held by each such Company Insider. " _Company Insiders_
" shall mean those officers 



 

\- 45 -  and directors of the Company who are subject to the reporting requirements
of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are listed in the Section 16
Information.

7.14. _Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment_. The parties to this Agreement
intend that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)
of the Code and each shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective
affiliates to, take any action, or fail to take any action, that would
reasonably be expected to jeopardize the qualifications of the Merger as
a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties to this
Agreement shall use their reasonable best efforts to deliver the
representation letters referred to in Sections 8.2(c) and 8.3(c) hereof.

7.15. _Offer Letters_. On or prior to the earlier of (a) ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date and (b) the date on which this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with _Article IX_ , Acquiror shall not revoke or modify the

and such denial has become final and nonappealable or (ii) any Governmental
Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final nonappealable order
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

(c) by either Acquiror or the Company if the Effective Time shall not
have occurred on or before June 30, 2010 (the " _End Date_ "), unless the

the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein;

(d) by either Acquiror or the Company ( _provided_ , that the terminating
party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or other agreement contained herein) if the other party shall have breached

herein, and in either case, such breach (x) is not cured within 30 days

under _Article VIII_ hereof;

(e) by either Acquiror or the Company if the Required Company Vote shall not
have been obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting or at any adjournment
or postponement thereof;

business day period specified in Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act; or

(h) by the Company in order to enter into a transaction that is a Superior
Proposal, if, prior to the receipt of the Required Company Vote, the
Companys board of directors authorizes the Company, subject to complying with
the terms of this Agreement, to enter into a definitive agreement with respect
to a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal and (A) such Acquisition Proposal was
not solicited in violation of _Section 7.4_ and the Companys board of

punitive damages. For purposes of this Agreement, " _willful and material
breach_ " shall mean a material breach that is a consequence of an act
undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge (actual or constructive)
that the taking of such act would, or would be reasonably expected to, cause
a breach of this Agreement.

(b) The Company shall pay Acquiror (as consideration for termination
of Acquirors rights under this Agreement), by wire transfer of immediately

Company contemplated by this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting
having occurred, and in any such case an Acquisition Proposal with respect to
the Company shall have been publicly announced or otherwise communicated or
made known to the senior management or board of directors of the Company (or
any person shall have publicly announced, communicated or made publicly known
an intention, whether or not conditional, to make an Acquisition Proposal) at
any time after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to the date of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, in the case of clause (B), or the date of
termination, in the case of clauses (A) or (C), then the Company shall pay to
Acquiror (x) an amount equal to 10% of the Termination Payment on the second
Business Day following such termination, and (y) if within 12 months after
such termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates a transaction
contemplated by, any Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay the
remainder of the Termination Payment on the earlier of the date of such
execution or consummation, _provided_ , _however_ , that for the purpose of
this clause (y), all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to
"20% or more" shall instead refer to "50% or more".

(c) The Company and Acquiror agree that the agreements contained in _Section
9.2(b)_ are integral parts of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that such amounts do not constitute a penalty. If the Company fails to pay
Acquiror the amounts due under such _Section 9.2(b)_ within the time periods
specified in such section, the Company shall pay the costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by Acquiror 



 

\- 50 -  in connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit, taken to
collect payment of such amounts, together with interest on the amount of any
such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period
as published in the New York City edition of the _The Wall Street Journal_ ,
calculated on a daily basis from the date such amounts were required to be
paid until the date of actual payment.

9.3. _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement
may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective boards of directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any such approval, no amendment
shall be made which by Law requires further approval by such stockholders
without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

9.4. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such
party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance
with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and Section
references are to this Agreement unless otherwise specified. Whenever the

\- 52 -  Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The term " _person_ " as used in this Agreement shall mean any

partnership, joint venture, government or any agency or political subdivision
thereof, or any other entity or any group (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of

10.5. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile (or other
electronic means) and in counterparts, all of which shall be considered an
original and one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the
same counterpart.

10.6. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the documents and the
instruments referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than (i)
the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement to the extent provided in _Section 7.2(b)_, and (ii) the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated October 14, 2009, between the Company and
Acquiror, which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions thereof.

10.7. _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_. This
Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the Laws of the
State of Delaware (except to the extent that mandatory provisions of federal
Law or the NRS are applicable).

(a) Each of Acquiror and the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the United
States District Court for Delaware and in the courts hearing appeals therefrom
unless no basis for federal jurisdiction exists, in which event each party
hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any
state court of the State of Delaware, and the courts hearing appeals
therefrom, for any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Acquiror and
the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such
action, suit or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts for any reason, other than the failure
to serve process in accordance with this _Section 10.7_, that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, that the action, suit or proceeding in any such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such action, suit or
proceeding is improper, or that this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts and further irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent 



 

\- 53 -  permitted by applicable Law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder,
fetter or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which the
party is entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having
jurisdiction. Each of Acquiror and the Company irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all rights
to trial by jury in connection with any action, suit or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Each of Acquiror and the Company further irrevocably consents to the
service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any action, suit
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement by the mailing of
copies thereof by registered mail, postage prepaid, to such party at its
address specified pursuant to _Section 10.3_, such service of process to be
effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered mail.

(c) Each of Acquiror and the Company expressly acknowledges that the foregoing
waivers are intended to be irrevocable under the laws of the State of
Delaware and of the United States of America; _provided_ , that consent by
Acquiror and the Company to jurisdiction and service contained in this
_Section 10.7_ is solely for the purpose referred to in this  _Section
10.7_ and shall not be deemed to be a general submission to said courts or in
the State of Delaware other than for such purpose.

10.8. _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid, illegal or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions
of this Agreement or affecting the validity, legality or enforceability of
any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction,
and if any provision of this Agreement is determined to be so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable, in all cases so long as neither the economic nor legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party or its stockholders. Upon any such determination, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon a suitable
and equitable substitute provision to effect the original intent of the
parties.

10.9.  _Publicity_. Acquiror and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or making any public statement with respect
to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby
and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent
of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable
in the circumstances) issue such press release or make such public statement
as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by Law or the rules and
regulations of the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ, as the case may be.
Without limiting the preceding sentence, Acquiror and the Company shall
cooperate to develop all public announcement materials and make appropriate
management available at presentations related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as reasonably requested by the
other party. In addition, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall (a) consult
with Acquiror regarding communications with customers, stockholders,
prospective investors and employees related to the transactions contemplated
hereby, (b) provide Acquiror with stockholder lists of the Company from time
to time as requested by Acquiror and (c) allow and facilitate Acquiror contact
with stockholders of the Company and other prospective investors.



 

\- 54 - 10.10. _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations of any party hereunder shall be
assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in  _Section 7.7_ hereof,
this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is
not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder.

10.11. _Construction_. This Agreement and any documents or instruments
delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall be construed
without regard to the identity of the person who drafted the various
provisions of the same. Each and every provision of this Agreement and such
other documents and instruments shall be construed as though all of the
parties participated equally in the drafting of the same. Consequently, the
parties acknowledge and agree that any rule of construction that a document is
to be construed against the drafting party shall not be applicable either to
this Agreement or such other documents and instruments.

10.12. _Specific Performance_. Each of Acquiror and the Company agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their terms on a timely basis or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that Acquiror and the Company
shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof
in any court identified in _Section 10.7(a)_ without having to post any bond
or other security or undertaking, in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of Acquiror and the Company agree
that the harm to the party seeking such injunction or other equitable relief
would, were the injunction not to issue or equitable relief not be granted,
outweigh the harm to the party seeking to avoid the injunction or equitable
relief, were such injunction to issue or equitable relief be granted. In any
proceeding between the parties hereto regarding any such breach, neither
Acquiror nor the Company shall take any position inconsistent with the
matters set forth in this _Section 10.12_. Each of Acquiror and the Company
agree that the agreements contained in this _Section 10.12_ are in integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without
these agreements, neither party would have entered into this Agreement.
