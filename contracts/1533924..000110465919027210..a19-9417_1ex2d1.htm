Parent

 



     

 

 



 

Common Stock and cash amounts, together with any dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), _provided_ that
no such deposits shall be required to be made with respect to any Cancelled
Shares or Appraisal Shares. The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions from Parent, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be
issued in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this
Agreement, together with any amounts payable pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_, if
applicable, out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement. Except
as contemplated by this _Section 3.3(a)_, the Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose. The Surviving Entity shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the
exchange of shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration. Any
interest or other income resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall
become part of the Exchange Fund.

 



 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no
event more than three (3) Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each record holder (other than record
holders of Cancelled Shares or Appraisal Shares), as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, of (A) an outstanding certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common
Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") or (B) shares of Company Common Stock that were
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") a letter of transmittal ("
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the Letter of
Transmittal, and which shall be in a customary form and agreed to by Parent
and the Company prior to the Closing) and instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the
surrender of such shares, for payment of the Merger Consideration, together
with any amounts payable pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_, if applicable.

 



 

(ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, delivery of a duly completed and validly executed Letter of
Transmittal, and such other customary documents as may be reasonably required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to promptly receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
_Article III_, together with any amounts payable pursuant to _Section
3.3(g)_, if applicable, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and all Certificates so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued
for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry

 



     

 

 



 

Shares on the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the record holder of such shares of Company Common Stock, it
shall be a condition of payment that shares so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of such shares surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Entity that such Taxes either have been paid
or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
3.3(b)(ii)_, each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of
Company Common Stock, together with any amounts payable to such holder
pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_, if applicable.

 



 

(c) _Termination Rights_. All Merger Consideration, together with any amounts
payable pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_, if applicable, paid upon the surrender
of and in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Entity shall be closed immediately, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Entity of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Entity
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares evidencing shares of Company Common Stock
described in clause (iii) of _Section 3.1(b)_) without any interest thereon.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the former stockholders of the Company on the date
that is 12 months after the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent, upon
Parents demand, and any former common stockholders of the Company who have
not received the Merger Consideration, together with any amounts payable
pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_, if applicable, in each case without interest
thereon prior to such delivery, shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of their claim for such amounts.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Entity, Parent, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of Company Common Stock for any
amount of Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or similar Law.
If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share has not been surrendered prior to the
time that is immediately prior to the time at which Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such shares, cash,
dividends or distributions in respect

 



     

 

 



 

of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate (other than
a Certificate evidencing shares of Company Common Stock described in clause
(iii) of _Section 3.1(b)_) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Parent or the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Entity may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate,
together with any amounts payable pursuant to _Section 3.3(g)_, if
applicable.

 



 

(g) _Distributions with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the whole shares
of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares until such holder shall
surrender such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this
_Section 3.3_. Following surrender of any such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares, there shall be paid to such holder of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the
time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares
of Parent Common Stock, all whole shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
were issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(h) _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent, Merger Sub, LLC Sub, the Company, the Surviving Entity and the
Exchange Agent and each of their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to
deduct or withhold (or cause to be deducted or withheld) from any amounts or
securities otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts or
securities as are required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the
making of such payments under applicable Law. To the extent that any such
amounts or securities are so deducted or withheld and timely paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts or
securities shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 



 

(i) _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip or shares representing
fractional Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this

 



     

 

 



 

Agreement, all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that a holder of
shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger would
otherwise be entitled to receive as Merger Consideration (after taking into
account all Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and
Book-Entry Shares) will be aggregated and then, if a fractional share of
Parent Common Stock results from that aggregation, be rounded up to the
nearest share of Parent Common Stock, as applicable.

 



 

 **3.4** **_Appraisal Rights_**. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who has
not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto and properly exercises
and perfects appraisal rights in respect of such shares pursuant to, and in
accordance with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)(i)_, but instead at the
Effective Time shall be entitled to only those rights as are granted by
Section 262 of the DGCL, and at the Effective Time all Appraisal Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to
exist. If any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not
entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then such shares
of Company Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Appraisal Shares
and shall thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to have become,
as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest thereon, the
Merger Consideration. The Company shall deliver prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock and the Company
shall provide Parent with the opportunity to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL.

materially affect the value of such property and do not materially interfere
with the use made and proposed to be made of such property by the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) for Company Permitted Liens or (iii) such as
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, "

that a prudent

 



     

 

 



 

person engaged in the business of purchasing and owning, developing and
operating producing or non-producing Oil and Gas Properties in the
geographical areas in which they are located, with knowledge of all of the
facts and their legal bearing, would be willing to accept, acting reasonably.

 



 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the Company, there
is no default under any Oil and Gas Lease by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or any other party thereto, and no event has occurred that with the
lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default
thereunder by the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any other party
thereto, in each case except as would not reasonably be expected, individually
or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably

the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2018 (the " _Company Reserve Report_ ") was accurate in all material
respects at the time of preparation of the Company Reserve Report. With
respect to the proved reserves reflected in the Company Reserve Report, the
Company Reserve Report conforms in all material respects to the guidelines
with respect thereto of the SEC. Except for changes (including changes in
Hydrocarbon commodity prices) generally affecting the oil and gas industry and
normal depletion by production, there has been no change in respect of the
matters addressed in the Company Reserve Report that would reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(h) Parent does not have any obligation to "gross-up" or otherwise indemnify
any individual for the imposition of the excise tax under Section 4999 of the

(i) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation
of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby (alone or in
conjunction with any other event, including any termination of employment on
or following the Effective Time) will, after giving effect to _Section 3.2_
of this Agreement, (i) entitle any current or former director, officer,
employee, contractor, consultant or other service provider of Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary to any material increase in compensation or benefits, (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding,

 **5.13** **_Title to Properties; Oil and Gas Properties_**.

 



 

(a) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have good and defensible title to all
real and personal properties that are material to the business of Parent and
the Parent Subsidiaries, including Oil and Gas Properties described in the
Parent Reserve Report, in each case free and clear of all Liens and defects
and imperfections of title except (i) such as do not materially affect the
value of such property and do not materially interfere with the use made and
proposed to be made of such property by Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries,
(ii) for Parent Permitted Liens or (iii) such as would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, " _good and defensible title_
" means title that is free from reasonable doubt that a prudent person engaged
in the business of purchasing and owning, developing and operating producing
or non-producing Oil and Gas Properties in the geographical areas in which
they are located, with knowledge of all of the facts and their legal bearing,
would be willing to accept, acting reasonably.

 



 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, there is no
default under any Oil and Gas Lease by Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or
any other party thereto, and no event has occurred that with the lapse of time
or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default thereunder by
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any other party thereto, in each case
except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, all royalties, overriding
royalties and similar burdens on Hydrocarbon production from Parents Oil and
Gas Properties payable by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to third parties
have been properly and timely paid or held in suspense funds.

 



 

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, there is no
outstanding authorization for expenditure or similar request or invoice for
funding or participation under any agreement or contract which is binding on
Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any Oil and Gas Property and which Parent
reasonably anticipates will individually require expenditures by Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary in excess of $1,000,000.

 



 

 **5.14** **_Reserve Report_**. The factual, non-interpretive data relating to
the Oil and Gas Properties of Parent on which the reserve report prepared by
Parent and audited by its independent

 



     

 

 



 

reserve engineers referred to in Parents Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (the " _Parent Reserve Report_ ") was
accurate in all material respects at the time of preparation of Parent Reserve
Report. With respect to the proved reserves reflected in the Parent Reserve
Report, the Parent Reserve Report conforms in all material respects to the
guidelines with respect thereto of the SEC. Except for changes (including
changes in Hydrocarbon commodity prices) generally affecting the oil and gas
industry and normal depletion by production, there has been no change in
respect of the matters addressed in the Parent Reserve Report that would
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **5.15** **_Material Contracts_**.

SEC Documents, Section 5.15(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a

(xi) any Contract to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party that is
for the employment or engagement of any person on a full-time or part-time
basis, including directors, employees and independent contractors and
employees at annual compensation in excess of $1,000,000.

 



 

Each such Contract described in clauses (i) through (xi) above is referred to
herein as a " _Parent_ _Specified Contract_."

Effect and (ii) insofar as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,

relating to or affecting creditors rights, or by principles governing the

Material Adverse Effect.

Agreement from a Governmental Entity that alleges that Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary is not in compliance with or is in default or violation of any

not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises,
tariffs, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances,

Permits would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All Parent Permits are in full force
and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the Parent
Permits is, to the Knowledge of Parent, pending or threatened, except where
such suspension or cancellation would not reasonably be expected, individually
or in the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **5.18** **_Environmental Matters_**. Except for matters that would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect:

 



 

(a) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are in compliance with all
Environmental Laws, including obtaining, maintaining and complying with all
Environmental Permits required for the operation of their businesses as they
are being conducted as of the date of this Agreement;

 



 

(b) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has received any written notice
since December 31, 2018 (or earlier if pending or unresolved) and prior to the

Subsidiaries as of the date hereof and Parent has provided the Company with
true and complete copies of all material agreements evidencing such
Indebtedness.

 



 

 **5.20** **_Material Customers and Material Suppliers_**.

 



 

(a) Section 5.20(a)(i) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth the top ten
(10) customers of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries collectively (based on
the dollar amount of revenue from such customers) for the 12-month period
ended December 31, 2018 (the " _Parent Material Customers_ "). Except as set
forth on Section 5.20(a)(ii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, no such Parent
Material Customer has, during the last 12 months, cancelled or terminated any
of its Contracts or arrangements or materially reduced its business in the
aggregate, with Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, made any threat to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to cancel or
otherwise terminate any of its Contracts or arrangements or materially reduce
its business in the aggregate with Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (other than
changes to pricing and quantity of products and services which are currently
permitted by the arrangements with such Parent Material Customer).

 



 

(b) Section 5.20(b)(i) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth the top ten
(10) suppliers of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries collectively (based on
the dollar amount of purchases from such suppliers) for the 12-month period

Material Supplier has, during the last 12 months, cancelled or terminated any
of its contracts or arrangements, or materially reduced its business in the
aggregate, with Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or, to the Knowledge of

_Intellectual Property_ ") free and clear of all Liens except for Parent
Permitted Liens, except where the failure

 



      

 

 



 

to own or have the right to use such Intellectual Property would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries, the use of the Parent Intellectual Property by Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries in the operation of the business of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries as presently conducted is not infringing upon or misappropriating
any Intellectual Property of any other Person, except for such matters that
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **5.22** **_Insurance_**. Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries maintain, or are
entitled to the benefits of, insurance in such amounts and against such risks
substantially as Parent believes to be customary for the industries in which
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries operate. Except as would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, (a) all material insurance policies maintained by or on behalf of
Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement are in full
force and effect, and all premiums due on such policies have been paid and (b)
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms and
provisions of all insurance policies maintained by or on behalf of Parent or
the Parent Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, and neither Parent
nor any Parent Subsidiary is in breach or default under, or has taken any
action that would permit termination or material modification of, any material
insurance policies.

each such term is defined in the U.S. Public Utility Holding Company Act of

petroleum product, crude oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas, natural gas
liquid and other pipelines, lateral lines, pumps, pump stations, storage
facilities, terminals, processing plants and other related operations, assets,
machinery or equipment that are subject to (x) regulation by the U.S. Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, as amended, or
(y) rate regulation or comprehensive nondiscriminatory access regulation under
the Laws of any state or other local jurisdiction.

 



 

 **5.24** **_Brokers and Other Advisors_**. No broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other Person, other than Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc.,

Parent Subsidiary or owns or has any interest in any of their respective
properties or assets, in each case as would be required to be disclosed by

Act.

indirectly, enter into any agreement with any Person which directly or

, _however_ , that (A) no non-public information that is prohibited from being
furnished pursuant to _Section 6.4(b)_ may be furnished until the Company
receives an executed confidentiality agreement from such Person (an accurate
and complete copy of which shall be provided to Parent substantially
concurrently with the Companys entry into such confidentiality agreement)
containing limitations on the use and disclosure of nonpublic information
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company that are no less
favorable to the Company in the aggregate than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that such confidentiality
agreement does not contain provisions that prohibit the Company from complying
with the provisions of this _Section 6.4_ (such agreement, a " _Company
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "), (B) the Company also provides
Parent, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time such non-public
information is provided or made available to such Person, any non-public
information furnished to such other Person that was not previously furnished
to Parent, and (C) prior to taking any such actions, the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and legal counsel, that such Company Alternative Proposal
is, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Superior Proposal
and, after consultation with its legal counsel, that the failure to engage in
such activities would be a breach of the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; and

 



 

(iii) prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to
the Companys receipt of a Company Alternative Proposal that did not result
from a breach of this _Section 6.4_, if the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) so chooses, cause the Company to effect a Company Change in
Recommendation, if prior to taking such action (A) the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and legal counsel, that such Company Alternative Proposal
is a Company Superior Proposal (taking into account any adjustment to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such
Company Alternative Proposal), (B) the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
has determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal counsel, that
failure to do so would be a breach of the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, and (C) the Company shall have given notice to Parent
that the Company has received such proposal, specifying the material terms and
conditions of such proposal, and that the

 



     

 

 



 

Company intends to take such action, and either (1) Parent shall not have
proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement prior to the
earlier to occur of the scheduled time for the Company Stockholders Meeting
and the fifth Business Day after the date on which such notice is given to
Parent, or (2) if Parent within the period described in the foregoing _clause
(1)_ shall have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Company Board (or any committee thereof), after consultation
with its financial advisors and legal counsel, shall, at the end of such
period, have determined in good faith that the Company Alternative Proposal
remains a Company Superior Proposal with respect to Parents revised proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that each time material modifications to the
financial terms of a Company Alternative Proposal determined to be a Company
Superior Proposal are made, the time period set forth in this _clause (C)_
following which the Company may effect a Company Change in Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement shall be extended for 48 hours after notification of
such change to Parent; _provided_ , _further_ , that during the time periods
set forth in this _clause (C)_ above, the Company shall cause its
Representatives (including its executive officers) to be available to
negotiate in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that such Company Alternative Proposal would no longer constitute a Company
Superior Proposal.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in response to a Company
Intervening Event that occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement, the
Company may, if the Company Board (or any committee thereof) so chooses,
effect a Company Change in Recommendation (only of the type contemplated by
_Section 6.4(c)(i)_ or _Section 6.4(c)(ii)_) if prior to taking such action
(A) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith after
consultation with its legal counsel that the failure to take such action would
be a breach of the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B)
the Company shall have given notice to Parent that the Company has determined
that a Company Intervening Event has occurred or arisen (which notice will
reasonably describe such Company Intervening Event) and that the Company
intends to effect a Company Change in Recommendation, and either (1) Parent
shall not have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement prior to the earlier to occur of (y) the scheduled time for the
Company Stockholders Meeting and (z) the fifth Business Day after the date on
which such notice is given to Parent, or (2) if Parent within the period
described in the foregoing _clause (1)_ shall have proposed revisions to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board (or any committee
thereof), after consultation with its legal counsel, shall, at the end of such
period, have determined in good faith that such proposed changes do not
obviate the need for the Company Board to effect a Company Change in
Recommendation and that the failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation
would be a breach of the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, _provided_ that during the time periods set forth in this _clause (B)_
above, the Company shall cause its Representatives (including its executive
officers) to be available to negotiate in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) any proposal by Parent to amend

 



     

 

 



 

the terms and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would obviate the
need to effect a Company Change in Recommendation.

 



 

(g) For purposes of this _Section 6.4_ and _Section 6.5_, the term "Person"
means any Person or "group," as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act,
other than, with respect to the Company, Parent or any Parent Subsidiary and
with respect to Parent, the Company.

 



 

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 6.4_ by any of the Companys controlled Affiliates or any of
their respective Representatives (solely in the case of Representatives,
acting at the Companys or any of the Companys controlled Affiliates
direction) shall be a breach of this _Section 6.4_ by the Company.

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours) advise the Company of the receipt by Parent or by
any of Parents Affiliates or, to Parents Knowledge, its or their respective
Representatives of any Parent Alternative Proposal made on or after the date
of this Agreement or any inquiries, proposals, offers request for non-public
information or data or expressions of interest relating to Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary made by any Person that may reasonably be expected to result
in a Parent Alternative Proposal or from any Person who has made or has
communicated to Parent that it intends to make a Parent Alternative Proposal
or any request for discussions or negotiations with Parent or a Representative
of Parent relating to a Parent Alternative Proposal. Parent shall provide to
the Company (within such 24 hour time frame) either (i) an unredacted copy of
any such Parent Alternative Proposal made in writing provided to Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives or, if such
Parent Alternative Proposal is not in writing, a reasonably detailed written
description of the material terms thereof (including the identity of the
Person making such Parent Alternative Proposal and the price), or (ii) a
written summary of the material terms of any such inquiry, proposal, offer,
request or expression of interest (including the identity of the Person making
such inquiry, proposal, offer, request or expression of interest and, as
applicable, the nature of the information requested). Without limiting
Parents other obligations under this _Section 6.5_, Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a timely basis (and in any event within 24 hours) with
respect to the status and material terms of any such Parent Alternative
Proposal and any material changes to the status of any such discussions or
negotiations or the nature of any information requested of Parent with respect
thereto, and shall promptly (and in no

 



     

 

 



 

event later than 24 hours after transmittal or receipt) provide the Company
with copies of any material correspondence and, with respect to material oral
communications, a written summary of such correspondence or communications,
between: (x) on the one hand, Parent or any of their Representatives; and (y)
on the other hand, the Person that made or submitted such Parent Alternative
Proposal or any Representative of such Person. Without limiting the foregoing,
Parent shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after such
determination) inform the Company in writing if Parent determines to begin
providing non-public information or to engage in discussions or negotiations
concerning a Parent Alternative Proposal pursuant to _Section 6.5(e)(ii)_.
Parent agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, enter into any
agreement with any Person which directly or indirectly prohibits Parent from
providing any information to the Company in accordance with, or otherwise
complying with, this _Section 6.5_.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent,
directly or indirectly through one or more of its Representatives, may:

 



 

(i) comply with all applicable Laws, including by issuing a "stop, look and
listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect
to a Parent Alternative Proposal if the Parent Board determines that its
failure to do so would reasonably be likely to constitute a violation of
applicable Laws;

 



 

(ii) prior to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, engage in the
activities prohibited by _Sections 6.5(b)(ii)_ or _6.5(b)(iii)_ , solely with
and to any Person who has made a written, _bona fide_ Parent Alternative
Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.5_; _provided_
, _however_ , that (A) no non-public information that is prohibited from being
furnished pursuant to _Section 6.5(b)_ may be furnished until Parent receives
an executed confidentiality agreement from such Person (an accurate and
complete copy of which shall be provided to the Company substantially
concurrently with Parents entry into such confidentiality agreement)
containing limitations on the use and disclosure of nonpublic information
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of Parent that are no less favorable
to Parent in the aggregate than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ , _further_ , that such confidentiality agreement does not contain
provisions that prohibit Parent from complying with the provisions of this
_Section 6.5_ (such agreement, a " _Parent Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), (B) Parent also provides the Company, prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time such non-public information is provided or made
available to such Person, any non-public information furnished to such other
Person that was not previously furnished to the Company, and (C) prior to
taking any such actions, the Parent Board (or a committee thereof) determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and legal
counsel, that such Parent Alternative Proposal is, or would reasonably be
expected to

 



     

 

 



 

lead to, a Parent Superior Proposal and, after consultation with its legal
counsel, that the failure to engage in such activities would be a breach of
the Parent Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

 



 

(iii) prior to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, in response to
Parents receipt of a Parent Alternative Proposal that did not result from a
breach of this _Section 6.5_, if the Parent Board (or any committee thereof)
so chooses, cause Parent to effect a Parent Change in Recommendation, if prior
to taking such action (A) Parent Board (or a committee thereof) determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and legal counsel,
that such Parent Alternative Proposal is a Parent Superior Proposal (taking
into account any adjustment to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
proposed by the Company in response to such Parent Alternative Proposal), (B)
the Parent Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its legal counsel, that failure to do so would be a breach
of the Parent Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (C) Parent
shall have given notice to the Company that Parent has received such proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such proposal, and that Parent
intends to take such action, and either (1) the Company shall not have
proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement prior to the
earlier to occur of the scheduled time for the Parent Stockholders Meeting and
the fifth Business Day after the date on which such notice is given to the
Company, or (2) if the Company within the period described in the foregoing
_clause (1)_ shall have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the Parent Board (or any committee thereof), after
consultation with its financial advisors and legal counsel, shall, at the end
of such period, have determined in good faith that the Parent Alternative
Proposal remains a Parent Superior Proposal with respect to the Companys
revised proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that each time material
modifications to the financial terms of a Parent Alternative Proposal
determined to be a Parent Superior Proposal are made, the time period set
forth in this _clause (C)_ following which Parent may effect a Parent Change
in Recommendation or terminate this Agreement shall be extended for 48 hours
after notification of such change to the Company; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that during the time periods set forth in this _clause (C)_ above, Parent
shall cause its Representatives (including its executive officers) to be
available to negotiate in good faith (to the extent the Company desires to
negotiate) any proposal by the Company to amend the terms and conditions of
this Agreement such that such Parent Alternative Proposal would no longer
constitute a Parent Superior Proposal.

 



     

 

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, in response to a Parent
Intervening Event that occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement,
Parent may, if the Parent Board (or any committee thereof) so chooses, effect
a Parent Change in Recommendation (only of the type contemplated by _Section
6.5(c)(i)_ or _Section 6.5(c)(ii)_) if prior to taking such action (A) the
Parent Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith after
consultation with its legal counsel that the failure to take such action would
be a breach of the Parent Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B)
Parent shall have given notice to the Company that Parent has determined that
a Parent Intervening Event has occurred or arisen (which notice will
reasonably describe such Parent Intervening Event) and that Parent intends to
effect a Parent Change in Recommendation, and either (1) the Company shall not
have proposed revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement prior to
the earlier to occur of (y) the scheduled time for the Parent Stockholders
Meeting and (z) the fifth Business Day after the date on which such notice is
given to the Company, or (2) if the Company within the period described in the
foregoing _clause (1)_ shall have proposed revisions to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Parent Board (or any committee thereof),
after consultation with its legal counsel, shall, at the end of such period,
have determined in good faith that such proposed changes do not obviate the
need for the Parent Board to effect a Parent Change in Recommendation and that
the failure to make a Parent Change in Recommendation would be a breach of the
Parent Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law, _provided_ that during
the time periods set forth in this _clause (B)_ above, Parent shall cause its
Representatives (including its executive officers) to be available to
negotiate in good faith (to the extent the Company desires to negotiate) any
proposal by the Company to amend the terms and conditions of this Agreement in
a manner that would obviate the need to effect a Parent Change in
Recommendation.

 



 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 6.5_ by any of Parents controlled Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives (solely in the case of Representatives, acting at
Parents or any of Parents controlled Affiliates direction) shall be a
breach of this _Section 6.5_ by Parent.

 



 

 **6.6** **_Access_** ** _to_** ** _Information:_** ** _Confidentiality_**.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time or the earlier termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, upon reasonable prior notice,

filed or submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities Laws and a copy of any communication (including "comment letters")
received by the Company from the SEC concerning compliance with securities
Laws and (ii) all other relevant information concerning its and its
Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.6(a)_,
the Company shall not be required to, or to cause any of the Company
Subsidiaries to, (i) grant such access if the Company reasonably determines
that it would cause significant risk of (A) disrupting or impairing the
business or operations of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (B)

 



     

 

 



 

constituting a violation of any contract with respect to confidentiality or
non-disclosure owing to a third party (including any Governmental Authority)
to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party, (C)
constituting a violation of any applicable Law, (D) disclosure of any
information that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets or other confidential business information, or
(E) resulting in a waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine
or similar privilege, or (ii) grant access to conduct environmental sampling
or testing or invasive or subsurface investigations.

 



 

(b) From the date hereof until the Effective Time or the earlier termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, upon reasonable prior notice,

and the Parent Subsidiaries properties, offices, commitments, books,
contracts, records and correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or
electronic form), and Representatives. Parent shall furnish promptly to the
Company (i) a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or
submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities
Laws and a copy of any communication (including "comment letters") received by
Parent from the SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and (ii) all
other relevant information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business,
properties and personnel as the Company may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.6(b)_, Parent
shall not be required to, or to cause any of the Parent Subsidiaries to, (i)
grant such access if Parent reasonably determines that it would cause
significant risk of (A) disrupting or impairing the business or operations of
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, (B) constituting a violation of any
contract with respect to confidentiality or non-disclosure owing to a third
party (including any Governmental Authority) to which Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries is a party, (C) constituting a violation of any applicable
Law, (D) disclosure of any information that in the reasonable judgment of
Parent would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets or other
confidential business information, or (E) resulting in a waiver of attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine or similar privilege, or (ii) grant
access to conduct environmental sampling or testing or invasive or subsurface
investigations.

 



 

(c) The Confidentiality Agreement dated as of January 11, 2019 between Parent
and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall apply to all information
furnished thereunder or hereunder. All information provided to any party or
its Representatives pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is deemed
to be "Confidential Information" as defined under the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



 

 **6.7** **_Public Statements_**. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company will
not, and each of the foregoing will cause its Representatives not to, issue
any public announcements or make other public disclosures regarding this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, without the prior written
approval of the Other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Party or its
Representatives may issue a public announcement or other public disclosures
required by Law or the rules of any stock exchange upon which such Partys or
its parent entitys capital stock is traded, _provided_ that such Party uses
commercially reasonable efforts to afford the Other Party an opportunity to
first review the content of the proposed disclosure and provide reasonable
comments regarding same; _provided_ , _further_ , that this

 



     

 

 



 

 _Section 6.7_ shall not be deemed to restrict in any manner the Companys
ability to communicate with its employees and that the Company shall not be
required by this _Section 6.7_ to consult with, or obtain the approval of,
any Other Party with respect to a public announcement in connection with the
receipt and existence of a Company Alternative Proposal and matters related
thereto or a Company Change in Recommendation.

 

 ** **

 

 **6.8** **_Takeover Laws_**. None of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub will
take any action that would cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, and each
of them will take all reasonable steps within its control to exempt (or ensure
the continued exemption of) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
from the Takeover Laws of any state that purport to apply to this Agreement,
the Designated Stockholder Voting Agreements or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

 **6.9** **_Obligations of Merger Sub_**. Parent shall take all action
reasonably necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, and through the earlier of the
Effective Time and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Article VIII_, Parent shall, and shall cause each of the
Parent Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its and
their Representatives to provide timely cooperation in connection with the
satisfaction of all conditions precedent to the Company Borrowing Base
Amendment or any Company Refinancing Facility, as applicable, including:

 



 

(i) executing and delivering definitive financing documents, including
guarantee and collateral documents, hedging agreements and other certificates

extent reasonably requested by the Company, making available appropriate
members of senior management of Parent to assist in the negotiation of such
agreements and other documents and instruments;

 



 

(ii) using commercially reasonable efforts to provide reasonable assistance to
the Company in connection with the preparation of pro forma financial
information to be included in any marketing materials to be used in connection
with the Company Borrowing Base Amendment or any Company Refinancing Facility,
as applicable;

 



 

(iii) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain consents of the auditors
and the relevant independent reserve engineers of Parent for use of their
reports in any materials relating to the Company Borrowing Base Amendment or
any Company Refinancing Facility, as applicable, and using commercially
reasonable efforts to cause

 



      

 

 



 

such auditors and independent reserve engineers to cooperate with the Company;
and

 



 

(iv) cooperating with the Company to satisfy the conditions precedent to the
Company Borrowing Base Amendment or any Company Refinancing Facility, as
applicable, to the extent within the control of Parent or its Affiliates, and
taking all corporate or limited liability company actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, reasonably requested by the Company to permit the
consummation of the Company Borrowing Base Amendment or any Company
Refinancing Facility.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
will be responsible for the payment of all costs and expenses incurred by
either Parent or Company in connection with the cooperation pursuant to and
compliance with this _Section 6.10_.

 



 

 **6.11** **_Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_**.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or
indemnification agreement or under the Companys Organizational Documents, or,
if applicable, the Company Subsidiaries Organizational Documents, in each
case as in effect on the date of this Agreement and made available to Parent,
during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity, jointly
and severally, will: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who (A) is
now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to the Effective Time, an
officer, director or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (B)
was an officer, director or employee of Parent prior to the Effective Time but
whose service to Parent in his or her capacity as an officer, director or
employee, as applicable, was terminated or severed as part of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and also with respect to any such Person, in such
Persons capacity as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (regardless of
whether such other entity or enterprise is affiliated with the Company or
Parent, as and if applicable) serving at the request of or on behalf of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, as and
if applicable and together with such Persons heirs, executors or
administrators (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest
extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law in connection with any
Proceeding and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
Indemnification Expenses, Judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) resulting therefrom;
and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within five (5) days after any request
for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, any
Indemnification Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with
respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any Proceeding in
advance of the final disposition of such Proceeding, including payment on
behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Indemnification
Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any
rights with respect to such indemnification or advancement, in each case
without the requirement of any bond or other security. The indemnification and
advancement obligations of Parent and the Surviving Entity

 



     

 

 



 

pursuant to this _Section 6.11_ extend to acts or omissions occurring at or
before the Effective Time and any Proceeding relating thereto (including with
respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the consummation
of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in
connection therewith and any Proceeding relating thereto), and all rights to
indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder continue as to any
Indemnified Party who has ceased to be a director or officer of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or Parent or any Parent Subsidiary after the date of
this Agreement and inure to the benefit of such persons heirs, executors and
personal and legal representatives. As used in this _Section 6.11_: (x) the
term " _Indemnification Expenses_ " means documented out of pocket attorneys
fees and expenses and all other reasonable and documented out of pocket costs,
expenses and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court
costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as
well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in
or participate in, any Proceeding for which indemnification is sought pursuant
to this _Section 6.11_, including any Proceeding relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party; and (y) the
phrase "to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law"
includes, but is not limited to (1) to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by any provision of the DGCL that authorizes or permits additional
indemnification by agreement or otherwise, or the corresponding provision of
any amendment to or replacement of the DGCL and (2) to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the DGCL
adopted after the date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which an
entity may indemnify its directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or
fiduciaries or persons serving in any capacity in which any Indemnified Party
serves, _provided_ that any amendment, alteration or repeal of the DGCL that
adversely affects any right of any Indemnified Party will be prospective only
and does not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any Proceeding
involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to
act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Entity will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
Judgment in any actual or threatened Proceeding in respect of which
indemnification has been or could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or Judgment includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Proceeding without admission or finding of wrongdoing, or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub agree that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Companys
Organizational Documents or the Company Subsidiaries Organizational Documents
will be assumed by the Surviving Entity and Parent in the Merger, without
further action, at the Effective Time and will survive the Merger and continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 



 

(c) Parents Organizational Documents, each Parent Subsidiarys Organizational
Documents, the Surviving Entitys Organizational Documents and each Company
Subsidiarys Organizational Documents will contain provisions no less
favorable in the aggregate with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses, exculpation and limitations on liability of directors and officers
than are set forth in Parents Organizational Documents, each such Parent

 



     

 

 



 

Subsidiarys Organizational Documents, the Companys Organizational Documents
and each such Company Subsidiarys Organizational Documents, which provisions
will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6)
years from the Effective Time in any manner that would affect adversely the
rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
Indemnified Parties, unless such modification is required by Law and then only
to the minimum extent required by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such
modification shall be prospective only and shall not limit or eliminate any
such right with respect to any Proceeding involving any occurrence or alleged
occurrence of any action or omission to act that took place prior to
modification; and _provided_ , _further_ _,_ that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any Proceeding made within such period continue
until the disposition of such Proceeding.

 



 

(d) Parent and the Company may each, on or prior to the Effective Time, obtain
and purchase up to six (6) years of tail coverage for their respective current
directors and officers liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies
providing coverage for post-Effective Time claims asserting actual or alleged
acts or omissions occurring prior to or at the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and is
not the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.11_.

 



 

(f) Parent will cause the Surviving Entity to perform all of the obligations
of the Surviving Entity under this _Section 6.11_.

 



 

(g) This _Section 6.11_ survives the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and to be enforceable by, the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and personal representatives, and will be
binding on Parent, the Surviving Entity and their respective successors and
assigns.

 



 

 **6.12** **_Section 16 Matters_**. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to
cause any dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) or acquisitions of equity securities of Parent
(including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, or may become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange Act.

 



 

 **6.13** **_Employee Matters_**.

 



 

(a) Until December 31, 2019 (or, if earlier, an applicable Continuing
Employees termination date) (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Entity or LLC Sub to, provide to the employees
of Parent and its Subsidiaries who remain as employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ "),
compensation and employee benefits (excluding any defined benefit pension,
equity or equity-based, deferred compensation or post-termination or retiree
health or

 



     

 

 



 

welfare benefits) in a manner that neither favors nor disfavors such
individual, in whole or in part, on the basis of whether such individual was
an employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries on the other hand, immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 6.13_ shall be
deemed satisfied in the event Parent should for the Continuation Period,
either (i) provide compensation and employee benefits (excluding any defined
benefit pension, equity or equity-based, deferred compensation or post-
termination or retiree health or welfare benefits) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and employee benefits
(excluding any defined benefit pension, equity or equity-based, deferred
compensation or post-termination or retiree health or welfare benefits) to
which the Continuing Employees were entitled immediately prior to the
Effective Time or (ii) provide compensation and employee benefits (excluding
any defined benefit pension, deferred compensation or post-termination or
retiree health or welfare benefits) to the Continuing Employees at the same
level as applies to similarly situated individuals employed by the Company its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing herein shall
limit the right of Parent or the employing Parent Subsidiary (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) to terminate the employment of any Continuing
Employee at any time. During the Continuation Period, Parent will continue to
maintain the Parent Severance Plan or a more favorable severance plan for the
benefit of Continuing Employees, and Parent shall ensure the ongoing
eligibility of any Continuing Employee who is employed by Parent as of
December 31, 2019 and who, as of the Effective Time, was eligible to receive a
payment under such plan based on continued service through December 31, 2019.

 



 

(b) During the Continuation Period, Parent shall take all commercially
reasonable actions necessary or appropriate to permit each Continuing Employee
to either continue to participate in the Parent Benefit Plans set forth on
_Section 5.12(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Letter or be eligible to
participate in the Company Benefit Plans set forth on _Section 4.11(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter. To the extent Parent causes a Continuing
Employee to cease to be eligible to participate in a Parent Benefit Plan and
instead provides for such Continuing Employee to be eligible to participate in
a Company Benefit Plan or other benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Parent
or one of its Affiliates (the " _Replacement Plans_ ") during the plan year in
which the Closing Date occurs, if such Replacement Plan is a group health
plan, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to credit (or cause to
be credited) such Continuing Employee, for the year during which such coverage
under such Replacement Plan begins, with any deductibles and copayments
already incurred during such year under the comparable Parent Benefit Plan.
Parent, the Surviving Entity, LLC Sub, their Affiliates, and the Replacement
Plans shall recognize each Continuing Employees years of service and level of
seniority with the Parent and its Subsidiaries (including service and
seniority with any other employer that was recognized prior to the Effective
Time) for purposes of terms of employment and eligibility to participate,
vesting and (for purposes of vacation and severance benefits only) benefit
determination (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit or

(e) For purposes of _Section 6.13(c)_ and for purposes of eligibility to
receive severance payments under the Parent Severance Plan (or a replacement
plan maintained or implemented in compliance with the last sentence of
_Section 6.13(a)_), an employee of Parent shall be deemed to have been
terminated without "cause" if such employee incurs a termination of employment
with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries on or within one year after the Closing
Date on account of such employee refusing to either (i) relocate his or her
principal place of employment to a location that is more than 50 miles from

modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, policy,
agreement or arrangement. The provisions of this _Section 6.13_ are for the

Agreement, or (ii) any representation or warranty of the Company becomes
untrue, and, with respect to either clause _(i)_ or _(ii)_ above, which
breach, failure to perform or untruth if it was continuing as of the Closing
Date would result in the failure of the conditions set forth in _Section
7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ to be satisfied and such breach, failure to
perform or untruth is incapable of being cured (or becoming true) or, if
capable of being cured (or becoming true), is not cured (or does not become

(f) by the Company or Parent if the Closing does not occur on or before the
date that is six (6) months from the date hereof (the " _Outside Date_ "),

failure of such Party to perform and comply in all material respects with the
covenants and agreements to be performed or complied with by such Party prior
to the Closing;

 



 

(g) by Parent, if (i) prior to, but not after, the time the Company

shall have effected a Company Change in Recommendation or (ii) the Company is
in violation in any material respect of its obligations under _Section 6.4_;

obligations of the Parties set forth in _Section 6.6(c)_, this _Section
8.3_, _Section 8.4_ and _Article IX_ hereof will survive any such
termination and are enforceable hereunder; _provided_ , _further_ , that

7. _Limitation of Liability; Indemnification._ The Corporation hereby eliminates, to the fullest extent permitted by law (as contemplated by Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL), the personal liability of any person who serves as a director of the Corporation to the Corporation and/or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (i) for any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for any act or omission not in good faith or which involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
