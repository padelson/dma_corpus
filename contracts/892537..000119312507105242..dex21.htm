dissenting shareholders pursuant to Sections 1300-1312 of the California
Corporations Code unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or

Code, such holders shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted
into and to have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to
receive the amount set forth in Section 2.7(f). Dissenting Shareholder claims

Article VII; provided, however, that Buyer shall be obligated to pay any
amount due to any Dissenting Shareholder only up to the amount that would have
been paid to such Dissenting Shareholder hereunder if such Shareholder had

Dissenting Shareholder shall be the obligation of the Seller Parties in

agreement with the holder of any Dissenting Shares relating to the Dissenting
Shares of such holder or a waiver by any such holder of his or her rights

prior written consent of the Shareholder Representative, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld.

purchase shares of Company Common Stock, to the extent not already fully

exercisable, and shall receive the payment therefor set forth in Section
2.7(d) and Section 2.7(i) provided that such Option Holder enters into an
"Option Payout Agreement", in substantially the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit E_ , with the Company. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and

rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificates.

(i) _Tax Withholding_. Buyer, on behalf of the Company, shall be entitled to

whom such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer (or any Affiliate

Section 2.9 _Working Capital Adjustments_.

(a) The "Closing Working Capital Adjustment" shall be the positive or negative
difference, if any, by which the Closing Working Capital (as defined below)
differs from Nineteen Million Five Hundred Thousand dollars ($19,500,000) (the
"Required Target Amount"). If the Closing Working Capital exceeds the Required
Target Amount, then the Closing Working Capital Adjustment shall be positive;
and if the Closing Working Capital is less than the Required Target Amount,
then the Closing Working Capital Adjustment shall be negative. The Company
shall estimate in good faith the Closing Working Capital, as of Closing, and
deliver (i) such estimate, which shall include an unaudited balance sheet of
the Company as of a date within three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date that (A) is prepared in a manner consistent with the accounting
principles, practices, methodologies and policies used by the Company which
are in accordance with GAAP in the preparation of the Company Balance Sheet
(the "Accounting Principles"), and (B) reflects an accrual for Company
contributions to  



 

\- 23 -  the Companys 401(k) profit sharing plan and an accrual for any employee
bonuses in the ordinary course of business through the Closing Date and
any reduction in accrued taxes arising from the payment by the Company of the
Option Holder Payout Amount; and (ii) copies of the working papers used to
prepare such estimate and unaudited balance sheet to Buyer, no later than
three (3) Business Days before the Closing Date (the difference between such
estimate and the Required Target Amount, if any, being the "Estimated Working
Capital Adjustment"). As provided in Section 2.7(a), the Initial
Purchase Price shall be adjusted for the Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment, if any. The Closing Working Capital shall be finally determined in
accordance with Section 2.9(b) and Section 2.10.

(b) Promptly after the Closing, Buyers independent accountants shall, at
Buyers expense, (i) audit the books of account of the Company as of the
Closing Date, and (ii) prepare an audited balance sheet of the Company as of
the Closing Date, which shall set forth the working capital of the Company as
of the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet"). The Closing Date
Balance Sheet, which shall not give effect to the consummation of the Merger
at the Effective Time, shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Principles and shall be accompanied by an unqualified report of
Buyers independent accountants on the Closing Date Balance Sheet certifying
that the Closing Date Balance Sheet and any related notes thereto were
prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles. The Merger Parties
acknowledge that (A) the sole purpose of the determination of Closing Working
Capital is to adjust the Initial Purchase Price so as to reflect the
difference, if any, between the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment and the
Closing Working Capital Adjustment. For purposes of this Agreement, "Closing
Working Capital" shall mean (i) the Companys current assets (including Cash,
which shall include the cash payment by Buyer to the Company, as well as

hereof) as of the Closing, but immediately prior to the consummation of the

Debt, Identified Company Obligations, Transaction Fees, and Accounting Fees)
as of Closing, in each case as reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet.

(a) Buyer, based on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, shall provide to the
Shareholder Representative, within one hundred twenty (120) days after
Closing, (i) a copy of the Closing Date Balance Sheet accompanied by the
unqualified report of the Companys accountant as provided in Section 2.9(b),
and (ii) a written notice (the "Buyer Purchase Price Adjustment Notice")
providing Buyers calculation of (A) the Closing Working Capital Adjustment,
if any (the "Actual Working Capital Adjustment"); (B) the amount by which,
if any, Closing Working Capital exceeds the Required Target Amount and, in
such case, the amount, if any, by which a positive Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment is less than a positive Actual Working Capital Adjustment or the
amount, if any, by which a negative Estimated Working Capital Adjustment is
greater than a negative Actual Working Capital Adjustment or the spread, if
any, between a negative Estimated Working Capital Adjustment and a positive
Actual Working Capital Adjustment (in each such case, a "Shareholder Working
Capital Adjustment"); and (C) the amount by which, if any, Required Target
Amount exceeds Closing Working Capital and, in such case, the amount, if any,
by which a positive Estimated Working Capital Adjustment is greater than a
positive Actual Working Capital Adjustment or the amount, if any, by which a
negative Estimated Working Capital Adjustment is less than a negative Actual
 



 

\- 24 -  Working Capital Adjustment or the spread, if any, between a positive
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment and a negative Actual Working Capital
Adjustment (in each such case, a "Buyer Working Capital Adjustment").

(b) Buyer, at the Shareholder Representatives request, shall allow the
Shareholder Representative and his or her representatives reasonable access at
all reasonable times to the Surviving Corporations and Companys accountants,
personnel, properties, Books and Records, work papers, schedules and
calculations relating to (i) the Closing Date Balance Sheet, (ii) the Actual
Working Capital Adjustment, and (iii) the Buyer Working Capital Adjustment, if
any, or the Shareholder Working Capital Adjustment, if any, for the purpose
of reviewing the Buyer Purchase Price Adjustment Notice, the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and confirming the accuracy of the preparation and the amounts
thereof. Any Buyer Working Capital Adjustment or Shareholder Working Capital
Adjustment shall be paid within fifteen (15) Business Days of the Shareholder
Representatives receipt of the Buyer Purchase Price Adjustment Notice, except
for any Buyer Working Capital Adjustment or Shareholder Working Capital
Adjustment, as the case may be, for which the Shareholder Representative has
provided Buyer with a Shareholder Purchase Price Adjustment Objection Notice
(as defined below). In the event that the Shareholder Representative provides
Buyer with a written notice (a "Shareholder Purchase Price Adjustment
Objection Notice"), no later than twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of
the Buyer Purchase Price Adjustment Notice, that the Shareholder
Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders and Option Holders, in good
faith disputes Buyers independent accountants determination of the Actual
Working Capital Adjustment, if any, the Buyer Working Capital Adjustment, if
any, or the Shareholder Working Capital Adjustment, if any, determined in
accordance with Section 2.10(a), the Shareholder Representative and Buyer
shall then meet and negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute, such
negotiation to begin as soon as practicable (but in any case, no later than
thirty (30) days) after Buyers receipt of the Shareholder Purchase Price
Adjustment Objection Notice.

(c) In the event that Buyer and the Shareholder Representative are not able
to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days after the date on which Buyer
receives the Shareholder Purchase Price Adjustment Objection Notice, then
either the Shareholder Representative or Buyer may refer the issues in
dispute to a neutral, mutually acceptable independent accounting firm of
national reputation with which no party hereto has had a preexisting
relationship for resolution (the "Purchase Price Adjustment Referee") and,
immediately thereafter, shall provide notice of such referral to the other
Merger Parties. The decision of such issues by the Purchase Price Adjustment
Referee shall be final and binding on all Merger Parties. The Merger Parties
shall submit their positions on the dispute to the Purchase Price Adjustment
Referee within fifteen (15) days after referral, and shall direct the Purchase
Price Adjustment Referee to decide the dispute within thirty (30) days after
referral. The Purchase Price Adjustment Referee also shall determine which of
the parties was least correct overall with respect to the positions submitted
with respect to the dispute, and such party shall pay the fees and expenses
of the Purchase Price Adjustment Referee.

(d) On the applicable date referred to in Section 2.10(b) (with regard to
payments for which if there is no dispute) or within fifteen (15) Business
Days after final determination is made either by mutual agreement of the Buyer
and the Shareholder Representative as provided in Section 2.10(b) or by the
Purchase Price Adjustment Referee as  



 

\- 25 -  provided in Section 2,10(c), (i) Buyer shall pay to the Seller Parties their
respective Pro Rata Equity Percentages of the amount of any Shareholder
Working Capital Adjustment in favor of the Shareholders, or (ii) there shall
be paid to Buyer the amount of any Buyer Working Capital Adjustment in favor
of the Buyer, as the case may be. Any such payment or payments shall
be hereinafter referred to as the "Purchase Price Adjustment Final Payments".
Any Buyer Working Capital Adjustment in favor of Buyer shall be paid first
from the General Escrow Fund in an amount not to exceed Two Million
dollars ($2,000,000) in the aggregate, with any remaining Buyer Working
Capital Adjustment to be paid by the Seller Parties severally, pro rata, in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Equity Percentages.

(e) Any Purchase Price Adjustment Final Payment shall be made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds after its final determination in
accordance with this Section 2.10 to account(s) specified by Buyer and the
Shareholder Representative, as the case may be, to receive the Purchase Price
Adjustment Final Payment; provided, however, that any Purchase Price
Adjustment Final Payment due to the Buyer shall be drawn upon the Escrow
Account and further provided, that if the amount of any Purchase Price
Adjustment Final Payment that is payable by Buyer to the Seller Parties is
less than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand dollars ($250,000), such payment may be
made by issuing checks written and drawable against immediately available
funds, in lieu of wire transfers for such payments.

ARTICLE VII __

_INDEMNIFICATION_

Section 7.1 _Indemnification by the Shareholders, Option Holders and the
Company_. 

Subject to Section 7.3, the Shareholders and the Option Holders (each, a
"Seller Indemnifying Party" and, collectively, the "Seller Indemnifying
Parties") severally, and pro rata in accordance with their Pro Rata Equity
Percentages, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless, in the manner and to
the extent set forth in this Article VII, Buyer, Merger Sub and Buyers
Affiliates (collectively, the "Buyer Parties") from and against any and all
Losses asserted against, imposed on, or incurred or suffered by any Buyer
Parties as a result of (a) the inaccuracy of any representation or the breach
of any warranty set forth in Article III, as modified by any Company
Disclosure Schedule, or in any agreement or certificate executed and delivered
by the Company at the Closing pursuant to this Agreement (a "Company Closing
 



 

\- 67 -  Instrument"); (b) the non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the
part of the Company set forth in this Agreement or in any Company Closing
Instrument; or (c) any payments made or liabilities incurred by Buyer, arising
in connection with payments to holders of Dissenting Shares who have perfected
their rights to be Dissenting Shareholders under the California
Corporations Code, that are in excess of the portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to any such holder of Dissenting Shares in
connection with this Agreement (collectively, "Indemnified Losses"). Each
Seller Indemnifying Party irrevocably waives any and all rights to recourse
against the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any
misrepresentation or breach of any representation, warranty or indemnity, or
noncompliance with any conditions, covenants or agreements, given or made by
the Company in this Agreement. No Seller Indemnifying Party shall be entitled
to contribution from, subrogation to or recovery against the Company or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to any payments that are made for the
account of such Seller Indemnifying Party to Buyer or any other Buyer Party
pursuant to Article VII.

Section 7.2  _Indemnification by Buyer and Merger Sub_.

Subject to Section 7.3(a) hereof, Buyer and Merger Sub shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify, defend and hold the Shareholders and the Option Holders
harmless from and against any and all Losses asserted against, imposed on, or
incurred or suffered by the Shareholders or the Option Holders, as a result of
(a) the inaccuracy of any representation or the breach of any warranty set
forth in Article IV, any Buyer Disclosure Schedule or in any agreement or
certificate executed and delivered by Buyer or Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement; or (b) the non-fulfillment of any material covenant or agreement
on the part of Buyer or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or in any
agreement or certificate executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 7.3 _Survival of Representations and Warranties; Limitations on
Indemnification_.

(a) _Survival_. The representations and warranties in this Agreement and the
indemnification provisions in this Agreement with respect thereto
shall survive the Closing for a period of eighteen (18) months following the
Closing Date, at which time they shall terminate and no Indemnification Claim
shall thereafter be brought nor shall any party seeking indemnification
therefor be entitled to obtain such indemnification in respect of any such
Indemnification Claim; provided, however, that such termination shall not
affect any Indemnification Claim for breach of any representation or warranty
if written notice thereof, in reasonable detail, has been given either by
Buyer to the Shareholder Representative or by the Shareholder Representative
to the Buyer, as the case may be, prior to such termination date (in such
case, the survival period for the representation and warranty shall continue
until such Indemnification Claim is fully resolved in the manner set forth in
Section 7.5 hereof). The covenants of the parties set forth in this Agreement
to be performed after the Closing, and the rights to indemnification for any
breach thereof, shall survive until performed. Notwithstanding the foregoing
to the contrary, the representations and warranties in Sections 3.1, 3.2(a),
3.3, 3.4, 3.6, or 3.22 of this Agreement and the indemnification obligations
of the Seller Indemnifying Parties with respect thereto under Section 7.1, as
limited by the applicable provisions of this Section 7.3 and Section 7.6,
shall survive for three (3) years following the Closing Date.



 

\- 68 - (b) _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer Parties shall only be entitled to
indemnification from the Seller Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this Article
VII only if and to the extent that the amount of all Indemnified Losses
incurred in the aggregate by the Buyer Parties exceeds Five Hundred Thousand
dollars ($500,000) (the "Deductible Amount"). If the aggregate amount of all
Indemnified Losses incurred by the Buyer Parties for which Indemnification
Claims have been made by Buyer within the applicable survival period set
forth in Section 7.3(a) exceeds in the aggregate the Deductible Amount, the
Buyer Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for all Buyer Indemnified
Losses actually incurred and for which Indemnification Claims are made within
the applicable survival period, in excess of the Deductible Amount; provided,
however, that, subject to the exceptions set forth in Section 7.3(c) below, in
no event and under no circumstance shall the maximum aggregate cumulative
liability of the Seller Parties for any and all Buyer Indemnified Losses
exceed the sum of $35,100,000 (the "Indemnification Cap"), provided, however,
that, subject to the exceptions set forth in Sections 7.3(c)(i)
and 7.3(c)(iii) below, all Buyer Indemnified Losses with respect to which any
Buyer Party is determined, in the manner set forth in Section 7.5 below, to be
entitled to indemnification from the Seller Parties pursuant to this Article
VII shall be paid and satisfied, in accordance with the terms and provisions
of Sections 7.4 and 7.5 hereof, solely and exclusively out of and only to the
extent of the funds in the General Escrow Fund, even if the total of such
funds is less than the amount of the Indemnification Cap due to distributions
therefrom made pursuant to Section 7.4 hereof and the applicable provisions of
the Escrow Agreement, and no Seller Party shall have any personal liability to
any of the Buyer Parties with respect to or for any Buyer Indemnified Losses,
except as set forth in Section 7.3(c)(1) and Section 7.3(c) (iii).

(c) _Certain Exceptions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary that may
be set forth in either Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) above:

(i) In the event that any Buyer Party incurs any Buyer Indemnified Losses
arising from a breach of any Shareholder Ownership Representation or Option
Holder Option Representation (as such terms are defined and referenced in
Section 3.4 hereof and which Representations shall survive for a period of
eighteen (18) months after the Effective Time), such Seller Indemnifying Party
(the "Breaching Seller Party"), shall be severally obligated to indemnify the
Buyer Parties for the Buyer Indemnified Losses arising from such breach (a
"Seller Party Breach"), and none of the other Seller Parties shall have any
liability for, and, subject to Section 7.3(c)(ii) hereof, the Buyer Parties
shall have recourse only against such Breaching Seller Party to recover any
such Buyer Indemnified Losses, and, in any such case, the Indemnification
Deductible shall not apply to such Indemnification Claim and the
Indemnification Cap applicable to the liability of such Breaching Seller
Party shall be equal to the amount of the Adjusted Purchase Price or Option
Holder Payment Amount, as the case may be, actually paid to such Breaching
Seller Party pursuant to this Agreement for or in respect of the Shares or
Convertible Options as to which such breach of the Ownership Representation or
the Option Holder Option Representation (as the case may be) relates and the
survival period during which the Buyer Parties may seek such
indemnification against any Breaching Seller Party shall be the statute of
limits applicable to such breach.

(ii) Notwithstanding the fact that Buyers recourse for recovery of its
Losses occasioned by a breach by a Shareholder of his or her Ownership
Representation or by an  



 

\- 69 -  Option Holder of his or her Option Holder Representation shall initially be
solely against the Breaching Seller Party, Buyer shall be entitled to notify
the Shareholder Representative, in writing, of the incurrence of the Losses
occasioned by such breach (a "Special Escrow Claim"), which shall be required
to describe, in reasonable detail, the circumstances that caused such
Losses. After providing the Special Escrow Claim to the Shareholder
Representative, Buyer shall be entitled to be paid from the Special Escrow
Fund all fees, costs, and expenses, including without limitation reasonable
attorney fees incurred in pursuit of recovering such Losses. If, despite the
diligent and good faith efforts of Buyer to recover its Losses from the
Breaching Seller Party through the exercise of available legal remedies, it
has been unable to fully recover such Losses from the Breaching Seller Party
and it delivered or delivers a Special Escrow Claim to the Shareholder
Representative not later than the aforementioned eighteen (18)-month survival
period that is applicable to a breach of any Seller Ownership
Representation and a breach of any Option Holder Representation, as the case
may be, then Buyer may seek recovery of those of all such Losses that it was
unable to recover from the Breaching Seller Party from the Special Escrow Fund
maintained with the Escrow Agent in accordance with the provisions of Section
7.5 below.

(iii) In the event it is determined that any Buyer Indemnified Losses were
incurred as a consequence of any common law fraud on the part of the Company
in connection with any representation or warranty made by the Company in this
Agreement or in any Company Closing Instrument, then the Deductible Amount
shall not apply to any Indemnification Claim that may be brought in respect
thereof by the Buyer Parties and the Indemnification Cap applicable thereto
shall be fifty percent (50%) of the Initial Purchase Price and the survival
period during which the Buyer Parties may seek such indemnification against
the Seller Parties shall be the statute of limits applicable thereto,
provided, however, that the Buyer Parties shall first exhaust the funds in the
General Escrow Account before seeking any recovery from any of the Seller
Parties, personally, in respect of the Buyer Indemnified Losses incurred as a
result of such common law fraud

(d) _Insurance Proceeds_. A party determined to be entitled to indemnification
hereunder with respect to an Indemnification Claim asserted hereunder (an
"indemnified party") shall reimburse the party obligated to indemnify the
indemnified party with respect thereto (the "indemnifying party") amounts paid
to the indemnified party by such indemnifying party with respect to a Loss
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to the extent that such indemnified
party receives any insurance proceeds with respect to such Loss.

(e) _Mitigation_. Each party agrees to take commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate their respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of conditions
giving rise to Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

(f) _Subrogation_. Upon making any payment to the indemnified party for an
indemnification claim hereunder, the indemnitor shall be subrogated to the
extent of such payment to any rights that the indemnified party may have
against any third parties with respect to the subject matter underlying such
indemnification claim.

(g) _Third Party Claims_. In calculating any Losses there shall be deducted
any indemnification, contribution or other similar payment actually recovered
by the indemnified party or any Affiliate thereof from any third Person with
respect thereto so long as such recovered claim has been finally determined
and is not subject to appeal.



 

\- 70 - (h) _Accounts Receivable_. To the extent that the Seller Parties are subject
to an Indemnification Claim arising hereunder due to a breach of Section
3.10, the Shareholder Representative shall be permitted to assist in any
collection efforts with respect to any account receivable giving rise to such
breach.

(i) _No Duplication of Indemnification Payments_. All Indemnification Payments
shall be calculated without duplication in any case in which more than one of
the Buyer Parties seeks indemnification for the same Buyer Indemnified Loss or
Losses or in the event that any events or circumstances giving rise to a
breach of a particular representation or warranty of the Company or the
Buyer Parties, as the case may be, contained in this Agreement or in such
partys Closing Instruments, also constitutes a breach of one or more other
representations or warranties of such party contained in contained in this
Agreement or in such partys Closing Instruments. The Buyer Parties shall not
be entitled to indemnification under this Article VII for any Buyer
Indemnified Losses if and to the extent that such Losses were taken into
account (such as being applied as a reduction in current assets or an
increase in current liabilities), in the determination of the Actual Working
Capital Adjustment or in any other adjustment that may be made to the Initial
Purchase Price.

(j) _No Special or Punitive Damages_. Indemnified Losses shall not include any
special, exemplary or punitive damages, and neither the Seller Parties nor
the Buyer Parties shall be liable for any special, exemplary or punitive
damages under this Agreement, except to the extent that such special,
exemplary or punitive are asserted and recovered by a Third Party.

(k) _Effect of Reserves_. The amount of any Losses for which any Buyer Party
would otherwise become entitled to be indemnified under this Article VII
shall be reduced by the amount, if any, of any specific accruals or reserves
for such Losses reflected in the Companys Closing Balance Sheet. By way of
example, if any Losses were incurred by Buyer as a result of the imposition of
any Pre-Closing Taxes on Buyer, but the Company had accrued for or maintained
a reserve on its balance sheet for such Taxes, then, the amount of the Losses
attributable to such Pre-Closing Taxes for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties
would be entitled to be indemnified hereunder shall be reduced by the amount
of such accruals or reserve (as the case may be); provided, however, that such
Losses would not be reduced by the amount of any general reserves on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet or reserves or accruals specified for other
categories.

(l) _Effect of Certain Actions by Buyer Parties_. The Buyer Parties shall not
be entitled to recover any of their Losses under this Article VII to the
extent that such Losses arose primarily from the intentional wrongdoing of any
of the Buyer Parties.

Section 7.4 _Escrow Account_.

(a) _Deposit of Funds into Escrow Account_. At the Effective Time, Buyer
shall deposit, on behalf of the Seller Indemnifying Parties as contemplated by
Section 2.7(c) hereof, the Escrow Amount, consisting of (i) $33,100,000 which
will comprise the General  



 

\- 71 -  Escrow Fund that shall be available for all Buyer Indemnification Claims
other than Special Escrow Claims, (ii) $2,000,000 which will comprise
the Special Escrow Fund from which the Buyer may recover Losses incurred as a
result of any Seller Party Breach for the first eighteen (18) months after the
Effective Time (after which amounts remaining therein shall become part of the
General Escrow Fund and be available for any other Losses for which the Buyer
Parties are determined to be entitled to indemnification under Section 7.5),
and (iii) $1,000,000 which will comprise the Shareholder Representative
Expense Fund, from which the Shareholder Representative may pay or be
reimbursed for Shareholder Representative Expenses that the Shareholder
Representative incurs. Each of such Funds shall be maintained in a separate
sub-account (each an "Escrow Sub-Account") by the Escrow Agent and the funds
in any Escrow Sub-Account shall not be commingled with the funds in any of the
other Escrow Sub-Account. In the event that it is determined that any Buyer
Party has become entitled to be paid an indemnification payment pursuant to
this Article VII, then, subject to the exceptions set forth in Paragraph
7.3(c) above, such payment shall be made solely and exclusively from the
applicable Escrow Sub-Account through an offset against such Escrow Sub-
Account, provided that the foregoing provision shall not preclude Buyer from
seeking or obtaining any injunctive relief or other non-monetary remedies to
which Buyer is determined to be entitled, at equity, under this Agreement. 

(b) _Escrow Period; Distributions From the Escrow Account_.

(i) On the date of the expiration of the first twelve (12) months immediately
following the Effective Time (the "First General Escrow Fund Distribution

an amount from the General Escrow Fund (the "First General Escrow Fund
Distribution Amount") equal to thirty-three and one-third percent (33- 1/3%)
of the then remaining amount in the General Escrow Fund, as of the First
General Escrow Fund Distribution Date, that is in excess of the sum of the
amount that in the reasonable and good faith judgment of Buyer, subject to
the objection of the Shareholder Representative and the subsequent settlement
or arbitration of the matter in the manner provided in Section 7.5 below, is
necessary to satisfy (A) each then pending unsatisfied Buyer Indemnification
Claim made against the General Escrow Fund in accordance with the provisions
of Section 7.5(b), and (B) any unsatisfied indemnification payments that have
been previously determined to be payable to any of the Buyer Parties from the
General Escrow Fund (each, an "Unresolved General Escrow Fund Indemnification
Claim") and (C) any Shareholder Representative Expenses for which payment
cannot be made from the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund due to a lack
of sufficient funds therein (a "Shareholder Representative Expense
Shortfall").

(ii) On the date that is the second anniversary of the Effective Time (the
"Second General Escrow Fund Distribution Date"), the Escrow Agent shall
distribute or cause to be distributed to the Seller Parties, in proportion to
their respective Pro Rata Equity Percentages, an amount from the General
Escrow Fund (the "Second General Escrow Fund Distribution Amount"), equal to
the sum of (A) fifty percent (50%) of the then remaining amount in the General
Escrow Fund, as of the Second General Escrow Fund Distribution Date, and (B)
an amount equal to sixteen and two-thirds percent (16.67%) of the amount
transferred from the Special Escrow Fund to the General Escrow Fund pursuant

As soon as practicable, but in any event, no later than fifteen (15)
days after the Escrow Termination Date, the Escrow Agent shall distribute or
cause to be distributed to the Seller Parties, in proportion to their
respective Pro Rata Equity Percentages, an amount from the General Escrow Fund
(the "Termination Date General Escrow Fund Distribution Amount") equal to any
excess of the then remaining amount in the General Escrow Fund over the sum of
(A) the amount (hereinafter, the "General Escrow Termination Date
Reserved Amount") which, in the reasonable good faith judgment of Buyer,
subject to the objection of the Shareholder Representative and the subsequent
settlement or arbitration of the matter in the manner provided in Section 7.5
below, is necessary to satisfy any then remaining Unresolved General Escrow
Fund Indemnification Claims existing on the Escrow Termination Date (the
"Unresolved General Escrow Termination Date Indemnification Claims") which are
set forth in a notice (the "General Escrow Fund Termination Date Claims
Notice") that shall contain a reasonably detailed description of each of such
unresolved claims and the respective amounts thereof and which Unresolved
General Escrow Termination Date Claims Notice must be delivered to the Escrow
Agent and to the Shareholder Representative by Buyer no later than the Escrow
Termination Date and (B) the amount of any Shareholder Representative Expense
Shortfall.

(iv) On the Special Escrow Termination Date, the Escrow Agent shall deposit or
cause to be deposited into the General Escrow Fund the then remaining amount
in the Special Escrow Fund that is in excess of the amount (the "Special
Escrow Termination Date Reserved Amount"), if any, that in the reasonable and
good faith judgment of Buyer, subject to the objection of the
Shareholder Representative and the subsequent settlement or arbitration of
the matter in the manner provided in Section 7.5 below, is necessary to
satisfy (A) each then pending unsatisfied Special Escrow Claim made, within
the survival period applicable to such Claim, against the Special Escrow Fund
in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.5(b), and (B) any unsatisfied
indemnification payments that have been previously determined to be payable to
Buyer from the Special Escrow Fund in satisfaction of an established Special
Escrow Claim for which amounts have not theretofore been reserved in the

Termination Date Indemnification Claims") which are set forth in a notice
(the "Special Escrow Fund Termination Date Claims Notice") that shall contain
a reasonably detailed description of each of such Unresolved Special Escrow
Fund Termination Date Indemnification Claims and the respective amounts
thereof and which Unresolved Special Escrow Fund Termination Date Claims
Notice must be delivered to the Escrow Agent and to the Shareholder
Representative by Buyer by no later than the Special Escrow Termination Date.
After payment of the remaining balance of the Special Escrow Fund into the
General Escrow Fund, such funds shall become part of the General Escrow Fund
and shall be available to satisfy any claims against the General Escrow Fund.

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary that may be set forth elsewhere
in this Agreement, the General Escrow Fund and the Special Escrow fund shall
 



 

\- 73 -  continue in full force and effect until, in the case of the General Escrow
Fund, all of the Unresolved General Escrow Termination Date Indemnification
Claims have been resolved, and in the case of the Special Escrow Fund, until
all of the Unresolved Special Fund Termination Date Indemnification Claims
have been resolved, by settlement or arbitration in the manner provided in
Section 7.5 below. 

(vi) The amount of each Unresolved General Escrow Termination Date
Indemnification Claim, as set forth in the General Escrow Fund Termination
Date Claims Notice with respect thereto (the "General Escrow Fund Termination
Date Reserved Amount"), shall be retained in the General Escrow Fund, and the
amount of each Unresolved Special Escrow Fund Termination
Date Indemnification Claim, as set forth in each Special Escrow Fund
Termination Date Claims Notice (the "Special Escrow Funds Termination Date
Reserved Amount"), shall be retained in the Special Escrow Fund Account, until
such Unresolved General Escrow Fund Indemnification Claim or such Unresolved
Special Fund Termination Date Indemnification Claim, as the case may be, is
finally resolved (whether by settlement or arbitration or otherwise) in
accordance with Section 7.5. Promptly following such resolution, such General
Escrow Termination Date Reserved Amount or such Special Escrow Fund
Termination Date Reserved Amount, as the case may be, shall be distributed to
the Buyer to the extent of any Losses for which any Buyer Parties have been
determined (in accordance with Section 7.5 hereof) to be entitled to
indemnification form the General Escrow Fund or the Special Escrow Fund, as
the may be, under this Article VII or an amount equal to the then remaining
funds in such General Escrow Fund or Special Escrow Fund, as the case may be,
whichever is less, and the remainder of the reserved amount in each such
Escrow Sub-Account, if any, shall be distributed to the Seller Parties
in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Equity Percentages.

(vii) The Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Shareholder
Representative, from the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund, such
amounts as are requested in writing by the Shareholder Representative for the
purpose of paying or reimbursing any Shareholder Representative Expenses
incurred by the Shareholder Representative. If there occurs, or the
Shareholder Representative reasonably believes that there will occur, a
Shareholder Representative Expense Shortfall and the Shareholder
Representative provides a written notice thereof to the Escrow Agent on or
prior to any General Fund Escrow Termination Date, then, the Escrow Agent
shall transfer into the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund the amount of
the Shortfall set forth in that notice from the amounts otherwise
distributable to the Seller Parties on such General Fund Escrow Termination
Date. Any request or notice to be given to the Escrow Agent by or on behalf of
the Shareholder Representative pursuant to this Section 7.4(b)(vii) shall be
in writing and shall be executed by at least two of the then incumbent
members of the committee comprising the Shareholder Representative. At such
time or times as the Shareholder Representative so instructs the Escrow Agent,
in writing, Escrow Agent shall distribute amounts from the
Shareholder Representative Expense Fund to the Seller Parties in proportion
to their respective Pro Rata Equity Percentages.



 

\- 74 - Section 7.5 _Method of Asserting Claims_.

All claims for indemnification by a party entitled to be indemnified hereunder
("Indemnification Claims") shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) _Claims by Buyer Parties_. In the event a Buyer Party has an
Indemnification Claim for an Indemnified Loss against the Indemnifying
Parties (a "Buyer Claim"), Buyer Parties shall promptly notify the Shareholder
Representative, in writing of such Claim specifying the nature of that\\\Claim
and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible
(which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim)
(the "Claim Notice"). If the Shareholder Representative does not dispute all
or any part the Buyer Indemnification Claim in a written notice delivered to
the Buyer within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Claim Notice, the
Shareholder Representative shall be deemed to have accepted responsibility for
that\\\undisputed Buyer Indemnification Claim set forth in such Notice, on
behalf of the Seller Parties, and shall have no further right to contest such
undisputed Buyer Indemnification Claim. Buyer may proceed to collect the
undisputed amount of the Buyer Indemnification Claim from the Escrow Account,
as set forth in Sections 7.5(b) and 7.5(c), as applicable. If the Shareholder
Representative disputes any portion of a Buyer Indemnification Claim in
writing in accordance with this Section 7.5(a), the parties shall attempt to
resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 7.5(d).

(b) _Claims Upon Escrow Account_. In accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, upon receipt by the Escrow Agent at any time on or before the
Escrow Termination Date or the Special Escrow Termination Date, as the case
may be, of a certificate signed by any officer of Buyer: (i) stating that
Buyer has paid or properly accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will
have to pay or accrue Indemnified Losses subject to indemnification from the
General Escrow Fund or the Special Escrow Fund, and (ii) specifying in
reasonable detail the individual items of Indemnified Losses included in the
amount so stated, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of Section
7.5(c), be directed to distribute to Buyer from the applicable Escrow Account
as promptly as practicable, funds in an amount equal to such Indemnified
Losses. 

(c) _Objections to Claims_. At the time of delivery of any certificate
described in Section 7.5(b) to the Escrow Agent, a duplicate copy of such
certificate shall be delivered by Buyer to the Shareholder Representative and
for a period of thirty (30) days after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall
make no distribution to Buyer of any funds contained in the applicable Escrow
Account against which the Buyer Indemnification Claim was made pursuant to
Section 7.5(b) unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written
authorization from the Shareholder Representative to make such distribution.
After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the Escrow Agent shall
be directed to distribute funds from the applicable Escrow Account in
accordance with Section 7.5(b), provided that no such payment or delivery may
be made if the Shareholder Representative shall object in a written statement
to the Buyer Indemnification Claim made in such certificate, and such
statement shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the
expiration of such thirty (30)-day period. 

(d) Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.

(i) In case the Shareholder Representative shall so object in writing to any
Buyer Claims made in an officers certificate or any Claim Notice, Buyer shall
have ten (10) 



 

\- 75 -  days to respond in a written statement to the objection of the Shareholder
Representative or the Company, as applicable. If after such ten (10)-day
period, there remains a dispute as to any such Buyer Indemnification Claim,
Buyer and the Shareholder Representative shall attempt in good faith for
thirty (30) days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each of such Buyer Indemnification Claim. If the Shareholder
Representative and Buyer should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by the Shareholder Representative and
Buyer, and shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent and the Escrow Agent shall
be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and distribute funds from the
Escrow Account in accordance with the terms thereof.

(ii) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either
Buyer, on the one hand, or the Shareholder Representative, on the other, may
demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the Loss is at issue in
pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be
commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by
arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to Buyer and the
Shareholder Representative. In the event that within forty-five (45) days
after submission of any dispute to arbitration, Buyer and the Shareholder
Representative cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, Buyer and the
Shareholder Representative shall each select one arbitrator, and the two
arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator to handle the dispute.
The arbitrator shall set a limited time period and establish procedures
designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing the parties
an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator to discover
relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject matter
of the dispute. The arbitrator shall rule upon motions to compel or limit
discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneys fees and costs, to the extent as a court of competent law or
equity, should the arbitrator determine that discovery was sought without
substantial justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without
substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator as to the validity
and amount of any claim in such officers certificate or Buyer Claim Notice
shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and Buyer
and Shareholder Representative shall direct the Escrow Agent to act in
accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the
applicable Escrow Account in accordance therewith. The arbitrators decision
shall be written and shall be supported by written findings of fact and
conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment, decree or order awarded
by the arbitrator.

(iii) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Orange
County, California under the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration
Association. The arbitrator shall determine how all expenses relating to the
arbitration shall be paid, including the respective expenses of each party,
the fees of each arbitrator and the administrative fee of the American
Arbitration Association.

(e) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event a Buyer Party becomes aware of a
third-party claim that Buyer believes may result in a demand against the
Escrow Amount (a "Third-Party Claim"), Buyer shall promptly provide a Claim
Notice to the Shareholder Representative with respect to such Third-Party
Claim. The Shareholder Representative, on behalf of the Seller Indemnifying
Parties, at the Seller Indemnifying Parties sole cost and expense, to be paid
from  



 

\- 76 -  the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund or from amounts distributed from
the Escrow for the account of the Seller Parties pursuant to Section 7.4(b),
has the right, exercisable by written notice to Buyer within thirty (30) days
after receipt of a Claim Notice from Buyer with respect to a Third-Party
Claim, to be represented by counsel of its choice and reasonably acceptable
to Buyer and, subject to the satisfaction of the Litigation Conditions set
forth below, to assume, control, defend against, negotiate and otherwise deal
with any proceeding, claim, or demand which relates to any Indemnified Loss
with respect to such Third-Party Claim in accordance with the limits on
indemnification set forth in this Agreement; provided, however, that the (i)
defense of such Third-Party Claim by the Shareholder Representative is not
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer; (ii) the Third-
Party Claim solely seeks (and continues to seek) monetary damages; and (iii)
Shareholder Representative expressly agrees in writing that as between the
Seller Indemnifying Party and Buyer, the Seller Indemnifying Parties may only
satisfy and discharge the Third-Party Claim in accordance with the limitations
on indemnification set forth in this Agreement (the "Litigation Conditions").
Buyer may participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim which the
Shareholder Representative is defending as provided in this Section 7.5(e)
with counsel of Buyers choice and at its expense. If the Shareholder
Representative does not assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim in
accordance with this Section 7.5(e), or any of the Litigation Conditions is
not satisfied, then Buyer shall have the right to control such defense. If the
Shareholder Representative has assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim
as provided in this Section 7.5(e), Buyer shall not be entitled to be
reimbursed from the General Escrow Fund or the Special Escrow fund, as
applicable, for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by Buyer in
connection with the defense of the Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that
if (i) any of the Litigation Conditions is not met or ceases to be met or (ii)
the Shareholder Representative fails to take reasonable steps necessary to
defend diligently such Third-Party Claim or abandons the defense of such
Third-Party Claim, Buyer may assume its own defense and the Buyer may make a
demand against the General Escrow Fund or, in the case of a Third-Party Claim
relating to a Shareholder Ownership Representation or Option Holder Option
Representation, against the Special Escrow Fund, for all reasonable costs or
expenses paid or incurred in connection with such defense. The party
controlling the defense of such Third-Party Claim shall keep the other party
advised of the status of such Third-Party Claim and the defense thereof and
shall consider in good faith the recommendations made by the other party with
respect thereto. Neither Buyer nor the Shareholder Representative shall have
the right to settle any Third-Party Claim without the consent of the other,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided,
however, that the consent of the Buyer shall not be required if (x) any
amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or compromise do not exceed the
amount in the applicable Escrow Fund, (y) such settlement includes a complete
written release of the Buyer from all liability with respect to such Third-
Party Claim and does not impose any injunctive or equitable relief or other
operational restrictions on the Buyer, and (iii) is not reasonably expected to
have an adverse effect on the affected business of the Buyer Parties; and, in
case of any such settlement, the Shareholder Representative shall execute and
deliver a memorandum to the Escrow Agent indicating the amount of such
settlement, provided, however, that no settlement of any such Third-Party
Claim shall be determinative of the amount payable in respect of any
Indemnification Claim against the Escrow Account. The parties agree to
cooperate fully with each other in connection with the defense, negotiation or
settlement of any such legal proceeding, claim or demand. In the event that
the Shareholder Representative has consented to settlement of a Third-Party
Claim pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7.5(e),  



 

\- 77 -  neither the Shareholder Representative nor the Seller Indemnifying Parties
shall have the power or authority to object to the amount of the Loss for
which Buyer may assert an Indemnification Claim against the Escrow Account.

(f) _Claims by Shareholders_. In the event that any of the Seller Parties
have an Indemnification Claim against a Buyer Party hereunder (a "Seller
Indemnification Claim"), the Shareholder Representative shall promptly notify
Buyer in writing of such claim (a "Seller Claims Notice") specifying the
nature of such Seller Indemnification Claim and the amount or the estimated
amount thereof to the extent then feasible (which estimate shall not be
conclusive of the final amount of such Seller Indemnification Claim). If the
Buyer does not notify the Shareholder Representative within thirty (30) days
of receipt of such notice that Buyer disputes such Indemnification Claim, the
amount of such claim shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the
Buyer Parties hereunder and shall be paid by Buyer, within ten (10) days
thereafter, to the Escrow Agent for prompt distribution to the Seller Parties
in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Equity Percentages. In case an
objection is made in writing in accordance with this Section 7.5(f) by the
Buyer, the Shareholder Representative shall have ten (10) days to respond in a
written statement to the objection of the Buyer. If after such ten (10)-day
period there remains a dispute as to any Indemnification Claim made by the
Shareholder Representative, the parties shall attempt in good faith for thirty
(30) days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to
each of such claims. If the parties should so agree, the amount which it has
been agreed is due the Seller Parties by Buyer, if any, shall be set forth in
a memorandum signed by the Buyer and Seller Representative and, within ten
(10) days thereafter, Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent the amount due
by it to the Seller Parties pursuant to such agreement, together with a copy
of the memorandum, for prompt distribution to the Seller Parties in proportion
to their respective Pro Rata Equity Percentages. If no such agreement can be
reached after good faith negotiation, Buyer and the Shareholder Representative
may select an arbitrator to settle such dispute in the same manner set forth
in Section 7.5(d)(ii) above. The arbitrator shall set a limited time period
and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery
while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of
the arbitrator to discover relevant information from the opposing parties
about the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator shall rule upon
motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose
sanctions, including attorneys fees and costs, to the extent as a court of
competent law or equity, should the arbitrator determine that discovery was
sought without substantial justification or that discovery was refused or
objected to without substantial justification. The decision of the arbitrator
as to the validity and amount of any such claim shall be binding
and conclusive upon the Buyer and the Shareholder Representative. Any
judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered, and
expenses allocated, as set forth in Section 7.5(d)(iii). If the arbitrators
decision provides that a payment is required to be made by Buyer to the
Seller Parties, then such payment shall be made within ten (10) days
thereafter to the Shareholder Representative for distribution to the Seller
Parties in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Equity Percentages.

Section 7.6 _Remedies_.

Except as otherwise set forth in Section 7.3(c)(i) and Section 7.3(c)(ii)
hereof or in Section 9.2 below, the rights and remedies of Buyer, Merger Sub
and the Buyer Parties for any breach of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
or any Company Closing Instrument, including the right to  



 

\- 78 -  recover money damages for or in respect of any Indemnified Losses incurred
by any of them, shall be limited solely and exclusively to making claims
against and recovering those of such Indemnified Losses determined to be due
them from the General Escrow Fund or the Special Escrow Fund, as applicable,
in accordance with this Article VII and the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything in this Article VII to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement, however, shall limit any right or remedy for any non-monetary
equitable remedy, including a preliminary or permanent injunction or specific
performance. It is also agreed that if a Shareholder Party breaches any of
its obligations or covenants under Section 5.12, Buyers recourse therefor,
whether for money damages or equitable remedies or relief, shall be limited
solely to the Shareholder Party that has committed such breach and Buyer
shall have no rights to or remedies therefor against any of the other Seller
Parties, the Escrow Account or the Company.

Closing Date; provided that Buyer shall afford the Shareholder Representative
the opportunity to review and comment on all Tax Returns relating to Pre-
Closing Tax Periods prior to filing such Tax Returns. Buyer shall not file any
amended Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior
written consent of the Shareholder Representative unless otherwise required
under relevant Tax Law.



 

79 Section 8.3 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_.

compliance with all agreements and conditions contained herein on its part to
be performed or complied with, including the fees, expenses and disbursements
of its counsel, its auditors and its actuaries.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Article IX, this
Agreement will forthwith become null and void, and no party hereto shall have
any liability or obligation, of any kind or nature whatsoever, to any other
party hereto by reason of such a termination or for any of the events or
circumstances that gave rise thereto, provided, however, that (i) the
provisions of this Article IX, the entirety of Article XI and the rights of
the Company and the obligations of Buyer under the Buyer Confidentiality
Agreement, shall survive and shall continue in full force and effect
notwithstanding termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, and
(ii) if the termination hereof is the result of an Intentional Breach (as
hereinafter defined) of this Agreement, then, (A) in the event that
such Intentional Breach was committed by the Company or any of the
Shareholder Parties (a "Company Intentional Breach"), the Company shall remain
liable for, and Buyer shall be entitled to recover from the Company, any
damages, losses, costs and expenses incurred or suffered by Buyer or Merger
Sub by reason of such Company Intentional Breach, or (B) in the event that
such Intentional Breach was committed by Buyer or Merger Sub (a "Buyer
Intentional Breach"), then, Buyer shall remain liable for, and the Company
and the Shareholder Parties shall be entitled to recover from Buyer, any
damages, losses, costs and expenses incurred or suffered by the Company or any
of the Shareholder Parties, by reason of such Buyer Intentional Breach. For
purposes hereof, an "Intentional Breach" shall mean a willful and knowing
breach by a party of any of its material representations, warranties,
agreements or covenants set forth in this Agreement. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary that may be set forth elsewhere
in this Agreement, including in this Article IX, in no event and under no
circumstance shall any officer, director, shareholder, employee or independent
contractor of any party hereto, including any Shareholder Party, have any
liability whatsoever to any other party hereto by reason of any termination of
this Agreement or the action, events, occurrences or circumstances that
caused this Agreement to be terminated.

_SHAREHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE AND ESCROW AGENT_

Section 10.1 _The Shareholders, Option Holders and the Shareholder
Representative_.

(a) Any provision in this Agreement that grants rights or remedies to the
Shareholders and Option Holders shall be deemed to be for the joint and
several benefit of the Shareholders and Option Holders, unless otherwise
specifically provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing following the Closing,
Buyer, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
conclusively rely as to any obligation they may have hereunder to the
Shareholders or Option Holders upon any written instruction, waiver, notice,
request, demand or other communication delivered by or on behalf of the
Shareholders or Option Holders by the Shareholder Representative. 



 

\- 82 - (b) Following the Closing, the Shareholder Representative shall have full
power and authority to make all decisions on behalf of the Shareholders and
Option Holders relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
All such post-closing decisions and actions by the Shareholder Representative
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and with
respect to Indemnification Claims that may be asserted by any of the Buyer
Parties or on behalf of the Seller Parties, pursuant to Article VII hereof,
including with respect to the acceptance of, objection to or settlement or
other resolution of any such Claims, including the execution of any instrument
directing the Escrow Agent to pay any portion of the Escrow Funds to the Buyer
in payment of any Losses with respect to which it has been determined
that the Buyer Parties are entitled to indemnification under Article VII
hereof, shall be binding upon all Shareholders and Option Holders and no
Shareholder or Option Holder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest
or otherwise contest the same. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, as a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement, and
as a condition to the receipt of any of the Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to this Agreement by any Shareholder or Option Holder, such
Shareholder or Option Holder shall irrevocably constitute and appoint the
Shareholder Representative as such Shareholders or Option Holders true and
lawful agent and attorney-in-fact, with full powers of substitution, to act
in the name, place and stead of such Shareholder or such Option Holder (as the
case may be), from and after the Effective Time, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement and the matters described above in
this Section 10.1, such appointment to be a power coupled with an interest
which shall survive the death or incapacity of such Shareholder or Option
Holder. Each Letter of Transmittal to be executed delivered by any Shareholder
as a condition to the receipt of such Shareholders Pro Rata Interest in the
Merger Consideration, and each Option Payout Agreement to be executed
delivered by any Option Holder as a condition to the receipt of the Option
Holder Payment Amount to which he or she shall be entitled hereunder, shall
contain provisions (i) mutually acceptable to the Buyer and Shareholder
Representative (i) irrevocably appointing the Shareholder Representative as
the lawful agent and attorney-in-fact of such Shareholder or Option Holder,
as the case may be, for the purposes set forth in this Section 10.1(b), (ii)
authorizing Buyer and Merger Sub to rely on all acts, decisions and
communications taken or made by the Shareholder Representative after the
Effective Time on behalf of such Shareholder or Option Holder, as the case may
be, pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, the related agreements
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and (iii) providing
for the Shareholder Representative to be indemnified from and against any and
all Losses and costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys and
accountants fees and disbursements) that he may incur or become subject to in
connection with the performance of the Shareholder Representatives
responsibilities as Shareholder Representative or as a result of any acts or
omissions to act taken, and any and all decisions made, by him in his capacity
as Shareholder Representative, with such indemnification to be paid first and
satisfied from the Shareholder Representative Expense Fund.

Section 10.2 _Escrow Agent and Agreement_.

(a) The Company, Buyer and Merger Sub hereby agree that the Escrow Agent shall
serve as an escrow agent to receive, hold, administer, and deliver the Escrow
Funds and the proceeds thereunder in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. Any
interest accruing on, and other earnings on investment of, the Escrow Funds
shall be deemed to be a part of the Escrow Funds. Shareholders and Option
Holders shall include all amounts earned on the Escrow Funds  



 

\- 83 -  in their gross incomes for federal, state and local income tax purposes and
pay any income tax imposed thereon. Any loss or expense incurred as a result
of an investment will be borne by the Escrow Funds. The parties recognize and
agree that the Escrow Agent will not provide supervision, recommendations or
advice relating to either the investment of the Escrow Funds or the purchase,
sale, retention or other disposition of any investment. The Escrow Agreement
will direct the Escrow Agent to send statements to each of the Buyer and the
Shareholder Representative on a monthly basis reflecting activity in the
Escrow Account for the preceding month. 

(b) All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties shall be paid
by Buyer in accordance with the standard fee schedule of the Escrow Agent. In
the event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or
if the Escrow Agent renders any service not contemplated by this Agreement, or
if the parties request a substantial modification of the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, or if any controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a
party to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to the Escrow Fund or
its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably compensated for such
extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs, attorneys fees,
including allocated costs of in-house counsel, and occasioned by such default,
delay, controversy or litigation ("Special Escrow Agent Costs"). Buyer
promises to pay these sums upon demand. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary stated herein, the Shareholders and Option Holders, and not the
Buyer, shall be responsible for all Special Escrow Agent Costs that are
incurred by the Escrow Agent as a result of a situation or dispute in which
it is determined that the Shareholders or Option Holders were chiefly at
fault.

ARTICLE X I _ _

District of Delaware and of any Delaware state court for purposes of all legal

inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the successors and permitted
assigns of the Company, Buyer, Merger Sub and/or the Surviving Corporation.

agreement among the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated
herein and supersede all previous negotiations, commitments and writings.

\- 86 -  construed to be a waiver of any such breach or default, or any acquiescence

The Table of Contents and the Section, Article and other headings contained in
this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

Section 11.11 _Specific Performance_.

The parties acknowledge and agree that any breach of the terms of this
Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for which money damages would
not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly, the parties agree that, in addition
to any other remedies, each shall be entitled to enforce the terms of this
Agreement by a decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving
the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy.

Section 11.12 _No Guarantee of Employment_.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in Section 3.25(b)
shall be a guarantee of employment. Employment with the Surviving Corporation
is based on an at-will employment relationship. Furthermore, this Agreement
is not an employment contract and nothing contained herein will confer any
additional rights to the employees named in Section 3.25(b).

Section 11.13 _Conflict Waiver_.

If the Shareholders, the Shareholder Parties or the
Shareholder Representative so desire, and without the need for any consent or
waiver by the Company or the Buyer, Stradling Yocca Carlson and Rauth ("SYCR")
shall be permitted to represent the Shareholders, the Shareholder Parties
and/or the Shareholder Representative after the Closing in connection with
any matter, including without limitation anything related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any disagreement or dispute relating
thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the Closing,
SYCR shall be permitted to represent the Shareholders, the Shareholder
Parties, the Shareholder Representative, any of their agents and affiliates,
or any one or more of them, in connection with any negotiation, transaction
or dispute ("dispute" includes litigation, arbitration or other adversary
proceeding) with Buyer, the Company or any of their agents or affiliates under
or relating to this Agreement, any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, and any related matter, such as claims for indemnification and
disputes involving employment or noncompetition or other agreements entered
into in connection with this Agreement. Upon and  



 

\- 87 -  after the Closing, the Company shall cease to have any attorney-client
relationship with SYCR, unless SYCR is specifically engaged in writing by the
Company to represent the Company after Closing and either such engagement
involves no conflict of interest with respect to Shareholders, the Shareholder
Parties or the Shareholder Representative, or the Shareholders, the
Shareholder Parties, or the Shareholder Representative (as applicable)
consent in writing at the time to such engagement. Any such representation of
the Company by SYCR after Closing shall not affect the foregoing provisions
hereof. For example, and not by way of limitation, even if SYCR is
representing the Company after the Closing, SYCR shall be permitted
simultaneously to represent the Shareholders, the Shareholder Parties and/or
the Shareholder Representative in any matter, including any disagreement or
dispute relating thereto. Furthermore, SYCR shall be permitted to withdraw
from any representation of the Company in order to be able to represent or
continue so representing the Shareholders, the Shareholder Parties or the
Shareholder Representative, even if such withdrawal causes the Company or
Buyer additional legal expense (such as to bring new counsel "up to speed"),
delay or other prejudice.
