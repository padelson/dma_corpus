iv SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

THIS SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of April 5,
2016, is made by and among Halyard Health, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
" _Purchaser_ "), Medsystems Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), and Medsystems Holdings, LLC (the " _Seller_ "). Capitalized
terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in
_Article X_ below.

WHEREAS, the Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
the Company, which consists of Common Stock (collectively, the " _Shares_ ");

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Purchaser
desires to purchase from the Seller, and the Seller desires to sell to the
Purchaser, all of the Shares;

 

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the Purchaser
and the Seller and certain equityholders of Seller have entered into
Restrictive Covenant Agreements to become effective upon the Closing (the "
_Restrictive Covenant Agreements_ "); and

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE SHARES

 

1.01 _Basic Transaction_. On and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, the Purchaser agrees to purchase from the Seller,
and the Seller agrees to sell to the Purchaser, all of the Shares owned by the
Seller for the consideration specified below in this _Article I_.

 

1.02 _Purchase and Sale of Shares_.

 

(a) _Estimated Purchase Price_. The " _Estimated Purchase Price_ " shall mean
(i) $174,000,000, _plus_ (ii) the amount by which Estimated Net Working
Capital exceeds Target Working Capital (or _minus_ the amount by which Target
Working Capital exceeds Estimated Net Working Capital), _plus_ (iii) the total
amount of Estimated Cash on Hand,  _minus_ (iv) the outstanding amount of
Estimated Indebtedness, _minus_ (v) the amount of Estimated Seller Expenses.

(b)  _Purchase and Sale of Shares_. At the Closing, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Seller shall sell,
assign, transfer and convey to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase
and acquire from the Seller, all of the Shares for and in consideration of
the Purchase Price, subject to the adjustments and payable in such amounts and
at such times as provided herein. 1.03 _The Closing_.

 

(a) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP located
at 300 North LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois at 10:00 a.m. on the second
business day following full satisfaction or due waiver of all of the closing
conditions set forth in _Article II_ hereof (other than those to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of those conditions) or on
such other date as is mutually agreeable to the Purchaser and the Seller;
provided, that the Closing shall not occur prior to May 1, 2016. The date and
time of the Closing are referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." By mutual
agreement of the parties, the Closing may take place by conference call and
electronic (i.e., email/pdf) or facsimile delivery, with exchange of original
signatures to follow by overnight mail.

1.04 _The Closing Transactions_. Subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto shall consummate the following
transactions (the " _Closing Transactions_ ") on the Closing Date:

 

(i) the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser all of the stock certificates
evidencing the Shares, duly endorsed for transfer or accompanied by duly
executed stock powers or other forms of assignment and transfer;

(ii) the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller the Estimated Purchase Price
(less the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Seller Holdback Amount) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by the
Seller (which account(s) shall be designated by the Seller to the Purchaser
in writing at least two business days before the Closing Date);

(iii) the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser appropriate payoff letters
from the holders of Indebtedness set forth on the _Indebtedness Payoff
Schedule_ and shall make arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser
for such holders of such Indebtedness set forth on the _Indebtedness Payoff
Schedule_ to deliver all related Lien releases to the Purchaser as soon as
practicable after the Closing;

 

(iv) the Purchaser shall, in accordance with the payoff letters, repay, or
cause to be repaid, on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, all
amounts necessary to discharge fully the then outstanding balance of the
Indebtedness set forth on the _Indebtedness Payoff Schedule_ , by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s) designated by the
holders of such Indebtedness;

(v) the Purchaser shall deliver the Indemnity Escrow Amount by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the Escrow Agent;

(vi) the Purchaser shall deliver the Seller Holdback Amount by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to the Seller; and

(vii) the Purchaser and the Seller shall make such other deliveries as
are required by _Article II_ hereof.

 



2 1.05 _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

 

(a) At least two business days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to the Purchaser (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and
its Subsidiaries estimated as of the Closing Date and (ii) a statement showing
the Companys good faith estimate of Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Net
Working Capital_ "), Cash on Hand (the " _Estimated Cash on Hand_ "),
Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ ") and Seller Expenses that are
unpaid as of the Closing (the " _Estimated Seller Expenses_ ") and the
resulting calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price as set forth in
_Section 1.02(a)_. The Estimated Purchase Price shall be prepared using the
accounting principles set forth on the Statement of Accounting Principles set
forth on _Schedule 1.05_. A sample calculation of the Estimated Purchase
Price as if the Closing Date had occurred on December 31, 2015 is set forth on
_Schedule 1.05_.

(b) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser will deliver to the
Seller (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and (ii) a statement
showing the Purchasers calculation of Net Working Capital, Cash on Hand,
Indebtedness and Seller Expenses (together with the Closing Balance Sheet, the
" _Preliminary Closing Statement_ ") and the resulting calculation of the
Purchase Price. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared using the
accounting principles set forth on the Statement of Accounting Principles set
forth on _Schedule 1.05_. The parties agree that the purpose of preparing the
Closing Balance Sheet and determining Net Working Capital, Cash on Hand,
Indebtedness and Seller Expenses and the related purchase price adjustments
contemplated by this _Section 1.05(b)_ is to measure the difference between
the Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Cash on Hand, Estimated
Indebtedness and Estimated Seller Expenses, on the one hand, and the actual
Net Working Capital, Cash on Hand, Indebtedness and Seller Expenses, on the
other hand, and such processes are not intended to permit the introduction of
different accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures,
classifications or estimation methodologies as those set forth on the
Statement of Accounting Principles is set forth on _Schedule 1.05_.
After delivery of the Preliminary Closing Statement, the Purchaser shall give
the Seller and its accountants reasonable access to review the Purchasers,
the Companys and its Subsidiaries books and records and work papers related
to the preparation of the Preliminary Closing Statement. The Seller and its
accountants may make inquiries of the Purchaser and the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective accountants regarding questions concerning
or disagreements with the Preliminary Closing Statement arising in the course
of its review thereof, and the Purchaser shall use its, and shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any such accountants to cooperate with and promptly respond to such
inquiries. If, after using commercially reasonable efforts to review such
books and records and work papers and to make such inquiries, the Seller has
any good faith objections to the Preliminary Closing Statement, the Seller
shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement setting forth its good faith
objections thereto (an " _Objections Statement_ "). If an Objections Statement
is not delivered to the Purchaser within 45 days after delivery of the
Preliminary Closing Statement, the Preliminary Closing Statement shall be
final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. The Seller and the
Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections, but
if they do not reach a final resolution within 30 days after the delivery of
the Objections Statement, the Seller and the Purchaser shall submit such
dispute to Grant Thornton LLP or such other mutually acceptable dispute
resolution firm (the " _Dispute Resolution Firm_ "). Any further submissions
to the Dispute Resolution Firm must be written and delivered to each party to
the dispute. The Dispute Resolution Firm shall consider only those items and
amounts which are identified in the Objections Statement as being items which
the

 



3  Seller and the Purchaser are unable to resolve. The Dispute Resolution
Firms determination will be based solely on the definitions of Net Working
Capital, Cash on Hand, Indebtedness and Seller Expenses, as applicable,
contained in this Agreement and calculated using the Statement of Accounting
Principles set forth on _Schedule 1.05_. The Seller and the Purchaser shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution
Firm to resolve all disagreements as soon as practicable and in any event
within 60 days after the submission of any dispute. Further, the Dispute
Resolution Firms determination shall be based solely on the submissions by
the Purchaser and the Seller which are in accordance with the terms and
procedures set forth in this Agreement and the Statement of Accounting
Principles set forth on _Schedule 1.05_ (i.e., not on the basis of an
independent review). The resolution of the dispute by the Dispute Resolution
Firm shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the parties hereto, and any
party may seek to enforce such decision in a court of competent jurisdiction.
The costs and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Firm shall be allocated
between the Purchaser and the Seller based upon the percentage which the
portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount
actually contested in the presentation to the Dispute Resolution Firm. For
example, if the Seller submits an Objections Statement for $1,000, and if the
Purchaser contests only $500 of the amount claimed by the Seller, and if the
Dispute Resolution Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the
Seller $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of the Dispute
Resolution Firm will be allocated 60% (i.e. 300/500) to the Purchaser and 40%
(i.e., 200/500) to the Seller.

 

For purposes hereof, " _Purchase Price_ " means an aggregate amount equal to
(i) $174,000,000, _plus_ (ii) the amount by which Net Working Capital exceeds
Target Working Capital (or _minus_ the amount by which Target Working Capital
exceeds Net Working Capital), _plus_ (iii) the total amount of Cash on Hand,
_minus_ (iv) the outstanding amount of Indebtedness, _minus_ (v) the amount
of Seller Expenses that are unpaid as of the Closing, and " _Final Purchase
Price_ " means the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 1.05(b)_ , as applicable.

 

(c) _Post-Closing Adjustment Payment_.

 

(i) If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase Price,
the Purchaser shall promptly (but in any event within five business days
after the determination of the Final Purchase Price) deliver to the Seller the
amount of such excess, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated by the Seller.

 

(ii) If the Final Purchase Price is less than the Estimated Purchase Price,
the Seller shall promptly (but in any event within five business days after
the determination of the Final Purchase Price) pay the Purchaser the amount of
such shortfall, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated by the Purchaser. At any time in its sole discretion,
the Purchaser may collect the amount of such shortfall from the Indemnity
Escrow Account

(d) This _Section 1.05_ is not intended to be used to adjust for errors or
omissions that may be found with respect to the Latest Balance Sheet or any
other balance sheet referenced in _Section 3.05_ or any inconsistencies
between the Latest Balance Sheet or any other balance sheet referenced in
_Section 3.05_ and GAAP.

 



4 1.06 _Withholding Rights_. The Purchaser shall be entitled to withhold and
deduct from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of Law; _provided_
_that_ , if the Purchaser or its designee determines that an amount is
required to be deducted and withheld, at least five business days prior to the
date the applicable payment is scheduled to be made, the Purchaser shall
provide the Seller with written notice of the intent to deduct and withhold,
which shall include a copy of the calculation of the amount to be deducted and
withheld and, to the extent practicable, provide the Seller a reasonable
opportunity for it to provide forms or other evidence that would exempt
such amounts from withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding were made.

and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to avoid, resist, resolve or, if
necessary, defend such suit or action and shall use reasonable best efforts to
take any steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Law that may be asserted by
any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date). The Company and
Seller shall coordinate and cooperate with the Purchaser in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as the Purchaser may reasonably
request in connection with all of the foregoing.

 

(b) The Company and Seller shall promptly notify the Purchaser of any
communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with any

relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including

receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any

Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to which any such filings have
been made, then the Company and Seller shall use their reasonable best efforts
to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after

30   _Section 2.01(c)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 5.03(b)_ , materials provided to the Purchaser or its outside counsel
may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning valuation, (ii) as
necessary (based on the advice of outside legal counsel) to protect reasonable
attorney-client or other legal privilege, or (iii) as required by applicable
Law. Any such disclosures, rights to participate or provisions of information
may be made on a counsel-only basis to the extent required under applicable
Law or as appropriate to protect confidential business information.

 

(c) Neither the Company nor Seller shall: (i) directly or indirectly acquire
or agree to acquire (by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner),
any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets, if the entering into a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of, such acquisition, merger or consolidation could reasonably
be expected to (A) impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or
materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any permits, orders or other
approvals of any Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting period, (B) materially increase the risk of any
Governmental Authority seeking an order prohibiting the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, (C) increase the risk of not being able
to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise, or (D) delay or prevent the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(d) Neither the Company nor Seller shall extend (or take any action that would

comparable period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Authority not to consummate the Transaction, except with the

unreasonably withheld or delayed.

5.04 _Conditions_. The Company and Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the conditions set forth in _Section 2.01_ to be satisfied
and to consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon as reasonably
possible after the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article II_
(other than those to be satisfied at the Closing).

5.05 _Notification_. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company
shall disclose to the Purchaser in writing its knowledge of any material
breach of the representations and warranties contained in _Article III_ , and
of any other fact or event that would cause or constitute a material breach of
any of the covenants in this Agreement made by the Seller or the Company, in
each case, reasonably promptly in light of the circumstances upon discovery
thereof. The Company may, from time to time prior to the Closing, by notice in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, supplement or amend
any Disclosure Schedule in order to add information relating to or resulting
from facts or events occurring subsequent to the execution of this Agreement
(a " _Schedule Supplement_ "). In the event that the Company provides
any Schedule Supplement, the matters set forth on such Schedule Supplement
shall not be effective to cure and correct for purposes of _Article II_ any
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant which would have existed if
the Company had not provided such Schedule Supplement. In the event that
prior to the Closing Date the Company provides to the Purchaser notification
pursuant to the terms of this _Section 5.05_ of the failure of any condition
in _Article II_ as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant of the Company and/or the

 



31  Seller due to facts or events occurring subsequent to the execution of this
Agreement that, but for this _Section 5.05_ , would entitle the Purchaser not
to consummate the Closing (a " _Company Termination Update_ "), the Purchaser
may terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01_. If the
Purchaser consummates the Closing after receiving a Company Termination
Update, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights,
remedies or other recourse against the Company and/or the Seller to which the
Purchaser might otherwise be entitled in respect of the breach set forth in
such Company Termination Update, including any rights or remedies under
_Article VII_ , and such Company Termination Update shall be effective to cure
and correct for all other purposes any such breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant which would have existed if the Company had not provided
such Company Termination Update. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event
shall any matter set forth on a Company Termination Update have any impact on
any rights, remedies or other recourse of the Purchaser under
_Sections 7.02(a)(iii)_ , _(iv)_ or _(v)_. All references to any Disclosure
Schedule hereto which is supplemented or amended as provided in this _Section
5.05_ shall for all purposes after the Closing be deemed to be a reference to
such Disclosure Schedule as so supplemented or amended. If the Purchaser
consummates the Closing after receiving any Schedule Supplement that is not a
Company Termination Update, the Purchaser shall be entitled to exercise any
rights or remedies pursuant to this Agreement in respect of a breach that
would be cured by such Schedule Supplement, including any rights or remedies
under _Article VII_ , and such Schedule Supplement shall not be effective to
cure and correct for any purpose any such breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant which would have existed if the Company had not provided
such Schedule Supplement.

 

5.06 _Exclusive Dealing_. During the period from the date of this Agreement
through the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01_ , neither the Company nor the Seller shall take, nor shall they
permit any of their Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
representatives, consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants
or other agents to take, any action to solicit, encourage, initiate or engage
in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to or enter
into any agreement with any Person (other than Purchaser and/or its
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, representatives, consultants,
financial advisors, financing sources, attorneys, accountants and other
agents) concerning any purchase of any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries
equity securities or any merger, sale of assets outside of the ordinary
course of business, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, reclassification or similar transaction involving or
relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries (each such
acquisition transaction, an " _Acquisition Transaction_ "), and the Company
and the Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, representatives, consultants, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants and other agents to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions, negotiations and other communications
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any such Acquisition
Transaction. The Seller and the Company shall promptly notify the Purchaser
if any Person makes any proposal, offer, inquiry or contact with respect to
any Acquisition Transaction, together with the material details of such
proposal, offer, inquiry or contact.

 

5.07 _Interim Financial Information_. Within thirty (30) days after the last
day of each month prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to the
Purchaser an unaudited comparative consolidated balance sheet as of the last
day of such month and unaudited

 



32  comparative consolidated statements of income for such month, in each case
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, excluding The Factory, Factory Control,
TMS (Tunis Medical Services), Maxter Catheters SAS and ENTRAL SAS.

5.08 _Benefit Plan Terminations_. If, no later than 10 days prior to Closing,
Purchaser requests that the Company terminate any Plans, the Company shall
take such actions as are reasonably necessary to terminate those Plans that
Purchaser requests to be terminated, subject to the terms of each Plan and the
requirements of applicable Law, which terminations may be conditioned upon
the Closing. No later than the day immediately prior to the Closing, the
Company shall provide evidence that the Board of Directors of the Company has
terminated each such Plan (if any) pursuant to resolutions adopted by the
Board of Directors, and which terminations may be conditioned upon the
Closing. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the
review and approval of Purchaser (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Purchaser shall promptly reimburse the
Company for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in terminating such
Plans as requested by Purchaser prior to Closing.

 

ARTICLE VI

COVENANTS OF THE PURCHASER

6.01 _Access to Books and Records_. For five (5) years after the Closing, the
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide
the Seller and its authorized representatives with reasonable access, during
normal business hours, to the books and records and personnel of the Company
and its Subsidiaries in connection with any matter relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or with respect to
periods or occurrences prior to or on the Closing Date, including, without
limitation, for the purpose of preparing Tax Returns and providing assistance
relating to final accounting functions relating to the Company. Unless
otherwise consented to in writing by the Seller, the Purchaser shall not, and
shall not permit the Company or its Subsidiaries to, for a period of seven (7)
years following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any
of the books and records of the Company or its Subsidiaries (relating to the
Business) for any period prior to the Closing Date without first giving
reasonable prior notice to the Seller and offering to surrender to the Seller
Representative such books and records or any portion thereof which the
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries may intend to destroy, alter or dispose
of.

 

6.02 _Notification_. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall disclose to the Company in writing its knowledge of any
material breach of the representations and warranties contained in _Article
IV_ as applicable, and of any other fact or event that would cause or
constitute a material breach of the covenants in this Agreement made by the
Purchaser, in each case, reasonably promptly in light of the circumstances
upon discovery thereof. The Purchaser may, from time to time prior to the
Closing, by notice in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, provide a
Schedule Supplement in order to add information relating to or resulting from
facts or events occurring subsequent to the execution of this Agreement. In
the event that the Purchaser provides any Schedule Supplement, the matters set
forth on such Schedule Supplement shall not be effective to cure and correct
for purposes of _Article II_ any breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant which would have existed if the Purchaser had not provided such
Schedule Supplement. In the event that prior to the Closing Date the

 



33  Purchaser provides to the Seller notification pursuant to the terms of this
_Section 6.02_ of the failure of any condition in _Article II_ as a result of
any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of the Purchaser due
to facts or events occurring subsequent to the execution of this Agreement
that, but for this _Section 6.02_ , would entitle the Seller not to consummate
the Closing (a " _Purchaser Termination Update_ "), the Company and the
Seller may terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01_. If the
Seller consummates the Closing after receiving a Purchaser Termination Update,
the Seller shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights, remedies or
other recourse against the Purchaser to which the Seller might otherwise be
entitled in respect of the breach set forth in such Purchaser Termination
Update, including any rights or remedies under  _Article VII_ , and such
Purchaser Termination Update shall be effective to cure and correct for all
other purposes any such breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
which would have existed if the Purchaser had not provided such Purchaser
Termination Update. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any
matter set forth on a Purchaser Termination Update have any impact on any
rights, remedies or other recourse of Seller under _Section 7.03(b)_. All
references to any Disclosure Schedule hereto which is supplemented or amended
as provided in this _Section 6.02_ shall for all purposes after the Closing be
deemed to be a reference to such Disclosure Schedule as so supplemented or
amended. If the Seller consummates the Closing after receiving any Schedule
Supplement that is not a Purchaser Termination Update, the Seller shall be
entitled to exercise any rights or remedies pursuant to this Agreement in
respect of the breach that would be cured by such Schedule Supplement,
including any rights or remedies under _Article VII_ , and such Schedule
Supplement shall not be effective to cure and correct for any purpose any such
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant which would have existed
if the Purchaser had not provided such Schedule Supplement.

6.03 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_. For a period of
six years after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall not, and shall not
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, repeal or modify any
provision in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries articles of
incorporation or bylaws relating to the exculpation or indemnification of any
current or former officer or director (the " _D andO Indemnified Persons_")
(unless required by Law), it being the intent of the parties that the DandO
Indemnified Persons shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification to the fullest extent of the Law. At the Closing, the
Purchaser will, or will cause the Company to, obtain, maintain and fully pay
for, at the Sellers sole expense, irrevocable " _tail_ " insurance policies
naming the DandO Indemnified Persons as direct beneficiaries with a claims
period of at least six years from the Closing Date from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier with respect to directors liability insurance in an amount and scope
at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date. The Purchaser
will not, or will cause the Company to not, cancel or change such insurance
policies in any respect. If the Purchaser, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall
consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Purchaser and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section.
The provisions of this _Section 6.03_ are intended for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Person and his or her heirs and
representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have
had by contract or otherwise.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
will Purchaser be obligated to propose or agree to accept any undertaking or
condition, to enter into any consent decree, to make any divestiture, to

reasonable judgment of Purchaser, would be expected to have a material adverse
impact on any of its businesses, or the businesses to be acquired by it
pursuant to this Agreement, either individually or in the aggregate. With
regards to any Governmental Authority, neither the Company, the Seller nor any
of its respective affiliates shall, without Purchasers written consent (in
Purchasers sole discretion), discuss or commit to any divestiture
transaction, or discuss or commit to alter their businesses or commercial

otherwise receive the full benefits of this Agreement.

(c) None of the Parties shall: (i) directly or indirectly acquire or agree to
acquire (by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial
portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner), any Person or
portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the
entering into a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of,
such acquisition, merger or consolidation could reasonably be expected to (A)
impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk
of not obtaining, any permits, orders or other approvals of any Governmental
Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, (B) materially
increase the risk of any Governmental Authority seeking an order prohibiting
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (C) increase the
risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or otherwise, or (D)
delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(d) None of the Parties shall extend (or take any action that would reasonably
be expected to have the effect of extending) any waiting or comparable period
under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority
not to consummate the Transaction, except with the prior written consent of
the other Parties. Such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.

6.05 _Conditions_. The Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the conditions set forth in  _Section 2.02_ to be satisfied and to
consummate the transactions contemplated herein as soon as reasonably possible
after the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article II_ (other than
those to be satisfied at the Closing).

  



36 6.06 _Contact with Customers and Suppliers_. Prior to the Closing, the
Purchaser and the Purchasers Representatives shall contact and communicate
with the employees (other than the persons set forth on _Schedule 6.06_ ),
customers and suppliers of the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby only after prior consultation with and
approval of the Seller.

6.07 _Employment and Benefit Arrangements_. The Purchaser shall take all
actions required so that employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are
employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date shall
receive service credit for periods of employment with the Company and its
Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility and vesting, for purposes of
determining future vacation or paid time off accruals and for purposes of
determining severance benefits under any employee benefit plans and
arrangements in which they participate following the Closing Date. The
Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to waive any applicable
waiting periods, pre-existing conditions or actively-at-work requirements and
shall give such employees credit under the new coverages or benefit plans for
deductibles, co-insurance and out-of-pocket payments that have been paid
during the year in which the Closing Date occurs. This _Section 6.07_ shall
survive the Closing, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
the Purchaser, the Company and its Subsidiaries. During the twelve month
period following the Closing, Purchaser shall take all actions required so
that the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (determined as of
the Closing Date) that continue to be employed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries after the Closing Date receive base compensation, bonus
opportunities and benefits that, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than
that provided immediately prior to the Closing Date. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended by the parties to constitute a plan amendment or to
create any obligations of the parties with respect to any Employee Benefit
Plan.

employees or agents and their respective successors and assigns (each a "
_Purchaser Indemnified Party_ " and collectively, the " _Purchaser Indemnified
Parties_ ") resulting or arising from:

 

(i) any nonfulfillment or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,

covenants or agreements of the Company herein following the Closing or any

forth herein by the Company or the Seller or in any certificate
delivered hereunder, in each case taking into account any disclosure made
pursuant to _Section 5.05_ hereof;

(ii) any nonfulfillment or breach of any representation or warranty set forth
on _Schedule 7.02(a)(ii)_ , taking into account any disclosure made pursuant

Representations or nonfulfillment of any covenant of the Seller to be
performed following the Closing) unless and until the aggregate amount of

an amount equal to $1,305,000 (the " _R andW Deductible_"), and then only to
the extent such Losses exceed the RandW Deductible; (B) in each case no such
claims shall be asserted under _Section 7.02(a)(ii)_ or under
_Section 7.02(a)(iii)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses that

equal to $870,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent such
Losses exceed the Deductible; (C) no individual claim by the Purchaser shall
be asserted under _Section 7.02(a)(i)_ or under _Section 7.02(a)(ii)_ (other
than with respect to breaches of the Product Liability Representations or
breaches of the last sentence of _Section 3.05(a)_ ) unless and until the
aggregate amount of Losses that would be payable pursuant to such claim
exceeds an amount equal to $10,000 (the " _Mini-Basket_ "), and then from the
first dollar of such Losses (it being understood that any such individual
claims for amounts less than the Mini-Basket shall be ignored in determining
whether

 



38  the RandW Deductible or the Deductible has been exceeded and thereafter); (D)
no individual claim by the Purchaser shall be asserted under _Section
7.02(a)(ii)_ with respect to breaches of the Product Liability
Representations unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses that would be
payable pursuant to such claim exceeds an amount equal to $50,000 (the "

and thereafter); (E) no individual claim by the Purchaser shall be asserted
under _Section 7.02(a)(i)_ with respect to breaches of the last sentence of
_Section 3.05(a)_ unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses that would

than the Financial Statements Mini-Basket shall be ignored in determining
whether the RandW Deductible has been exceeded and thereafter); (F) Sellers
aggregate liability under _Section 7.02(a)(i)_ (solely from amounts available

Seller will not be liable for any Losses resulting or arising from the
termination, amendment or other modification of the Plans by or at the
direction of the Purchaser on or after the Closing Date, except to the extent
such Losses result or arise from a breach of _Section 3.13(h)_.

(b) Following the Closing, except for claims based on common law fraud with
respect to this Agreement, the indemnification from the Indemnity Escrow
Account provided by _Section 7.02(a)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
for any loss, liability, demand, claim, action, cause of action, cost,
damage, deficiency, Tax, penalty, fine or expense, whether or not arising out
of third party claims (including, without limitation, interest, penalties,
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, court costs and all reasonable
amounts paid in investigation, defense or settlement of any of the foregoing)
of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to any misrepresentation or
inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representations or warranties or any breach
or failure in performance prior to Closing of any covenants or agreements
made by the Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in this Agreement
or in any exhibit or schedules hereto or any certificate delivered hereunder
(including with respect to any environmental, health or safety matters).

(c) No claim shall be brought or maintained by any Purchaser Indemnified
Party, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective successors
or permitted assigns against any officer, director, employee (present or
former) or Affiliate of any party hereto which is not otherwise expressly
identified as a party hereto, and no recourse shall be brought or granted
against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation
or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations, warranties or
covenants of any party hereto set forth or contained in this Agreement or any
exhibit or schedule hereto or any certificate delivered hereunder, except for
claims based on fraud with respect to this Agreement.

 

(d) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no right to indemnification
hereunder with respect to any Loss to the extent such Loss is included in the
calculation of any component of Final Purchase Price.

(e) All payments pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be treated by the
parties as an adjustment to the proceeds payable to the Seller pursuant to
_Section 1.02_ hereof.

 



39 (f) (i) Except for the Purchaser pursuant to the terms hereof, no Person
(including, without limitation, the Seller or any of its Affiliates) shall
have any obligation to fund the Indemnity Escrow Account, (ii) except for the
amount to which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have, prior to the
applicable Survival Period Termination Date, previously made a claim pursuant
to the procedures set forth in _Article VII_ or _Article IX_ and for which the
obligations to indemnify, if any, shall not have been satisfied from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount (the " _Outstanding Escrow Claims_ "), title and all
rights to all funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account shall automatically
transfer to the Seller on the last applicable Survival Period Termination
Date, and (iii) the Purchaser shall take all actions reasonably necessary to
cause the Escrow Agent to release all funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account,
less the amount of the Outstanding Escrow Claims to the Seller on the
applicable Survival Period Termination Date. As soon as the Outstanding
Escrow Claims are resolved pursuant to the procedures set forth in this
_Article VII_ or _Article IX_ , as applicable, the Purchaser shall cause the
Escrow Agent to release any remaining cash held by the Escrow Agent pursuant
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement to the Seller.

(g) The Sellers obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
with respect to any environmental matter or condition shall be limited to
matters that are not instigated or prompted by a Purchaser Indemnified Party
unless affirmatively required by Environmental and Safety Requirements, and
Sellers indemnity obligation shall not apply to any environmental matter or
condition that is discovered or detected by any sampling, investigation, or
reporting by or on behalf of any Purchaser Indemnified Party that is not
affirmatively required by Environmental and Safety Requirements. Except to
the extent otherwise required of the Company or its subsidiaries under any
existing agreement with the owner of the applicable real property, the
Sellers indemnity obligation shall be limited to such cost effective action
that is required by Environmental and Safety Requirements to attain compliance
with minimum applicable remedial standards for continued commercial or
industrial use of the relevant property or facility, employing where
applicable risk-based remedial standards and institutional controls, where
such standards or controls would not unreasonably interfere with ongoing
commercial or industrial operations at the relevant property or facility.

 

7.03 _Indemnification by the Purchaser for the Benefit of the Seller_. From
and after the Closing (but subject to the provisions of this  _Article VII_
), the Seller shall be entitled to assert, as its sole and exclusive remedy
for any action relating (directly or indirectly) to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and only in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, claims against the Purchaser in respect of any Loss suffered
or incurred by the Seller or any of its Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees or agents (" _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") to the extent resulting
or arising from (a) any nonfulfillment or breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision set forth herein by the
Purchaser or in any or certificate delivered hereunder, and (b) any actions
taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with _Section 5.08_ ;
provided, in each case, that in no event shall the Seller Indemnified Parties
be entitled to indemnification for amounts that exceed $17,400,000 in the
aggregate.

 

7.04 _Mitigation_. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall
take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate all Losses, costs, and
expenses as required by applicable Law.

 



40 7.05 _Defense of Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) Any Person making a claim for indemnification under _Section 7.02_ or
_Section 7.03_ (an " _Indemnitee_ ") shall notify the indemnifying party (an
" _Indemnitor_ ") of the claim in writing promptly after receiving written
notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim
against it (if by a third party), describing the claim, the amount thereof
(if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof; provided, that the failure
to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnitor is materially
prejudiced thereby. Except as provided in _Section 9.01(f)_ , any Indemnitor
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such action, lawsuit,
proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to an Indemnitees claim
for indemnification at such Indemnitors expense, and at its option (upon
providing written notice to the Indemnitee within 30 days of receiving notice
of the third party claim) shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof by
appointing a reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to be
the lead counsel in connection with such defense; provided that any Indemnitor
shall continue to be entitled to assert any limitation on any claims contained
herein; provided further the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in
the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such
purpose; provided however, that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel
shall be borne by the Indemnitee.

 

(b) The Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense and
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the
Indemnitee if (i) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation; (ii) the claim seeks an injunction or equitable or other non-
monetary relief against the Indemnitee; (iii) the Indemnitee has been advised
by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest
between the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee that would make it inappropriate in
the reasonable judgment of such counsel, that the same counsel represent both
the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor; (iv) upon petition by the Indemnitee, the
appropriate court rules that the Indemnitor failed or is failing to vigorously
prosecute or defend such claim; (v) the claim would be reasonably likely to
have a material adverse effect on the Indemnitees reputation, customer or
supplier relations or future business prospects, or (vi) the Losses relating
to such claim would reasonably be expected to result in liabilities which,
taken with other then existing Losses under this _Article VII_ , would exceed
the then-remaining limit of liability of such Indemnitor.

 

(c) If the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim then the
Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such claim; provided, that, the
Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld conditioned, or delayed) before
entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim if,
pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, injunctive or
other equitable relief will be imposed against the Indemnitee or if such
settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnitee from
all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim. If the Seller as
Indemnitor assumes the defense of and/or settles or compromises any third
party claim as provided herein and the Deductible applies to such claim and
has not been met with respect to the Indemnitors liability under _Section
7.02_ , then (i) until such time as the Deductible has been met, the
Indemnitee will promptly reimburse the Indemnitor for any reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in the 

 



41  assumption of such defense and (ii) if the settlement or compromise of such
third party claim is equal to or less than the remaining Deductible at such
time (after taking into account any reimbursements pursuant to clause (i)
above), then within five (5) business days after the settlement or compromise
of such claim, the Indemnitee shall pay to the Indemnitor the aggregate amount
of the third party claim settled or compromised up to the amount of the then
remaining Deductible. In no event will an Indemnitee consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any third party
claim for which Indemnitee is seeking an indemnification payment hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld conditioned, or delayed).

 

(d) Notwithstanding the forgoing provisions of _Section 7.05_ or anything to
the contrary contained herein, this _Section 7.05_  shall not apply with
respect to any Tax Proceeding which shall be governed by _Section 9.01(f)_.

7.06 _Determination of Loss Amount_.

(a) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under _Section 7.02_ or
_Section 7.03_ shall be calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefit actually
realized by the Indemnitee or any of their Affiliates on account of such Loss
and (ii) any insurance proceeds (net of direct collection expenses) or any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by the Indemnitee
from any third party with respect thereto. If the Indemnitee or its Affiliates
actually realizes a Tax Benefit after an indemnification payment is made to it
but prior to the date that is four years after the later of (x) the Closing
Date and (y) the date the Loss was suffered or incurred, the Indemnitee shall
promptly pay to the Indemnitor the amount of such Tax Benefit at such time or
times as and to the extent that such Tax Benefit is actually realized by
the Indemnitee. Additionally, if, in connection with the settlement of an
audit, examination or similar proceeding, a Governmental Authority adjusts any
Tax Benefit after such payment is made to the Indemnitor but prior to the date
that is four years after the later of (x) the Closing Date and (y) the date
the Loss was suffered or incurred, the Indemnitor shall promptly pay to the
Indemnitee the amount of such adjustment (but not in excess of the amount of
any such Tax Benefit so adjusted) after the Indemnitee provides notice of
such settlement of such adjustment with the Governmental Authority (together
with any supporting work papers, schedules and documents). For purposes
hereof, " _Tax Benefit_ " means the Tax savings actually realized by an
Indemnitee or its Affiliates that is attributable to any deduction, loss, or
credit, resulting from or arising out of a Loss, calculated by computing the
amount of Taxes before and after inclusion of any such Tax deduction, loss or
credit (treating such items of Tax deduction, loss or credit as the last items
claimed), and any such Tax savings shall be treated as actually realized upon
the filing the Tax Return reflecting such Tax savings. The Indemnitee shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance
policies covering any Loss to the same extent as they would if such Loss were
not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance or
other recovery is made by any Indemnitee with respect to any Loss for which
any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the
aggregate amount of the recovery (net of direct collection expenses) shall be
made promptly to the Indemnitor. If an Indemnitor makes an indemnification
payment hereunder, such Indemnitor shall be subrogated, to the extent of such
payment, to all related rights of the Indemnitees and their Affiliates in
respect of any Losses indemnified by the Indemnitors.

 



42 (b) The Purchaser shall not have any right to indemnification with respect to
Taxes and related Losses under _Section 7.02(a)_ or otherwise under this
Agreement to the extent such Taxes or related Losses (i) are attributable to
the Post-Closing Tax Period, except to the extent the Loss or Tax is
attributable to a breach of the representation in _Section 3.08(k)_ , (ii)
are due to the unavailability in the Post-Closing Tax Period of any net
operating losses, credits or other Tax attribute from the Pre-Closing Tax
Period, or (iii) result from any breach of the covenant in _Section 9.01(c)_.

(c) For the purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of a
representation or warranty, or the amount of any Loss related to a breach of
a representation or warranty, the representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement (other than the representations and warranties set forth in the
first sentence of _Section 3.06_ or any representation or warranty merely
requiring the listing of a material item) shall be considered without regard
to any materiality or "Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualification set
forth therein.

 

7.07 _Manner of Payment_. Any indemnification of the Seller Indemnified
Parties pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be effected by wire transfer of
immediately available funds from the Indemnitor to an account designated by
the Indemnitee within ten (10) days after the determination thereof.

 

7.08 _No Circular Recovery_. Under no circumstances shall Seller or any of its
Affiliates seek any contribution from, or any other recourse to or claim
against, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to Sellers
indemnification obligations hereunder and, as of the Closing, the Seller (on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereby fully and irrevocably releases,
acquits and forever discharges the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective representatives, affiliates, members, shareholders, partners,
officers, directors and employees and successors or assigns, in each case,
from any and all Losses which any Seller or its Affiliates may have after the
Closing Date related to or arising out of claims for indemnification by
Purchaser Indemnified Parties against Seller.

 

7.09 _Acknowledgment of the Purchaser; No Reliance_. Except as expressly
provided in _Article III_ , the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Seller do
not make or provide, and the Purchaser hereby waives, any warranty or
representation, express or implied, as to the quality, merchantability, as for
a particular purpose, conformity to samples, or condition of the Companys
and its Subsidiaries assets or any part thereto. In connection with the
Purchasers investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Purchaser
may have received certain projections, including projected statements of
operating revenues and income from operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and certain business plan information. The Purchaser acknowledges
that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans, that the Purchaser is familiar
with such uncertainties and that the Purchaser is taking full responsibility
for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it, including,
without limitation, the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections and forecasts. Accordingly, the Purchaser hereby
acknowledges that none of the Seller, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is making any representation or warranty with respect to such estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans, including, without limitation, the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections
and forecasts, and

 



43  that the Purchaser has not relied on any such estimates, projections or
other forecasts or plans. The Purchaser further agrees that (i) none of the
Seller, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person will have or
be subject to any liability to the Purchaser or any other Person resulting
from the distribution to the Purchaser, or the Purchasers use of, any such
estimates, projections or other forecasts or plans, and (ii) the Purchaser
has not relied on any such information, or on the omission of any such
information, including the Confidential Information Memorandum or similar
memoranda and presentations, and any other estimates, projections or
other forecasts or plans or material made available to the Purchaser or its
Affiliates in certain "data rooms," management presentations or any other form
in expectation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this agreement, neither the
Seller nor the Company makes any representation or warranty hereunder with
respect to any matter, event, transaction, agreement, act or omission
occurring or in existence prior to the Acquisition Date, and the Seller and
the Company hereby disclaim any such representation or warranty. In no event
will the Purchaser be entitled to recover or make a claim for any amounts in
respect of any matter, event, transaction, agreement, act or omission
occurring or in existence prior to the Acquisition Date.

7.10 _Fraud_. None of the limitations contained in this  _Article VII_ shall
apply to claims based on common law fraud.

part of either the Purchaser, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the
Seller to one another, except for willful breaches of the representations and
warranties as of the date made by such party in this Agreement or willful
breaches of the covenants and agreements of such party in this Agreement prior
to the time of such termination.

Subsidiaries; _provided_ _that_ , with respect to the preparation and filing
of the Tax Returns under this _Section 9.01(a)_ with respect to Income Taxes
for the period including the Closing Date, such Tax Returns shall reflect all
applicable Seller Transaction Tax Deductions that are "more likely than not"
deductible (or deductible at a higher confidence level) in the Pre-Closing
Tax Period and, for that purpose, the parties agree that 70% of the fees with
respect to agreements set forth on _Schedule 9.01(a)_ as success-based fees
for which the safe harbor election of Rev. Proc. 2011-29 is made (which
election shall be made on such Tax Returns to the extent applicable) are "more
likely than not" deductible and shall be reflected on such Tax Return. The
Purchaser will not permit the Company or any Subsidiary to waive any
carryback period with respect to Income Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
and shall carryback any item of loss, credit, or deduction to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law (using any available short-form or
accelerated procedures (including filing IRS Form 1139 and any corresponding
form for applicable state, local and foreign tax purposes) and filing amended
Tax Returns to the extent necessary). The Purchaser shall be entitled to
offset all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of preparing and
filing any Tax Return to carryback any such item to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
including the cost of any tax memorandum or opinion required in the reasonable
discretion of the Purchaser related to such Tax Return, against any refund
payable to the Seller under _Section 9.01(h)_ ; _provided_ _that_ any such
offset shall not exceed $50,000 and shall not be available with respect to
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred for any tax issues addressed in
written advice from Ernst and Young LLC that is paid for by the Seller and
received by the Purchaser or its agents prior to the date hereof. At least 30
days prior to the date on which any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including for any Straddle Period) is filed (or, if such due date is within
forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date), the Purchaser shall submit such Tax Return to the
Seller for the Sellers review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. With respect to any Tax Return for Income
Taxes required to be filed pursuant to this _Section 9.01(a)_ (including any
Tax Returns required to carryback any items), the Purchaser shall cause all
such Tax Returns to be filed by the earlier of (A) November 30, 2016, or (B)
the due date of such Tax Returns.

 

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. The Purchaser will pay, and will indemnify and hold the
Seller harmless against, any transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration
and real property transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, excise tax, stock transfer
tax, or other similar Tax imposed on the Company or the Seller as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer
Taxes_ "), and any penalties or interest with respect to the Transfer Taxes.
The Seller agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser in the filing of any returns
with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including by promptly supplying any
information in its possession that is reasonably necessary to complete such
returns.

(c) _Pre-Closing Tax Matters_. After the Closing, the Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, (i)
other than Tax Returns that are filed pursuant to _Section 9.01(a)_ , file or
amend or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (ii) after the date any Tax Return filed pursuant to _Section 9.01(a)_
is filed, amend or otherwise modify any such Tax Return, (iii) extend or
waive, or cause 

 



46  to be extended or waived, any statute of limitations or other period for the
assessment of any Tax or deficiency related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iv)
make or change any Tax election or accounting method or practice with respect
to, or that has retroactive effect to, any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (v) make
or initiate any voluntary contact with a Governmental Authority regarding
Taxes in any Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided that_ , subject to _Section
9.02_ , none of the foregoing limitations in this _Section 9.01(c)_ shall
limit the rights of the Company or its Subsidiaries from (A) registering to
collect and remit sales and use taxes for any tax period beginning after the
Closing Date and (B) filing income Tax Returns for any tax period beginning
after the Closing Date.

(d) _No Section 338 or 336 Election_. The Purchaser shall not make any
election under Code §338 or §336 (or any similar provisions under applicable
Law) with respect to the acquisition of the Company and its Affiliates.

 

(e) _Records_. At the request of the Seller, the Purchaser shall deliver to
the Seller copies of all Tax Returns relating to the tax periods (or portions
thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing prepared in accordance with
_Section 9.01(a)_.

(f) _Tax Proceedings_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the Seller shall have the sole right in its discretion and its own expense to
elect to represent the interests of the Company and its Subsidiaries in any
claim, audit, examination or administrative or court proceeding relating to
any audits or assessments or other disputes (including any settlement or
disposition thereof) (" _Tax Proceeding_ ") regarding any Taxes (or any Tax
Return filed by the Company or its Subsidiaries) with respect to Pre-Closing
Tax Periods if Purchaser is entitled to make a claim for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 7.02_ of this Agreement with respect to such Tax
Proceeding; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall also be entitled to
participate in such Tax Proceeding at its own expense. If the Seller does not
make such election, then the Purchaser shall control such Tax Proceeding. The
Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller in writing upon receiving notice
from any taxing authority of the commencement of any such Tax Proceeding, and
the Purchaser shall take all actions reasonably necessary (including providing
a power of attorney) to enable the Seller to exercise its control rights as
set forth in this _Section 9.01(f)_.

(g) _Cooperation; Seller Transaction Tax Deductions_. Purchaser, the Company
and its Subsidiaries and the Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
preparation and the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section 9.01_ and
any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes and with
respect to the voluntary disclosure process described in _Section 9.02_ (and
with respect to obtaining any applicable exemption certificates or other
documents pursuant to _Section 9.02(e)_ ) and the computation and
verification of any amounts paid or payable under this _Section 9.01_
(including any supporting work papers, schedules and documents). Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys request)
the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall
retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the
Company or its Subsidiaries relating to any tax periods and shall abide by all
record retention agreements entered

 



47  into with any Taxing authority and shall give the Seller reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and
records prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for
that tax period, and if the Seller so requests, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall allow the Seller to take possession of such books and
records rather than destroying or discarding such books and records. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, in connection with preparing the Tax
Returns with respect to Income Taxes for the period including the Closing Date
described in _Section 9.01(a)_ , (i) no later than 10 days after the Closing,
the Seller shall provide the Purchaser with information as to the individual
items of and approximate amounts of Seller Transaction Tax Deductions, and
(ii) within 60 days after Closing, the Purchaser shall provide written
notice (including any supporting work papers, schedules, memoranda, or
documents) to the Seller with respect to (A) the amount of Seller Transaction
Tax Deductions that are "more likely than not" deductible (or deductible at a
higher confidence level) in the Pre-Closing Tax Period (taking into account
the proviso in _Section 9.01(a)_ ) and (B) the amount of any Seller
Transaction Tax Deductions that, assuming payment of all amounts in accordance
with this Agreement and no indemnity claims hereunder, would be "more likely
than not" deductible (or deductible at a higher confidence level) in any Post-
Closing Tax Period (collectively, the " _Deduction Statement_ "). If the
Seller has any objection to the Deduction Statement, it shall inform the
Purchaser, in writing, within 45 days after receiving the Deduction Statement.
The Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
dispute and the deduction Statement shall be modified accordingly. If the
Seller and the Purchaser do not reach a final resolution within 90 days after
the Purchasers delivery of the Deduction Statement, the Seller and the
Purchaser shall submit any unresolved items regarding the Deduction Statement
to a mutually agreed (including mutual agreement as to any engagement letter
and any other terms and conditions of the engagement) nationally recognized
accounting firm for prompt resolution. The determination of the independent
accounting firm with respect to such matters shall be binding on all Parties
and Tax Returns shall be filed consistent with such resolution. The fees,
costs and expenses of any nationally recognized accounting firm to which such
unresolved items are submitted pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence
shall be borne one half by the Purchaser on the one hand, and one half by the
Seller, on the other hand.

 

(h) _Tax Refunds_. After the Closing Date, except to the extent (A) included
as an asset in (including to the extent such asset is taken into account as a
contra liability that reduces a liability that is taken into account in the
calculation of) Indebtedness or Net Working Capital as finally determined
hereunder, or (B) attributable to the carryback of any loss, deduction or
credit from a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller
shall be entitled to all Tax refunds (and Overpayment Credits) received by the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries
for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any Tax refunds attributable to the
carryback of items under _Section 9.01(a)_ above) to the extent attributable
to (i) Taxes paid by or on behalf the Company or the Subsidiary on or prior to
the Closing Date, (ii) Indemnified Taxes for which the Seller (including from
the Indemnity Escrow Account) has indemnified the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties hereunder, or (iii) Taxes included as a Seller Expense or Indebtedness
or as a liability in Net Working Capital (in each case, as finally determined
hereunder). Purchaser will pay over to the Seller any such Tax refund promptly
(but in all cases within five business days) after actual receipt of such Tax
refund (or, in the case of any Overpayment Credits, promptly (but in all
cases within five business days) upon filing the applicable Tax Return where
such Overpayment Credit is used to reduce Taxes otherwise

 



48  payable); _provided_ that, any such payments to the Seller be reduced by any
costs and expenses attributable to the delivery of such Tax refund (or
application of Overpayment Credits) to the Seller. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Purchaser shall request a refund (rather than a credit in
lieu of a refund) with respect to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods. For the
avoidance of doubt, any refund or credit from a Seller Transaction Tax
Deduction deductible in, or carried forward to, any Post-Closing Tax Period
shall inure to the benefit of the Purchaser.

 

(i) _Closing of Tax Periods_. The parties hereto shall, to the extent
permitted or required under applicable Law, treat the Closing Date as the
last day of the taxable period of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Tax
purposes, and the Purchaser shall cause the Company and its domestic
Subsidiaries to join the Purchasers "consolidated group" (as used in
Treasury Regulations §1.1502-76) effective on the day after the Closing Date.
The parties agree that (A) the Purchaser and its Affiliates and the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall not make an election under Treasury
Regulations §1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D) to ratably allocate items (or any make
any similar election or ratably allocate items under any corresponding
provision of applicable Law) and (B) none of the Seller Transaction Tax
Deductions are "properly allocable" to the portion of the Closing Date after
the sale of the Shares for purposes of applying the "next day" rule of
Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) and, therefore, none of the
Seller Transaction Tax Deductions shall be treated as occurring on the day
after the Closing Date under the next-day rule; _provided that_ , if the "next
day" rule in Treasury Regulation §1.1502-76 is amended prior to the filing of
the applicable Tax Return with respect to Income Taxes for the period
including the Closing Date and the effective/applicability date of such
amended next day rule is for a consolidated return year that includes such
period, then the amended "next day" rule shall be applied so that none of the
Seller Transaction Tax Deductions shall be treated as occurring on the day
after the Closing Date under the amended "next day" rule so long as such
position is "more likely than not" correct (or correct at a higher confidence
level).

(j) _Straddle Periods_. To the extent it is necessary for purposes of this
Agreement to determine the allocation of Taxes among a Straddle Period, Taxes
of the Company and its Subsidiaries based on or measured by income, gross or
net sales, or payments or receipts shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing
Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period based on an interim closing of the
books as of the close of business on the Closing Date and any other Taxes of
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing
Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period on a per diem basis.

(k) _280G_. The Company will (a), no later than three days prior to the
Closing Date, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each
"disqualified individual" with respect to the Company (within the meaning of
Section 280G(c) of the Code) who is entitled to receive any payments or
benefits that could constitute a "parachute payment" (within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code) (each such person, a " _280G Individual_ ")
a waiver of such 280G Individuals rights to some or all of such payments or
benefits (the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ") so that all remaining payments
and/or benefits, if any, shall not be deemed to be parachute payments; and (b)
prior to the Closing Date, with respect to each 280G Individual who agrees to
the waiver described in clause (a), submit to a stockholder vote (along with
adequate disclosure satisfying the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii)
of the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder) the right of any such
280G Individual to receive the Waived 280G Benefits. Prior to soliciting such
waivers and approval, the Company shall provide drafts

 



49  of such waivers and approval materials (including the written consent of
stockholders in lieu of special meeting of stockholders) to the Purchaser for
its review (including the ability to review source information) and approval
(which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Purchaser and its Affiliates agree to not provide or enter into any
arrangement, separately or in the aggregate with any existing arrangements,
with any disqualified individual on or prior to the Closing Date that would
provide for any "parachute payments."

 

9.02 _Voluntary Disclosure Process_.

 

(a) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date (the " _Notice Period_ "),
the Seller shall provide written notice to the Purchaser whether it desires
to cause the Company or any Subsidiary to seek to enter into a Voluntary
Disclosure Agreement with respect to any Identified State. If, prior to the
end of the Notice Period, the Seller provides written notice that it wants
the Company or any Subsidiary to seek to enter into a Voluntary Disclosure
Agreement with respect to any sales and/or use taxes (including any applicable
interest and penalties) that may be owed to any Identified State (each such
jurisdiction, a " _Designated State_ "), then the Company or applicable
Subsidiary, at the direction and control of the Seller, will promptly initiate
the process for entering into a Voluntary Disclosure Agreement with respect to
each Designated State; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall also be
entitled to participate in such process at its own expense. For each
Identified State that is not a Designated State, the Company or applicable
Subsidiary shall not initiate the process for entering into a Voluntary
Disclosure Agreement or otherwise enter into a Voluntary Disclosure Agreement.

(b) Promptly following the Closing Date (but in any event no later than 15
days after the Closing Date), the Seller on behalf of the Company or
applicable Subsidiary for each Designated State shall prepare a draft letter
addressed to the applicable Designated State indicating the intention of the
Company or applicable Subsidiary to enter into a Voluntary Disclosure
Agreement as promptly as practicable after Closing Date. After the submission
of such letter to the applicable Designated State, the Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly provide any necessary
information and documents to the applicable Designated State in order to
negotiate and finalize and enter into a Voluntary Disclosure Agreement with
such Designated State.

 

(c) All reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of preparing, filing and
negotiating the Voluntary Disclosure Agreement in each Designated State
(including any professional fees and expenses in connection therewith incurred
by the Company or any Subsidiary) shall be paid by the Seller solely out of
the Indemnity Escrow Account.

 

(d) Prior to the submission to a Designated State of the letter described in
_Section 9.02(b)_ or any other documents or materials to a Designated State
(including the required calculations and final payment with respect to the
Voluntary Disclosure Agreement in a Designated State), the Seller shall
provide the Purchaser with a copy of such letter, documents, materials
and calculations (and supporting work papers, documentation and copies of
applicable exemption certificates, if any) to be submitted to the Designated
State for the Purchasers review and approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Purchaser disagrees
with any of the items to be submitted to the Designated State and provides
written notice to Seller of such disagreement within five days, the parties
agree to send such 

 



50  disagreement to the Dispute Resolution Firm for an independent resolution of
such disagreement, which resolution shall be final and binding on all parties
hereto and the calculations and documents submitted to the Designated State
shall conform to such resolution. The costs and expenses of the Dispute
Resolution Firm with respect to the resolution of such disagreement shall be
borne by Purchaser unless the Dispute Resolution Firm agrees with Purchasers
proposed calculations and documents to be submitted with respect to the
Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (in which case the costs and expenses shall be
borne by the Seller).

 

(e) After the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall (and Purchaser
and its Affiliates shall cause the Company or any applicable Subsidiary to)
(A) cooperate with the Seller to the extent reasonably requested by the Seller
with respect to the voluntary disclosure process described in this _Section
9.02_ (including the requirements outlined in _Section 9.02(g)_ ) and (B) use
reasonable best efforts to timely obtain exemption certificates from customers
with respect to each of the Identified States.

(f) After the Closing, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall (and the
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to) register (including completing or preparing any applications
or accompanying documents) with respect to any Designated State to begin
filing, remitting or paying sales and/or use taxes until (A) the date
described in the Voluntary Disclosure Agreement on which such Designated State
permits the Company to begin filing, remitting or paying sales and/or use
taxes in such Designated State or (B) if earlier, the date on which such
Designated State permits the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to begin
filing, remitting or paying sales and/or use taxes as part of and
without jeopardizing or otherwise compromising the voluntary disclosure
process; _provided_ _that_ , notwithstanding the above, the parties agree that
the Company and its Subsidiaries are permitted to begin collecting sales
and/or use tax (but not registering, filing, remitting or paying such sales
and/or use tax to any Designated State) with respect to any Designated State
on the Closing Date. Within five days of the first instance of collection of
sales and/or use taxes in each Designated State, the Purchaser shall inform
the Seller of such collection so that Seller can represent such fact in any
letter requesting a Voluntary Disclosure Agreement that is submitted after the
Closing Date. Any sales and/or use tax collected with respect to any
Designated State prior to finalizing the Voluntary Disclosure Agreement being
entered into with the applicable Designated State shall be held in trust for
the Designated State and any such collected sales and/or use Taxes shall
be remitted to the Designated State (A) as required by the Designated State
in connection with the execution of the Voluntary Disclosure Agreement (to the
extent the period during which such sales and/or use taxes are collected are
incorporated into the payments required under the Voluntary Disclosure
Agreement) or (B) as otherwise required under applicable Law upon registering
and filing, remitting and paying sales and/or use taxes with the Designated
State; _provided that_ if the Designated State imposes any penalties or
interest attributable to the late filing of any sales and/or use tax return or
the late remittance of sales and/or use taxes for the period beginning on the
Closing Date but ending upon the finalization of the Voluntary Disclosure
Agreement with such Designated State (such amounts being " _Additional Sales
Tax Costs_ "), the Additional Sales Tax Costs shall be treated as "Indemnified
Taxes" under clause (y) of that definition. For the avoidance of doubt, the
restrictions contained in the first three sentences of this _Section 9.02(f)_
shall not apply to any state that is not a Designated State.

 



51 (g) Following the execution of the Voluntary Disclosure Agreement by a
Designated State, subject to the Purchaser review requirements of _Section
9.02(d)_ , the Seller shall promptly complete all obligations required
thereunder (excluding all obligations to make any payments thereunder other
than as described in the penultimate sentence of this _Section 9.02(g)_ ),
including preparing any spreadsheet or returns listing all sales during the
Voluntary Disclosure Agreement, computing the Tax due under the Voluntary
Disclosure Agreement, and preparing any exemption certificates or other
documentation for production to the Designated State, but excluding any
actions required to be taken by the Company or any Subsidiary to register to
begin filing, remitting or paying sales and/or use Taxes as provided in
_Section 9.02(f)_  or that require the involvement of Company or its
Subsidiaries to complete. The Seller shall provide copies to the Company of
any supporting documentation submitted to each Designated State in
satisfaction of such obligations under each Voluntary Disclosure Agreement.
Without duplication for any indemnity for Indemnified Taxes, the Seller and
Purchaser shall execute and deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent to release the amount of all Taxes due with respect to such Voluntary
Disclosure Agreement to the Company from the Indemnity Escrow Account. The
Company shall pay such Taxes to the Designated State, and it shall provide to
the Seller proof of payment of the Taxes.

 

9.03 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
Party hereto and at such Partys expense, any other Party shall execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as such requesting Party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable
to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

9.04 _Disclosure Generally_. All Disclosure Schedules attached hereto are
incorporated herein and expressly made a part of this Agreement as though
completely set forth herein. All references to this Agreement herein or in any
of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to refer to this
entire Agreement, including all Disclosure Schedules. For the avoidance of
doubt, any disclosure set forth in the Disclosure Schedules shall not alter
Sellers indemnification obligations for Indemnified Taxes, and the Seller
shall indemnify the Purchaser for all Indemnified Taxes as otherwise provided
in this Agreement.

Agreement by any party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching
party may have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties agree that
such non-breaching party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights
and remedies existing in their favor at law or in equity, to enforce their
rights and the other partys obligations hereunder not only by an action or
actions for damages but also by an action or actions for specific
performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond
or other security).

 

11.13 _Delivery by Facsimile_. This Agreement and any signed agreement entered
into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any amendments hereto
or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine
or electronic mail, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party hereto or to any such contract, each other party hereto
or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No party hereto or to any such contract shall raise the use of
a facsimile machine or electronic mail to deliver a signature or the fact that
any signature or contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of
facsimile machine or in electronic or digital form as a defense to the
formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any such defense.

 

11.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
any one of which need not contain the signature of more than one party, but
all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

11.15 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the construction,
validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the exhibits
and schedules hereto (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement) shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements
executed and performed entirely within such State, without giving effect to
any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



65 11.16 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT JURISDICTION AND VENUE
IN ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE PERFORMANCE OF
THE OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED HEREUNDER SHALL PROPERLY AND EXCLUSIVELY LIE IN ANY
FEDERAL OR STATE COURT LOCATED IN DELAWARE. EACH PARTY ALSO AGREES NOT TO
BRING ANY SUIT, ACTION, OR PROCEEDING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, OR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OBLIGATIONS
IMPOSED HEREUNDER IN ANY OTHER COURT. BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS
AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS
FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH SUIT,
ACTION, OR PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT VENUE WOULD BE
PROPER IN SUCH COURT, AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT ANY SUCH COURT IS AN
IMPROPER OR INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH SUIT, ACTION, OR
PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THE MAILING BY CERTIFIED OR
REGISTERED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, OF ANY PROCESS REQUIRED BY ANY SUCH
COURT SHALL CONSTITUTE VALID AND LAWFUL SERVICE OF PROCESS AGAINST THEM,
WITHOUT NECESSITY FOR SERVICE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PROVIDED BY STATUTE OR RULE
OF COURT.

11.17 _Prevailing Party_. If there shall occur any dispute or proceeding
between the parties relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, the non-prevailing party shall pay all reasonable costs
and fees (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) of the prevailing
party.

 

11.18 _Acknowledgement_. In any dispute or proceeding arising under or in
connection with this Agreement following the Closing, the Seller shall have
the right, at its election, to retain Kirkland and Ellis LLP to represent it in
such matter, and the Purchaser hereby irrevocably waives and consents to any
such representation in any such matter and the communication by such counsel
to the Seller in connection with any such representation of any fact known to
such counsel arising by reason of such counsels prior representation of the
Companies. The Purchaser irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that
all communications between any of the Companies, on the one hand, and
counsel, on the other hand, made in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution, delivery and Closing under, or any dispute or
proceeding arising under or in connection with this Agreement or otherwise
that, immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to be privileged
communications of any of the Companies, on the one hand, and its counsel, on
the other hand, and would not be subject to disclosure to the Purchaser in
connection with any process relating to a dispute arising under or in
connection with, this Agreement or otherwise, shall continue after the Closing
and for all purposes be deemed to be privileged communications between the
Seller, on the one hand, and their counsel, on the other hand, and neither
the Purchaser nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through
Purchaser shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the
privilege attaching to such communications, belongs to the Companies, and not
to the Seller.

the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent that an amount is paid or is
payable to the Seller

 



66  pursuant to this Agreement for the benefit of any service provider of either
Company or its Subsidiaries and such amount may be subject to payroll and
employment tax withholding under applicable Law (e.g., such amounts are
payable by the Seller to an employee of the Company and those amount are
treated as "wages" under Code §§3121, 3306, or 3402), then, at the written
request and direction of the Seller, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
applicable Company to, pay such amounts through the applicable payroll system
of the Purchaser or the applicable Company and make all applicable employment
and payroll tax withholding on such amounts in accordance with applicable
Law, _provided that_ , if such amount has already been paid to the Seller,
then the Seller agrees to promptly deliver to an account or accounts of one or
more of the Purchaser or the Company such amount as instructed by the
Purchaser. 

11.20 _Payments under this Agreement_. Each Party agrees that all amounts
required to be paid hereunder shall be paid in United States currency and,
except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, without discount,
rebate, reduction or withholding and not subject counterclaim or offset, on
the dates required hereby (with time being of the essence).
