Notice and Cure Provisions

   
---|--- 
 

 

 

  

  

7.1.1 Each Party will give prompt notice to the other of the occurrence, or
failure to occur, at any time from the date hereof until the earlier to occur
of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time of any event or
state of facts which occurrence or failure would, or would be likely to:

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

cause any of the representations or warranties of such Party contained herein
to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect on the date hereof or at
the Effective Time (provided that this paragraph (a) shall not apply in the
case of any

event or state of facts resulting from actions or omissions of Target which
are permitted or required by this Agreement); or

   
---|--- 
 

  

 

  

    

(b)

  |  

result in the failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by such Party hereunder prior to
the Effective Time.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

7.1.2 Purchaser may not exercise its rights to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.2.1(c)(iii) and Target may not exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2.1(d)(iii) unless the Party
intending to rely thereon has delivered a written notice to the other Party
specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, representations and
warranties or other matters which the Party delivering such notice is
asserting as the basis for the non-fulfilment or the applicable condition or
termination right, as the case may be. If any such notice is delivered,
provided that a Party is proceeding diligently to cure such matter and such
matter is capable of being cured, no Party may terminate this Agreement until
the expiration of a period of ten (10) business days from such notice, and
then only if such matter has not been cured by such date. If such notice has
been delivered prior to the date of the Target Meeting, such meeting shall,
unless the Parties otherwise agree, be postponed or adjourned until the expiry
of such period (and such postponement shall not constitute a breach of any
provision of this Agreement) provided that such extension shall not extend
beyond the Outside Date. If such notice has been delivered prior to the making
of the application for the Final Order, such application and such filing shall
be postponed until the expiry of such period, (and such postponement shall not
constitute a breach of any provision of this Agreement) provided that such
period does not extend beyond the Outside Date. For greater certainty, in the
event that such matter is cured within the time period referred to herein
without a Material Adverse Effect, this Agreement may not be terminated as a
result of the cured breach.

Non-Solicitation

   
---|--- 
 

 

 

 

  

  

7.2.1 Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 7.2, Target shall
not, directly or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee,
representative (including any financial or other advisor) or agent of Target
or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Representatives"): (a) solicit,
assist, initiate, facilitate or encourage (including entering into any form of
agreement, arrangement or understanding) the initiation of any inquiries or
proposals regarding, or furnish any information to any person in connection
with, an Acquisition Proposal; (b) participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any person (other than Purchaser or any of its affiliates)
regarding an Acquisition Proposal, provided, however, Target may advise any
person making an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal that such Acquisition
Proposal does not constitute and/or would not reasonably be expected to
constitute and/or could not reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior
Proposal when the Target Board has so determined; (c) approve, accept, endorse
or recommend, remain neutral with respect to or propose publicly to accept,
approve, endorse or recommend, or remain neutral with respect to, any
Acquisition Proposal; (d) accept or enter into or publicly propose to accept
or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, agreement,
understanding, undertaking or arrangement or other contract in respect of an
Acquisition Proposal; or (v) make a Change in Recommendation.

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

59

  

 

  

7.2.2 Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.2, Target shall, and
shall cause its subsidiaries and Representatives to immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement, discussion or
negotiation with any person conducted heretofore by Target, its subsidiaries
or any Representatives with respect to any potential Acquisition Proposal,
and, in connection therewith, Target will discontinue access to any of its
confidential information (and not establish or allow access to any of its
confidential information, or any data room, virtual or otherwise) and shall as
soon as reasonably practicable, request, to the extent that it is entitled to
do so (and exercise all rights it has to require) the return or destruction of
all confidential information regarding Target and its subsidiaries previously
provided to any such person or any other person and will request (and exercise
all rights it has to require) the destruction of all material including or
incorporating or otherwise reflecting any material confidential information
regarding Target and its subsidiaries. Target agrees that, except as permitted
Section 7.2.3 neither it nor any of its subsidiaries, shall terminate, waive,
amend or modify any provision of any existing confidentiality agreement
relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal or any standstill agreement to
which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party (it being acknowledged and
agreed that the automatic termination of any standstill provisions of any such
agreement as the result of the entering into an announcement of this Agreement
by Target, pursuant to the express terms of any such agreement, shall not be a
violation of this Section 7.2.2) and Target undertakes to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to enforce all standstill, non-disclosure, non-disturbance,
non-solicitation and similar covenants that it or any of its subsidiaries have
entered into prior to the date hereof.

  

  

7.2.3 Notwithstanding Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 and any other provision of this
Agreement or of any other agreement between Purchaser and Target, if at any
time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Target
Shareholder Approval of the Arrangement Resolution at the Target Meeting,
Target receives a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal that did not result
from a breach of Section 7.2 or an Acquisition Proposal is made to the Target
Shareholders and the Target Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or, if consummated in accordance with its terms
(disregarding, for the purposes of any such determination, any term of such
Acquisition Proposal that provides for a due diligence investigation), could
reasonably be expected to be a Superior Proposal, then Target may, in response
to a request made by the party making such Acquisition Proposal and provided
it is in material compliance with Sections 7.2.2 and 7.2.4:

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

furnish information with respect to Target and its subsidiaries to the person
making such Acquisition Proposal; and/or

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

enter into, participate, facilitate and maintain discussions or negotiations
with, and otherwise cooperate with or assist, the person making such
Acquisition Proposal;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

provided that Target shall not, and shall not allow its Representatives to,
disclose any non-public information with respect to Target to such person (i)
if such non public information has not been previously provided to, or is not
concurrently provided to, Purchaser; and (ii) without entering into a
confidentiality agreement with such person in a form customary for such
transactions which shall, without limitation, include a standstill provision
at least as stringent as contained in

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

60

  

  

the Confidentiality Agreement and which, without limitation, provides that any
Acquisition Proposal shall be made only to the Target Board and shall not be
publicly disclosed.

  

  

7.2.4 Target shall promptly notify Purchaser, at first orally and then in
writing within 24 hours of receipt of the Acquisition Proposal, in the event
it receives an Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms and
conditions thereof, and the identity of the person or persons making the
Acquisition Proposal, and shall include copies of the Acquisition Proposal and
any agreements which relate to the Acquisition Proposal to which Target has
access (for example, voting agreements with shareholders of Target or
agreements to provide financial support or other assistance to the person
making such Acquisition Proposal), or any amendment to any of the foregoing.
Target shall thereafter also provide such other details of the Acquisition
Proposal, or any amendment to any of the foregoing, as Purchaser may
reasonably request. Target shall keep Purchaser fully informed as to the
status, including any material changes to the terms, of such proposal,
inquiry, offer or request, or any amendment to any of the foregoing, and shall
respond promptly to all reasonable inquiries from Purchaser with respect
thereto.

  

  

7.2.5 Notwithstanding Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 and any other provision of this
Agreement, but subject to Section 7.3, at any time following the date of this
Agreement and prior to obtaining Target Shareholder Approval, if Target
receives an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this
Section 7.2 and which the Target Board concludes in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel) constitutes a
Superior Proposal, the Target Board may, subject to compliance with the
procedures set forth in Section 8.2, terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal.

  

  

7.2.6 Notwithstanding Sections 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 and any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Target Board
from taking any action or making a Change in Recommendation or from making any
disclosure to any Target Securityholders prior to the Effective Time
including, for greater certainty, disclosure of a Change in Recommendation in
respect of an Acquisition Proposal, if, in the good faith judgment of the
Target Board, and based upon the advice of outside legal counsel, failure to
take such action or make such disclosure would be inconsistent with the Target
Board's exercise of its fiduciary duties or such action or disclosure is
otherwise required under applicable Law (including by responding to an
Acquisition Proposal under a directors' circular or otherwise as required
under Securities Laws); provided that, for greater certainty, in the event of
a Change of Recommendation and a termination by Purchaser of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.2.1(c)(i), Target shall pay the Termination Fee to the
extent it is required by Section 7.4. In addition, subject to the provisions
of this Section 7.2 and Section 7.3, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent Target or the Target Board from calling and holding a meeting of
Target Shareholders, or any of them, requisitioned by Target Shareholders, or
any of them, in accordance with the CBCA or ordered to be held by a court or
Regulatory Authority of competent jurisdiction in accordance with applicable
Laws.

Right to Match

   
---|--- 
 

 

 

 

 

  

  

7.3.1 Target covenants that it will not accept, approve, endorse, recommend or
enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement in respect of a
Superior Proposal (other than a confidentiality and standstill agreement
permitted by Section 7.2.3) unless:

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

61

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

Target has complied with its obligations under Section 7.2 and has provided
Purchaser with a copy of the Superior Proposal and all related documentation
described in Section 7.2.4; and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

a period (the "Response Period") commencing on the later of (x) the date on
which Purchaser receives written notice from the Target Board that the Target
Board has determined, subject only to compliance with this Section 7.3, to
accept, approve, endorse, recommend or enter into a binding agreement to
proceed with such Superior Proposal, and (y) the date Purchaser receives a
copy of the Superior Proposal and all related documentation described in
Section 7.2.4, and ending at 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the fifth (5th)
business day following such date, shall have expired.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

7.3.2 During the Response Period, Purchaser will have the right, but not the
obligation, to offer to amend this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement,
including an increase in, or modification of, the consideration to be paid to
the Securityholders of Target pursuant to the Arrangement. The Target Board
shall review any such offer by Purchaser to amend this Agreement and the Plan
of Arrangement to determine whether the Acquisition Proposal to which
Purchaser is responding would continue to be a Superior Proposal when assessed
against the Arrangement as it is proposed in writing by Purchaser to be
amended. If the Target Board determines that the Acquisition Proposal no
longer constitutes a Superior Proposal, when assessed against this Agreement
and the Plan of Arrangement as they are proposed to be amended, the Target
Board will cause Target to enter into an amendment to this Agreement with
Purchaser incorporating the amendments to the Agreement and Plan of
Arrangement as set out in the written offer to amend, and will promptly
reaffirm its recommendation of the Arrangement by the prompt issuance of a
press release to that effect. If the Target Board determines that the
Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal, Target may approve
and recommend that holders of Target Shares accept such Superior Proposal and
may terminate this Agreement and shall pay the Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 8.2.1(d)(i) in order to accept or enter into an agreement,
understanding or arrangement to proceed with the Superior Proposal.

  

  

7.3.3 Where at any time before the Target Meeting, Target has provided
Purchaser with a notice under Section 7.3.1, an Acquisition Proposal has been
publicly disclosed or announced and the Response Period has not elapsed, then,
subject to applicable laws, at Purchaser's request, Target will postpone or
adjourn the Target Meeting to a date acceptable to Purchaser, acting
reasonably, but not more than seven (7) business days after the scheduled date
of the Target Meeting.

  

  

7.3.4 Each successive amendment to any Acquisition Proposal that results in an
increase in, or modification of, the consideration (or value of such
consideration) to be received by the holders of the Target Shares shall
constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of this Section 7.3 and
Purchaser shall be afforded a new Response Period and the rights afforded in
Section 7.3.2 in respect of each such Acquisition Proposal.

7.4.1 Except as otherwise provided herein, all fees, costs and expenses
(including any broker's fees or finder's fees) incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement shall be paid by the Party
incurring such fees, costs or expenses.

  

  

7.4.2 If a Termination Fee Event occurs, Target shall pay Purchaser (by wire
transfer of immediately available funds) the Termination Fee in accordance
with Section 7.4.5.

  

  

7.4.3 For the purposes of this Agreement, "Termination Fee" means $15 million.

  

  

7.4.4 For the purposes of this Agreement, "Termination Fee Event" means the
termination of this Agreement:

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

by Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.2.1(c)(i) or Section 8.2.1(c)(vi);

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

by Target pursuant to Section 8.2.1(d)(i); or

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

by Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.2.1(b)(i), or Section 8.2.1(c)(v) or by
either Party pursuant to 8.2.1(b)(iii), but only if, in the case of this
paragraph (c), prior to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or
the holding of the Target Meeting, a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, or the
intention to make an Acquisition Proposal, with respect to Target shall have
been made to Target or publicly announced by any person (other than Purchaser
or any of its affiliates) and such Acquisition Proposal or intention shall not
have been publicly withdrawn at least ten (10) business days prior to the
Target Meeting and within six (6) months following the date of such
termination:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

such Acquisition Proposal is consummated by Target; or

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

Target and/or one or more of its subsidiaries enters into a definitive
agreement in respect of, or the Target Board approves or recommends, such
Acquisition Proposal which is subsequently consummated at any time thereafter;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

provided that, for the purposes of this Section 7.4.4(c), all references to
"20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be
references to "50%".

  

  

7.4.5 If a Termination Fee Event occurs due to a termination of this Agreement
by Target pursuant to Section 8.2.1(d)(i), or by Purchaser pursuant to Section
8.2.1(c)(i) or Section 8.2.1(c)(vi), the Termination Fee shall be payable
simultaneously with the occurrence of such Termination Fee Event. If a
Termination Fee Event occurs in the circumstances set out in Section 7.4.4(c),
the Termination Fee shall be payable within two business days following the
closing of the applicable transaction referred to therein.

  

  

7.4.6 Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.4 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement and that,

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

63

  

  

 

without those agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Each Party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts set out in this
Section 7.4 are payments of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-
estimate of the damages which the Party entitled to such damages will suffer
or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such payment and the
resultant termination of this Agreement and are not penalties. Target
irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defense that any such
liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For greater certainty, each
Party agrees that, upon any termination of this Agreement under circumstances
where Purchaser is entitled to the Termination Fee and such Termination Fee is
paid in full, Purchaser shall be precluded from any other remedy against
Target at law or in equity or otherwise (including, without limitation, an
order for specific performance), and shall not seek to obtain any recovery,
judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or
punitive damages, against Target or any of its subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members,
shareholders or affiliates in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

 

  

7.4.7 Nothing in this Section 7.4 shall relieve or have the effect of
relieving any Party in any way from liability for damages incurred or suffered
by a Party as a result of an intentional or wilful breach of this Agreement.

  

  

7.4.8 Nothing in this Section 7.4 shall preclude a Party from seeking
injunctive relief to restrain any breach or threatened breach of the covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement or
otherwise to obtain specific performance of any such covenants or agreements,
without the necessity of posting bond or security in connection therewith.

  

  

7.4.9 In no event shall Target be obligated to pay to Purchaser an amount in
respect of the termination of this Agreement that is, in aggregate, in excess
of the Termination Fee.

Access to Information; Confidentiality

   
---|--- 
 

 

 

 

 

  

  

From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement, subject to compliance with applicable Law and
the terms of any existing Contracts, Target shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees to afford to
Purchaser and to the officers and employees of Purchaser such access as
Purchaser may reasonably require at all reasonable times, including for the
purpose of facilitating integration business planning, to their officers,
employees, agents, properties, books, records and Material Contracts, and
shall furnish Purchaser with all data and information as Purchaser may
reasonably request. Purchaser and Target acknowledge and agree that
information furnished pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Insurance and Indemnification

   
---|--- 
 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

7.6.1 Purchaser will, or will cause Target and its subsidiaries to, maintain
in effect without any reduction in scope or coverage for six (6) years from
the Effective Date customary policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance providing protection no less favourable to the protection provided
by the policies maintained by Target and its subsidiaries which are in

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

64

  

  

effect immediately prior to the Effective Date and providing protection in
respect of claims arising from facts or events which occurred on or prior to
the Effective Date; provided, however, that Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that prior to the Effective Date, Target may, in the alternative, purchase run
off directors' and officers' liability insurance for a period of up to six
years from the Effective Date with the prior written consent of Purchaser.

  

  

7.6.2 Purchaser agrees that it shall honour all rights to indemnification or
exculpation now existing in favour of present and former officers and
directors of Target and its subsidiaries to the extent that such rights are
fully disclosed in Section 7.6.2 of the Target Disclosure Letter, and
acknowledges that such rights, to the extent that they are disclosed in
Section 7.6.2 of the Target Disclosure Letter, shall survive the completion of
the Plan of Arrangement and shall continue in full force and effect.

  

  

7.6.3 The provisions of this Section 7.6 are intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each insured or indemnified person, his or her heirs
and his or her legal representatives and, for such purpose, Target hereby
confirms that it is acting as agent and trustee on their behalf.

  

  

7.6.4 Purchaser will, and will cause Target and its subsidiaries to, provide
on the Effective Date, a release to each of the directors and officers of the
Target and its subsidiaries not continuing with Target or its subsidiaries, in
a form satisfactory to Target acting reasonably, provided however that such
release shall not release any liability for fraud and provided further that
each director and officer shall release Target and its subsidiaries from any
liability to him or her as a director or officer, other than liabilities
relating to payments to which the director or officer is entitled in
connection with the agreements set forth in the Target Disclosure Letter. In
addition, the Purchaser will provide a release and indemnification on the
Effective Date to certain representatives of Extorre or its subsidiaries as
mutually agreed upon between the Parties, acting reasonably.

This Agreement shall be governed in all respects, including validity,
interpretation and effect, by the laws of the Province of British Columbia and
the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without giving effect to the
principles of conflict of laws thereof. The Parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally consent to and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Court of the Province of Ontario for any actions, suits or proceedings arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the matters contemplated hereby (and
agree not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except
in such courts) and further agree that service of any process, summons, notice
or document by registered mail to the addresses of the Parties set forth in
this Agreement shall be effective service of process for any action, suit or
proceeding brought against any Party to such Court. The Parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of
any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the matters
contemplated hereby in the Courts of the Province of Ontario and hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim
in any such Court that any such action, suit or proceeding so brought has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

Injunctive Relief

Subject to Section 7.4, the Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur
for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy at law in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement, any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any
such injunctive or other equitable relief hereby being waived. Such remedy
will not be the exclusive remedy for a breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement, but will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or
equity to each of the Parties.

Purchaser may assign all or any part of its rights under this Agreement to,
and its obligations under this Agreement may be assumed by, a direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser, provided that if such
assignment and/or assumption takes place, Purchaser shall continue to be
liable jointly and severally with such subsidiary for all of its obligations
hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding on and shall enure to the benefit
of the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  

  

This Agreement (including the exhibits and schedules hereto and the Target
Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the Parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and, except as expressly provided herein,
this Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer upon any person other
than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder. Except as expressly
permitted by the terms hereof, neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned by either of the Parties
without the prior written consent of the other Party.

the Arrangement Agreement, except in respect of the sequence of the steps

Purchaser, the Dissenting Shareholders and the Target Optionholders.

  

  

ARTICLE 3

  

ARRANGEMENT

  

  

3.1 Commencing at the Effective Time, each of the events set out below shall
occur and shall be deemed to occur sequentially in the following order without
any further act or formality except as otherwise expressly provided herein:

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

77

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

the Target Rights Plan shall be terminated (and all rights issued thereunder
shall expire) and shall cease to be of any force or effect;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

all outstanding Target Shares held by subsidiaries of the Purchaser shall be
cancelled without any repayment of capital;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(c)

  |  

each Target Share (other than Target Shares held by a Dissenting Shareholder
or by Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries) shall be and shall be deemed to be
transferred by the holder thereof to Purchaser (free and clear of any liens,
charges or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever), and the registered holder
of such Target Share immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled
to receive, subject to the following provisions of this Section 3.1(a) and
subject to Section 4.6, consideration comprised of:

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(i)

  |  

$3.50, and

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(ii)

  |  

0.0467 of a Purchaser Share,

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

in exchange for each Target Share;

  

  

    

(d)

  |  

the Target Shares held by Dissenting Shareholders who have exercised Dissent
Rights which remain valid immediately before the Effective Time shall, as of
the Effective Time, be deemed to have been transferred to Purchaser (free and
clear of any liens, charges or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever) and
Purchaser shall thereupon be obligated to pay the amount therefor determined
and payable in accordance with Article 5 hereof and, as of the Effective Time,
such Dissenting Shareholders shall cease to have any rights as Target
Shareholders, other than the right to be paid the fair value of their Target
Shares in accordance with the Dissent Rights;

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(e)

  |  

pursuant to the terms of the Target Share Incentive Plan, including section
3.9 thereof, each holder of a Target Option outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, after the Effective Time, be entitled to receive
(and shall accept), upon the exercise of such holder's Target Options (which
after the Effective Time shall be referred to as "Converted Purchaser
Options"), for the same aggregate consideration therefor and in lieu of any
Target Shares or other consideration, a number of Purchaser Shares equal to
the number of Target Shares otherwise issuable multiplied by 0.2648, subject
to further adjustment after the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of
the Converted Purchaser Options. Each such Converted Purchaser Option shall
continue to be governed by and be subject to the terms of the Target Stock
Option Plan. If the adjustment to the Target Options contemplated by this
paragraph results in a disposition of Target Options for Converted Purchaser
Options or "new" Target Options, it is intended that the provisions of
subsection 7(1.4) of the Tax Act apply to any such disposition. Therefore, in
the event that the Converted Purchaser Option In-The-Money Amount in respect
of such Converted Purchaser Option exceeds the Target Option In-The-Money
Amount in respect of the Target Option, the

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

78

  

 

  

    

  |  

number of Purchaser Shares which may be acquired on exercise of the Converted
Purchaser Option immediately after the Effective Time will be adjusted
accordingly with effect at and from the Effective Time to ensure that the
Converted Purchaser Option In-The-Money Amount in respect of the Converted
Purchaser Option does not exceed the Target Option In-The-Money Amount in
respect of the Target Option and the ratio of the amount payable to acquire
such shares to the value of such shares to be acquired shall be unchanged.
Following the Effective Time, Target and Purchaser shall make the appropriate
entries in their respective securities registers to reflect the matters
referred to in Section 3.1.

   
---|--- 
 

  

 

  

3.2 An Eligible Holder whose Target Shares are transferred to Purchaser in
part for Purchaser Shares pursuant to the Arrangement shall be entitled to
make an income tax election, pursuant to section 85 of the Tax Act (and any
analogous provision of provincial income tax law) (a "Section 85 Election")
with respect to the transfer by providing the necessary information to such
person as Purchaser may designate on or before 90 days after the Effective
Date in accordance with the procedures set out in the tax instruction letter
provided by Purchaser. Neither Target, Purchaser nor any successor corporation
shall be responsible for the proper completion of any election form nor,
except for the obligation to sign and return duly completed election forms in
respect of Eligible Holders who provide the necessary information within 90
days following the Effective Date, for any taxes, interest or penalties
resulting from the failure of an Eligible Holder to properly complete or file
such election forms in the form and manner and within the time prescribed by
the Tax Act (or any applicable provincial legislation). Purchaser will make a
Section 85 Election with every Eligible Holder who provides the necessary
information in accordance with this Section 3.2 and within 30 days will sign
and return such election forms to the Eligible Holder. In its sole discretion,
Purchaser or any successor corporation may choose to sign and return an
election form in respect of Eligible Holders who provide the necessary
information more than 90 days following the Effective Date, but will have no
obligation to do so. A tax election package, consisting of the relevant
federal tax election forms and a tax instruction letter, shall be made
available to Eligible Holders within 30 days of the Effective Date via the
internet on Purchaser's website at www.yamana.com. Alternatively, a tax
instruction letter shall also be made available from the Depositary by
checking the appropriate box on the Letter of Transmittal and submitting the
Letter of Transmittal to the Depositary within 30 days following the Effective
Date in accordance with the procedures set out in the Notice of Special
Meeting of Shareholders and Management Information Circular of Target relating
to the Arrangement. The tax instruction letter shall provide general
instructions on how to make the Section 85 Election with Purchaser in order to
obtain a full or partial tax-deferred rollover for Canadian income tax
purposes in respect of the transfer of the Eligible Holder's Target Shares to
Purchaser.

  

  

  

ARTICLE 4

  

OUTSTANDING CERTIFICATES AND FRACTIONAL SECURITIES

  

  

4.1 From and after the Effective Time, any certificates representing Target
Shares held by Former Target Shareholders shall represent only the right to
receive the Consideration to which the holders are entitled under the
Arrangement, or as to those held by Dissenting Shareholders, to receive the
fair value of the Target Shares represented by such certificates.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

79

  

  

4.2 Purchaser, as soon as practicable following the later of the Effective
Date and the date of deposit by a Former Target Shareholder of a duly
completed Letter of Transmittal and the certificates representing the Target
Shares held by such Former Target Shareholder, will either:

  

  

    

(a)

  |  

forward or cause to be forwarded by first class mail (postage prepaid) to such
Former Target Shareholder at the address specified in the Letter of
Transmittal, or

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

    

(b)

  |  

if requested by such Former Target Shareholder in the Letter of Transmittal,
make available or cause to be made available at the Depositary for pickup by
such Former Target Shareholder certificates representing the number of
Purchaser Shares issued to such holder and a cheque representing the cash
consideration payable to such holder under the Arrangement.

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

4.3 If any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented an interest in outstanding Target Shares that were transferred or
cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1 has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary shall issue and deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the Consideration to
which the holder is entitled pursuant to the Arrangement (and any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto). Unless otherwise agreed to by Purchaser,
the person who is entitled to receive such Consideration shall, as a condition
precedent to the receipt thereof, give a bond to Purchaser and the Depositary,
which bond is in form and substance satisfactory to Purchaser and the
Depositary, or shall otherwise indemnify Purchaser and its transfer agent
against any claim that may be made against any of them with respect to the
certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

  

4.4 All dividends and distributions made after the Effective Time with respect
to any Purchaser Shares allotted and issued pursuant to this Arrangement but
for which a certificate has not been issued shall be paid or delivered to the
Depositary to be held by the Depositary in trust for the registered holder of
such Purchaser Shares. All monies received by the Depositary shall be invested
by it in interest-bearing trust accounts upon such terms as the Depositary may
reasonably deem appropriate. Subject to this Section 4.4\\\, the Depositary
shall pay and deliver to any such registered holder, as soon as reasonably
practicable after application therefor is made by the registered holder to the
Depositary in such form as the Depositary may reasonably require, such
distributions and any interest thereon to which such holder is entitled, net
of any applicable withholding and other taxes.

  

  

4.5 Any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Target Shares that is not deposited with all other documents as required by
this Plan of Arrangement on or before the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Date shall cease to represent a right or claim of any kind or nature and, for
greater certainty, the right of the Former Target Shareholder of such Target
Shares to receive the Consideration shall be deemed to be surrendered to
Purchaser together with all dividends, distributions or cash payments thereon
held for such holder. For greater certainty, on such date, any certificate
formerly representing Target Shares shall cease to represent a claim or
interest of any kind or nature against Target or Purchaser.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

80

  

  

4.6 In no event shall any holder of Target Shares be entitled to a fractional
Purchaser Share. Where the aggregate number of Purchaser Shares to be issued
to a Target Shareholder as Consideration under the Arrangement would result in
a fraction of a Purchaser Share being issuable, the number of Purchaser Shares
to be received by such Target Shareholder shall be shall be rounded up to the
nearest whole Purchaser Share in the event that a Target Shareholder is
entitled to a fractional share representing 0.5 or more of a Purchaser Share
and shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Purchaser Share in the event
that a Target Shareholder is entitled to a fractional share representing less
than 0.5 of a Purchaser Share. Any cash consideration owing to a Target
Shareholder shall be rounded up to the next whole cent.

  

  

4.7 Purchaser, Target and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to any person
pursuant to the Arrangement and from all dividends or other distributions
otherwise payable to any former Target Securityholders such amounts as
Purchaser, Target or the Depositary may be required to deduct and withhold
therefrom under any provision of applicable laws in respect of taxes,
including without limitation, any amounts payable in respect of Target
Options. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted, withheld and
remitted, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Plan of
Arrangement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

  

  

ARTICLE 5

  

DISSENTING SHAREHOLDERS

  

  

5.1 Pursuant to the Interim Order, each registered holder of Target Shares
shall have the right to dissent with respect to the Arrangement under the
provisions of the CBCA, the Interim Order and the Final Order. A Dissenting
Shareholder shall, at the Effective Time, cease to have any rights as a holder
of Target Shares and shall only be entitled to be paid the fair value of the
holder's Target Shares. A Dissenting Shareholder who is paid the fair value of
the holder's Target Shares shall be deemed to have transferred the holder's
Target Shares to Purchaser at the Effective Time, notwithstanding the
provisions of the CBCA. A Dissenting Shareholder who, for any reason is not
entitled to be paid the fair value of the holder's Target Shares, shall be
treated as if the holder had participated in the Arrangement on the same basis
as a non-dissenting holder of Target Shares, notwithstanding the provisions of
the CBCA. The fair value of the Target Shares shall be determined as of the
close of business on the last business day before the day on which the
Arrangement is approved by the Target Shareholders at the Target Meeting; but
in no event shall Target be required to recognize such Dissenting Shareholder
as shareholders of Target after the Effective Time and the names of such
holders shall be removed from the applicable Target register of shareholders
as at the Effective Time. For greater certainty, in addition to any other
restrictions in the CBCA, no person who has voted in favour of the Arrangement
shall be entitled to dissent with respect to the Arrangement.

  

  

ARTICLE 6

6.1 Target and Purchaser may amend, modify and/or supplement this Plan of
Arrangement at any time and from time to time prior to the Effective Time,
provided that each such amendment, modification and/or supplement must be: (a)
set out in writing; (b) filed with

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

81

  

  

the Court and, if made following the Target Meeting, approved by the Court;
and (c) communicated to Target Shareholders if and as required by the Court.

  

  

6.2 Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement may
be proposed by Target and Purchaser at any time prior to or at the Target
Meeting with or without any other prior notice or communication, and if so
proposed and accepted by the persons voting at the Target Meeting (other than
as may be required under the Interim Order), shall become part of this Plan of
Arrangement for all purposes.

  

  

6.3 Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Plan of Arrangement that
is approved by the Court following the Target Meeting shall be effective only
if (a) it is consented to by each of Target and Purchaser; and (b) if required
by the Court or applicable law, it is consented to by Target Shareholders.

  

  

6.4 Each of Purchaser and Target shall make, do and execute, or cause to be
made, done and executed, all such further acts, deeds, agreements, transfers,
elections, assurances, instruments or documents as may reasonably be required
by any of them in order to implement this Plan of Arrangement and to further
document or evidence any of the transactions or events set out in this Plan of
Arrangement.
