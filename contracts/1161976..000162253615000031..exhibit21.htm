contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and agreements in this
Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be
legally bound, hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE I DEFINITIONS AND RULES OF
CONSTRUCTION Section 1.1 Definitions. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement
have the meanings ascribed to them by definition in this Agreement or in
Appendix A hereto. ARTICLE II PURCHASE AND SALE Section 2.1 Purchase and Sale
of Transferred Assets. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, Seller agrees to sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver to Buyer,

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc008.jpg) 

7 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 Section 2.2 Excluded Assets.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, from and after the Closing,
Seller and its Affiliates shall retain all of their existing right, title and
interest in and to the Excluded Assets. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Transferred Assets shall not include the Excluded Assets. Section 2.3
Assumption of Liabilities. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, Buyer shall assume and discharge or perform when due all the
Assumed Liabilities. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement (including, without limiting or reducing in any respect, the rights
of any Indemnified Buyer Entity to indemnification pursuant to Section 5.11 or
Section 7.2) Buyer, for itself and each of its Affiliates, hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives and releases Seller and each of its Affiliates from
all Assumed Liabilities. Section 2.4 Retained Liabilities. On the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, Seller and its Affiliates shall
retain and be responsible for all Retained Liabilities. Subject to the other
terms and conditions of this Agreement, Seller, for itself and each of its
Affiliates, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives and releases Buyer
and each of its Affiliates from all Retained Liabilities. Section 2.5 Purchase
Price. (a) On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, in
consideration of the sale of the Transferred Assets, at the Closing, in
addition to the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, Buyer shall pay to
Seller an aggregate purchase price (the "Purchase Price") equal to
$859,570,000 (the "Base Purchase Price"), as adjusted by (i) the Estimated
Surge Tank Remaining Budget (in accordance with Section 2.6(a)) and (ii) the
Estimated Proration Adjustment Amount (in accordance with Section 2.8(b)), by
wire transfer of immediately available funds in U.S. Dollars to such account
or accounts as specified by Seller to Buyer in writing at least two (2)
Business Days prior to the Closing. (b) Within ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date, Seller shall provide to Buyer an allocation of the Base Purchase
Price, together with any other amounts properly included in the purchase price
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, among the Transferred Assets (the
"Purchase Price Allocation"). The Purchase Price Allocation shall be prepared
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code, as applicable, and the applicable
Treasury Regulations thereunder. If within thirty (30) days following delivery
of such allocation Buyer objects to such allocation to Seller in writing,
Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to attempt to resolve their
disagreement and agree on the Purchase Price Allocation. If the Parties agree
on a Purchase Price Allocation and thereafter any adjustment to the Base
Purchase Price occurs pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then within
thirty (30) days of such adjustment, Seller shall provide to Buyer a revised
Purchase Price Allocation, allocating any such adjustments among the
Transferred Assets, and if within thirty (30) days following delivery of such
allocation Buyer objects to such proposed revised allocation to Seller in
writing, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to attempt to resolve
their disagreement and agree on the Purchase Price Allocation. Should such
foregoing negotiations not result in an agreement within twenty (20) days
after receipt by Seller of such written objection from Buyer, then either (i)
Seller or (ii) Buyer may submit this matter to the Independent Accounting  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc009.jpg) 

8 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 Independent Accounting Firm will
deliver to Seller and Buyer a written determination of the final Purchase
Price Allocation (such determination to include a worksheet setting forth all
material calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be based
solely on information provided to the Independent Accounting Firm by Seller
and Buyer) within thirty (30) days of the submission of the dispute to the
Independent Accounting Firm, which determination will be final, binding and
conclusive on the Parties absent manifest error. All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting
Firm pursuant to this Section 2.5(b) will be split and paid for on a 50%/50%
basis between (A) Seller and (B) Buyer. None of Seller, Buyer or any Affiliate
of any of the foregoing shall take, or permit any Affiliate to take, any
position for any Tax purpose (whether in connection with audits, Tax Returns
or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the final Purchase Price Allocation,
except as required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax
law). The Parties will file Forms 8594 with the Internal Revenue Service
consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation. Section 2.6 Surge Tank
Remaining Budget Adjustment. (a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller will deliver to Buyer a worksheet setting forth Seller's
good faith reasonable estimate of the Surge Tank Remaining Budget as of the

equal to the Estimated Surge Tank Remaining Budget, if any. (b) Within thirty
(30) days after the Closing, Buyer will prepare and deliver to Seller a
computation (the "Remaining Budget Adjustment Statement") of the actual Surge
Tank Remaining Budget as of the Closing Date (the "Actual Surge Tank Remaining
Budget"), together with reasonable detail and supporting material regarding
the computation thereof. If within thirty (30) days following delivery of the
Remaining Budget Adjustment Statement, Seller does not object in writing
thereto to Buyer, then the Actual Surge Tank Remaining Budget shall be as
reflected on the Remaining Budget Adjustment Statement. (c) If within thirty
(30) days following delivery of the Remaining Budget Adjustment Statement
Seller objects to the Remaining Budget Adjustment Statement to Buyer in
writing, then Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith and attempt to
resolve their disagreement. Should such negotiations not result in an
agreement within twenty (20) days after receipt by Buyer of such written
objection from Seller, then the matter shall be submitted for resolution and
determination to the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting
Firm will deliver to Seller and Buyer a written determination of the disputed
Actual Surge Tank Remaining Budget (such determination to include a worksheet

and to be based solely on information provided to the Independent Accounting
Firm by Buyer and Seller) within thirty (30) days of the submission of the
dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm, which determination will be final,
binding and conclusive on the Parties. In resolving any disagreement, the
Independent Accounting Firm may not assign any value to a disputed item
greater than the greatest value claimed for such disputed item by any Party or
lesser than the lowest value claimed for such disputed item by any Party. All
fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed

9 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 by the Independent Accounting Firm
pursuant to this Section 2.6 will be allocated between Seller and Buyer in
inverse proportion as each shall prevail in respect of the dollar amount of
disputed items so submitted (as finally determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm). (d) If, following the determination of the Actual Surge Tank
Remaining Budget (as agreed between the Parties or as determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm), the Estimated Surge Tank Remaining Budget less
the Actual Surge Tank Remaining Budget is a positive number, then Buyer, shall
be obligated to pay Seller a cash payment equal to such positive number. If
the Estimated Surge Tank Remaining Budget less the Actual Surge Tank Remaining
Budget is a negative number, then Seller shall be obligated to pay Buyer a
cash payment equal to the absolute value of such negative number. Any such
payment will be due and payable within ten (10) Business Days after the Actual
Surge Tank Remaining Budget is finally determined as provided in this Section
2.6 and will be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
such account or accounts as shall be specified by Buyer or Seller, as
applicable, to the other Party in writing. Any such payment will be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law. (e) Following the Closing, Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate and provide each other and, if applicable, the
Independent Accounting Firm, with reasonable access to such books, records and
employees as are reasonably requested in connection with the preparation of
the Remaining Budget Adjustment Statement and the other matters addressed in
this Section 2.6. Section 2.7 Capital Expenditures Adjustment. (a) Within
thirty (30) days after the later of (i) the Closing and (ii) the completion of
the Surge Tank Rehabilitation, Buyer will prepare and deliver to Seller a
computation (the "Surge Tank Completion Adjustment Statement") of the actual
Capital Expenditures Adjustment (the "Actual Capital Expenditures
Adjustment"), together with reasonable detail and supporting material
regarding the computation thereof. If within thirty (30) days following
delivery of the Surge Tank Completion Adjustment Statement, Seller does not
object in writing thereto to Buyer, then the Actual Capital Expenditures
Adjustment shall be as reflected on the Surge Tank Completion Adjustment
Statement. (b) If within thirty (30) days following delivery of the Surge Tank
Completion Adjustment Statement Seller objects to the Surge Tank Completion
Adjustment Statement to Buyer in writing, then Buyer and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve their disagreement. Should such
negotiations not result in an agreement within twenty (20) days after receipt
by Buyer of such written objection from Seller, then the matter shall be
submitted for resolution and determination to the Independent Accounting Firm.
The Independent Accounting Firm will deliver to Buyer and Seller a written
determination of the disputed Actual Capital Expenditures Adjustment (such
determination to include a worksheet setting forth all material calculations
used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on information
provided to the Independent Accounting Firm by Buyer and Seller) within thirty
(30) days of the submission of the dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm,
which determination will be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties. In
resolving any disagreement, the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign any
value to a disputed item greater than the greatest value claimed for such
disputed item by any Party or lesser than the lowest value claimed for such  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc011.jpg) 

10 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 disputed item by any Party. All fees
and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent
Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.7 will be allocated between Seller
and Buyer in inverse proportion as each shall prevail in respect of the dollar
amount of disputed items so submitted (as finally determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm). (c) If, following the determination of the
Actual Capital Expenditures Adjustment (as agreed between the Parties or as
determined by the Independent Accounting Firm), the Actual Capital
Expenditures Adjustment is a positive number, then Seller, shall be obligated
to pay Buyer a cash payment equal to such positive number. If, following the
determination of the Actual Capital Expenditures Adjustment (as agreed between
the Parties or as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm), the Actual
Capital Expenditures Adjustment is a negative number, then Buyer shall be
obligated to pay Seller a cash payment equal to the absolute value of such
negative number. Any such payment will be due and payable within ten (10)
Business Days after the Actual Capital Expenditures Adjustment is finally
determined as provided in this Section 2.7 and will be payable by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as shall
be specified by Buyer or Seller, as applicable, to the other Party in writing.
Any such payment will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for
all Tax purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law. (d)
Following the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and provide each other
and, if applicable, the Independent Accounting Firm, with reasonable access to
such books, records and employees as are reasonably requested in connection
with the preparation of the Surge Tank Completion Adjustment Statement and the
other matters addressed in this Section 2.7. Section 2.8 Adjustments and
Prorations. (a) The operation of the Business until 11:59 p.m. (Eastern
Prevailing Time) on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the
"Effective Time") shall be for the account of Seller and thereafter for the
account of Buyer. The Parties agree that all of the items listed on Schedule
2.8 (the "Prorated Items") relating to the Transferred Assets shall be
prorated as of the Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.8. Schedule 2.8
also contains an example of the calculation of the proration of the real
property taxes and other Taxes attributable to the Transferred Assets. (b) At
least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller will deliver
to Buyer a worksheet setting forth (i) Seller's good faith reasonable estimate
of the Prorated Amount for each Prorated Item (with respect to each Prorated
Item, the "Estimated Prorated Amount"), as well as, in each case, reasonable
detail and supporting material regarding the computation thereof, and (ii) the
aggregate sum of the Estimated Prorated Amounts (the "Estimated Proration
Adjustment Amount"). In the event that, with respect to any Prorated Item,
actual figures are not available as of the time of the calculation of the
Estimated Prorated Amount, the Estimated Prorated Amount for such Prorated
Item shall be a good faith reasonable estimate, including (as applicable)
based upon the actual fee, cost or amount of the Prorated Item for the most
recent preceding year (or appropriate period) for which an actual fee, cost or
amount paid is available. If the Estimated Proration Adjustment Amount is a
positive number, the Base Purchase Price payable at Closing will be increased
by an amount equal to such Estimated  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc012.jpg) 

11 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 Proration Adjustment Amount. If the
Estimated Proration Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Base Purchase
Price payable at Closing will be decreased by an amount equal to the absolute
value of such Estimated Proration Adjustment Amount. (c) As soon as Buyer
obtains Knowledge of the actual Prorated Amount with respect to any Prorated
Item (including through notification by Seller), Buyer shall promptly notify
Seller of such Prorated Item and actual Prorated Amount, together with
reasonable detail and supporting material regarding the computation thereof.
For any Prorated Item with respect to which the Estimated Prorated Amount is
not equal to the actual Prorated Amount, within thirty (30) days of the date
when Buyer has delivered the above notice with respect to such Prorated Item,
Buyer shall calculate (A) the Prorated Amount for such Prorated Item using the
actual available amounts (the "Actual Prorated Amount"), and (B) the absolute
value of the difference between the Estimated Prorated Amount and the Actual
Prorated Amount for such Prorated Item (the "Prorated Difference") and provide
Seller with such calculation, together with reasonable detail and supporting
material regarding the computation thereof (the "Proration Adjustment
Notice"). Subject to any dispute as to such amounts (which shall be resolved
pursuant to Section 2.8(d)), (i) if the Actual Prorated Amount (whether a
positive or a negative number) is greater than the Estimated Prorated Amount
(whether a positive or a negative number) for such Prorated Item, Buyer shall
pay an amount equal to the Prorated Difference to Seller within thirty (30)
days of the date of the Proration Adjustment Notice, or, in the case of a
dispute, within thirty (30) days of the date on which the Actual Prorated
Amount is finally determined in accordance with Section 2.8(d) or (ii) if the
Estimated Prorated Amount (whether a positive or a negative number) is greater
than the Actual Prorated Amount (whether a positive or a negative number) for
such Prorated Item, Seller shall pay an amount equal to the Prorated
Difference to Buyer within thirty (30) days of the date of the Proration
Adjustment Notice or, in the case of a dispute, within thirty (30) days of the
date on which the Actual Prorated Amount is finally determined in accordance
with Section 2.8(d). (d) In the event that Seller disagrees with the
computation of the Actual Prorated Amount for any Prorated Item to be
determined under this Section 2.8, Seller may provide a written notice of the
disagreement to Buyer within thirty (30) days after the date of the Proration
Adjustment Notice, and Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and
attempt to resolve their disagreement. Should such negotiations not result in
an agreement within twenty (20) days after delivery of such notice of
disagreement, then the matter shall be submitted to the Independent Accounting
Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm will deliver to Buyer and Seller a
written determination of the Actual Prorated Amount and the Prorated
Difference with respect to the disputed item (such determination to include a
worksheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such
determination and to be based solely on information provided to the
Independent Accounting Firm by Buyer and Seller) within thirty (30) days of
the submission of the dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm, which
determination will be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties. In
resolving any disagreement, the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign any
value to a disputed item greater than the greatest value claimed for such
disputed item by any Party or lesser than the lowest value claimed for such
disputed item by any Party. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if
any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this
Section 2.8(d) will be allocated between Seller

each shall prevail in respect of the dollar amount of disputed items so
submitted (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm). (e) If,

that is for the account of Buyer according to the terms of this Agreement,

other and, if applicable, the Independent Accounting Firm, with reasonable
access to such books, records and employees as are reasonably requested in

13 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 Section 2.11 Buyer Deliverables. At

such Assigned Contract at Closing. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer's
efforts shall include entering into a master agreement or similar enabling

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to the
extent that the sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or delivery
or attempted sale, sublease, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to
Buyer of any asset that would be a Transferred Asset (including any Assigned
Contracts) or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or
resulting therefrom is prohibited by any applicable Law or would require any
governmental or third party authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers
(including as described on Schedule 3.3), and such authorizations, approvals,
consents or waivers shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, the
Closing shall proceed without the sale, assignment, sublease, transfer,
conveyance or delivery of such asset as identified in writing by either Party
to the other Party, not less than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date,
unless such failure causes a failure of any of the conditions to Closing set
forth in Section 6.1(d), Section 6.1(e), Section 6.2(d) or Section 6.2(e), in
which event the Closing shall proceed only if the failed condition is waived
by the Party entitled to the benefit thereof in accordance with such closing
condition. In the event that the failed condition is waived and the Closing
proceeds without the transfer, sublease or assignment of any such asset, then
(i) such asset shall be regarded as a Transferred Asset for purposes of the
calculations required under Section 2.8 if such asset is a current asset and
(ii) following the Closing, the Parties shall continue to use their reasonable
best efforts, and cooperate with each other, to obtain promptly such
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers. Pending such authorization,
approval, consent or waiver, the Parties shall cooperate with each other in
any mutually agreeable, commercially reasonable and lawful back-to-back  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc015.jpg) 

14 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 arrangements designed to provide to
Buyer the benefits of use of such asset and to Seller or its Affiliates the
benefits, including any indemnities, that they would have obtained had the
asset been conveyed to Buyer at the Closing. Once authorization, approval,
consent or waiver for the sale, assignment, sublease, transfer, conveyance or
delivery of any such asset not sold, assigned, subleased, transferred,
conveyed or delivered at the Closing is obtained, Seller shall or shall cause
the relevant Affiliates to, assign, transfer, convey and deliver such asset to
Buyer at no additional cost. To the extent that any such asset cannot be
transferred or the full benefits of use of any such asset cannot be provided
to Buyer following the Closing pursuant to this Section 2.12, then Buyer and
Seller shall enter into such mutually agreeable, commercially reasonable and
lawful back-to-back arrangements (including subleasing, sublicensing or
subcontracting) to provide to the Parties substantially the same the economic
(taking into account Tax costs and benefits) and operational equivalent rights
and obligations, to the extent permitted, of obtaining such authorization,
approval, consent or waiver and the performance by Buyer of the obligations
thereunder. With respect to the foregoing back-to-back arrangements, Seller
shall hold in trust for and pay to Buyer promptly upon receipt thereof, all
income, proceeds and other monies received by Seller or any of its Affiliates
in connection with its use of any asset (net of any Taxes and any other costs
imposed upon Seller or any of its Affiliates) in connection with the
arrangements under this Section 2.12, which trust arrangement shall be
documented in any such back-to-back arrangements. For the avoidance of doubt,
it is specifically acknowledged and agreed by the Parties that neither Buyer
nor Seller shall be obligated to incur, pay, reimburse or provide or cause any
of their respective Affiliates to incur, pay, reimburse or provide, any
liability, compensation, consideration or charge to obtain the written consent
of any Counterparty to the assignment and assumption of any Assigned Contract.

Agreement and the consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated
hereby are within Buyer's powers and have been duly authorized by all
necessary action on the part of Buyer. This Agreement constitutes (assuming

legally binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance
with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or
affecting creditors' rights generally and general equitable principles
(whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). Section 4.3
Consents. Except for those Consents and Filings listed in Schedule 4.3, no
Consent of, or Filing with, any Governmental Entity which has not been
obtained or made by Buyer is required for or in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer, and the consummation by Buyer of the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than such Consents and Filings the
failure of which to obtain or make would not materially impair or delay the
ability of Buyer to effect the Closing. Buyer has no Knowledge of any facts or
circumstances relating to Buyer or its Affiliates that reasonably would be
likely to preclude or materially impair or delay either (i) the receipt of
such required consents or (ii) consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in accordance with its terms. Section 4.4 Noncontravention.

Permit or Order applicable to Buyer or by which Buyer is bound, or (iii)

4.3, contravene or violate any provision of, or result in the termination or
acceleration

not materially impair or delay the ability of Buyer to effect the Closing.
Section 4.5 Legal Proceedings. There are no Claims pending or, to Buyer's
Knowledge, threatened, against or otherwise relating to Buyer before any
Governmental Entity or any arbitrator that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer's
ability to perform its obligations hereunder. Buyer is not subject to any
Order that prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a material adverse effect on Buyer's ability to perform its
obligations hereunder. Section 4.6 Compliance with Laws. Buyer is not in
violation of any Law, except for violations that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect
on Buyer's ability to perform its obligations hereunder. Section 4.7 Brokers.
Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has any liability or obligation to pay
fees or commissions to any broker, finder or agent with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which Seller or its Affiliates

immediately available funds from the Guarantor, at the Closing will have all
funds necessary for its payment of the Purchase Price in accordance with
Section 2.5(a) and for all other actions necessary for Buyer to consummate the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement and perform its obligations
hereunder. Buyer understands that its obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the payment of all
amounts when due) are not subject to the availability to Buyer of any
financing (including from the Guarantor). Section 4.9 Investigation. Buyer is
a sophisticated entity, is knowledgeable about the industry in which Seller
operates, experienced in investments in such businesses and able to bear the
economic risk associated with the purchase of the Transferred Assets and the
Business. Buyer has such knowledge and experience as to be aware of the risks
and uncertainties inherent in the purchase of the Transferred Assets and the
Business and obligations of the type contemplated in this Agreement, as well
as the knowledge of the Seller and its operations in particular, and has
independently, based on such information made its own analysis and decision to
enter into this Agreement. Buyer had access to the books, records, facilities
and personnel of Seller for purposes of conducting its due diligence
investigation of Seller. Section 4.10 Disclaimer Regarding Projections. Buyer
may be in possession of certain plans, projections and other forecasts
regarding the Business. Buyer acknowledges that there are substantial
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such plans, projections and other
forecasts and plans and accordingly is not relying on them, that Buyer is
familiar with such uncertainties, that Buyer is taking full responsibility for
making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all plans,
projections and other forecasts so furnished to it, and that Buyer shall have
no claim against anyone with respect thereto. Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges
that, without limiting the generality of Section 4.10, neither Seller nor any

to Information. (a) During the Interim Period, Seller shall provide Buyer and
its Representatives with information as to the Transferred Assets, the
Business and its operations as reasonably requested by Buyer and to the extent
such information is readily available or could be obtained without any
material interference with the Business, it being understood that, in
connection with the foregoing, Buyer shall be entitled, at its expense, to
have the Real Property surveyed for purposes of obtaining American Land Title
Association land title surveys or other forms of surveys. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall not be required to permit or authorize any invasive or
destructive environmental investigation, testing or sampling of any property
or facility of Seller or provide any information which Seller reasonably
believes it is prohibited from providing to Buyer by reason of any applicable
Law or Permit, which constitutes or allows access to information protected by
attorney/client privilege, or which Seller is required to keep confidential or
prevent access to by reason of any Contract with a third party.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein, Buyer shall not be permitted during
the Interim Period to contact any of Seller's vendors, customers or suppliers,
or any Governmental Entities (except in connection with applications for
governmental approvals in connection with this Agreement) regarding the
operations or legal status of Seller or with respect to the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement without receiving prior written authorization
from Seller. (b) On or as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing
Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer all of the Books and Records, except as
prohibited by applicable Law. Following the Closing, Seller shall be entitled
to retain copies (at Seller's sole cost and expense) of all Books and Records.
(c) After the Closing, Buyer will, and will cause its Representatives to,
afford to Seller and its Affiliates, including their respective
Representatives, reasonable access to (or, at  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc027.jpg) 

26 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 Buyer's option, copies of) all books,
records, files and documents to the extent they are related to the Business,
the Transferred Assets or any Retained Liabilities and to periods ending prior
to the Closing Date, subject to Seller's obligation to keep such books,
records, files and documents confidential in accordance with Section 5.4, in
order to permit Seller and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives
to prepare and file their Tax Returns and to prepare for and participate in
any investigation with respect thereto, to prepare for and participate in any
other investigation and defend any Claims relating to or involving Seller or
its Affiliates, to discharge its obligations under this Agreement, to comply
with financial reporting requirements, and for other reasonable purposes, and
will afford Seller and its Affiliates reasonable assistance in connection
therewith. Buyer will cause such records to be maintained for not less than
seven years from the Closing Date and will not dispose of such records without
first offering in writing to deliver them to Seller; provided, however, that
in the event that Buyer transfers all or a portion of the Business or the
Transferred Assets to any third party during such period, Buyer may transfer
to such third party all or a portion of the books, records, files and
documents related thereto, provided such third party transferee expressly
assumes in writing the obligations of Buyer under this Section 5.1(c). In
addition, on and after the Closing Date, at the request of either Party, the
other Party shall make available to such requesting Party, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives, those employees of the non-requesting Party
requested by such requesting Party in connection with any Claim, including to
provide testimony, to be deposed, to act as witnesses and to assist counsel;
provided, however, that (i) such access to such employees shall not
unreasonably interfere with the normal conduct of the operations of the non-
requesting Party, (ii) the requesting Party shall reimburse the non-requesting
Party for the out-of-pocket costs reasonably incurred by the non-requesting
Party in making such employees available to the requesting Party and its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives, and (iii) such assistance
shall be provided insofar as the same may be provided without violating any
Law or Permit or waiving any attorney-client privilege, as determined in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the non- requesting Party. Section 5.2
Conduct of Business Pending the Closing. (a) During the Interim Period and
except as set forth in Schedule 5.2(a), Seller shall maintain its Business in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve intact, maintain and protect the
Business and Transferred Assets, in each case in compliance in all material
respects with applicable Permits and Laws. Without limiting the foregoing,
during the Interim Period, except (w) as otherwise expressly contemplated by
this Agreement, (x) as set forth in Schedule 5.2(a), (y) as required by any
applicable Law, Permit, Order, Benefit Plan or Material Contract or (z) as
consented to by Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates not to, with respect to the Business: (i) sell, dispose of or lease
any Transferred Assets (including any Real Property), other than sales or
dispositions of obsolete or surplus assets or in connection with the normal
repair or replacement of assets or properties, not in excess of $150,000
individually or $750,000 in the aggregate;  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc028.jpg) 

27 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 (ii) merge or consolidate with any
other Person or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any other
Person or enter into any joint venture, partnership or similar venture with
any other Person; (iii) liquidate, dissolve, reorganize or otherwise wind up
the Business; (iv) (A) terminate the employment of any Company Employee (other
than for cause), (B) transfer or relocate any Company Employee in a manner
that causes the person to cease to be a Company Employee, (C) hire any person
to become a Company Employee (except in replacement of a Company Employee
whose employment with Seller has been terminated or otherwise in the ordinary
course of business), or (D) except in the ordinary course of business or for
the payment of accrued or earned but unpaid bonuses, materially increase the
compensation or employee benefits of any Company Employee; (v) create, incur,
assume, guarantee or otherwise become liable with respect to any indebtedness
for money borrowed in a way which would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any Assumed Liability or to adversely affect title to, rights to, use of or
operation of any Transferred Asset; (vi) settle or compromise any claim
whether brought by or against the Seller with respect to the Business or the
Transferred Assets which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Assumed Liability, other than settlements or compromises involving solely the
payment of money damages not in excess of $150,000 individually or $750,000 in
the aggregate which is to be paid following Closing; (vii) enter into, assign
or terminate, or amend or waive any material term under, any Material Contract
other than in the ordinary course of business; (viii) place any Lien on any of
the Transferred Assets (other than Permitted Liens); or (ix) agree or commit
to do any of the foregoing. (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.2
to the contrary, Seller may take commercially reasonable actions with respect
to emergency situations or to comply with applicable Laws or Permits;
provided, however, that Seller shall provide Buyer with notice of such
emergency situation and any such action as soon as reasonably practicable and
nothing in this Section 5.2 shall be deemed to waive any breach or violation
by Seller of any other representation or warranty under this Agreement as a
result of such action. Section 5.3 Support Obligations. (a) Buyer recognizes
that Seller or certain of its Affiliates have provided guarantees or other
credit support with respect to the Business or the Transferred Assets to third
parties, all of which that are outstanding as of the date hereof are set forth
on Schedule 5.3(a)  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc029.jpg) 

28 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 (the "Support Obligations"). True,
correct and complete copies of all such Support Obligations as of the date of
this Agreement have been made available to Buyer. (b) Prior to the Closing,
Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to replace the Support
Obligations, and Seller and Buyer shall cooperate, and each shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, to effect the full and unconditional release,
effective as of the Closing Date, of Seller or the applicable Affiliate from
all Support Obligations and all obligations and liabilities in respect
thereof, in the case of Buyer, by (among other things): (i) furnishing a
letter of credit to replace each existing letter of credit that is a Support
Obligation containing terms and conditions that are substantially similar to
the terms and conditions of such existing letter of credit; (ii) providing a
guaranty from a creditworthy party to replace each existing guaranty that is a
Support Obligation containing terms and conditions that are substantially
similar to the terms and conditions of such existing guaranty; or (iii)
replacing any other security agreement or arrangement on substantially similar
terms and conditions to the existing security agreement or arrangement that is
a Support Obligation. In each case, Buyer shall ensure any credit support
provided pursuant to this Section 5.3(b) satisfies all of the credit support
provisions of the applicable Contract. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
specifically acknowledged and agreed by the Parties that Seller shall not be
obligated to incur, pay, reimburse or provide or cause any of their respective
Affiliates to incur, pay, reimburse or provide, any liability, compensation,
consideration or charge in order to replace the Support Obligations (and
neither Buyer nor Seller shall be obligated to pay any consent or similar
fee). (c) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate, and each shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts, to cause the beneficiary or beneficiaries of
such Support Obligations to (i) remit any cash and cash equivalents (including
any interest payable thereon) to Seller or the applicable Affiliate of Seller
held under any escrow or cash collateral arrangement that is a Support
Obligation promptly following the replacement of such escrow or cash
collateral arrangement pursuant to Section 5.3(b)(iii) and (ii) terminate,
surrender and redeliver to Seller or the applicable Affiliate of Seller or
Seller's other designee each original copy of each guaranty, letter of credit,
bond, surety or other instrument constituting or evidencing such Support
Obligations. (d) If Buyer and Seller are unable to obtain the full and
unconditional release of Seller and any applicable Affiliate of Seller from
any Support Obligation as of the Closing pursuant to Section 5.3(b) (each such
unreleased Support Obligation, until such time as it is released in accordance
with Section 5.3, a "Continuing Support Obligation"): (i) from and after the
Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall continue to cooperate, and each shall
continue to use the same efforts required under Section 5.3(b) with respect to
the pre-Closing period, to obtain promptly the full and unconditional  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc030.jpg) 

29 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 release of Seller and its Affiliates
from each Continuing Support Obligation and evidence reasonably satisfactory
to Seller or such Affiliate of each such release; (ii) Buyer shall indemnify
Seller and any applicable Affiliates of Seller from and against any
liabilities, losses and reasonable costs or expenses (including any issuance,
amendment or maintenance fees and expenses) incurred by Seller and any such
Affiliate of Seller in connection with each Continuing Support Obligation
(including reimbursement immediately following demand therefor with respect to
any demand or draw upon, or withdrawal from, any Continuing Support
Obligation); (iii) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
effect any material amendments or modifications or any other changes to the
contracts or obligations to which any of the Continuing Support Obligations
relate, assign, authorize or transfer to a third party any contracts or
obligations to which any of the Continuing Support Obligations relate, or to
otherwise take any action that could increase, extend or accelerate the
Liability of Seller or its applicable Affiliate under any Continuing Support
Obligation, without Seller's prior written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; and (iv) to the extent that Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller has any performance obligations under any Continuing
Support Obligations from and after the Closing, Buyer shall (A) at Seller's
request and without creating any agency relationship or agency liability in
respect thereof perform such obligations of Seller or such Affiliate of Seller
to the maximum extent practicable, or (B) otherwise take such actions as may
be requested from time to time by Seller or the applicable Affiliate of Seller
so as to put Seller or such Affiliate of Seller in the same position as if
Buyer had performed or was performing such obligations. Section 5.4
Confidentiality; Publicity. (a) Prior to Closing, no Party will make any
public announcement or issue any public communication regarding this Agreement
or the proposed transaction, or any matter related to the foregoing, without
the prior written consent of the other Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld), except if such announcement or other communication is required by
applicable Law or Permit (including any rules of an applicable securities
exchange), in which case the disclosing Party shall, as permitted by
applicable Law or Permit, first allow the other Party at least one Business
Day to review such announcement or communication and the opportunity to
comment thereon. The confidentiality provisions set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement shall be incorporated herein, with effect from the
date hereof until the earlier to occur of (i) the Closing, or (ii) two years
from the date hereof. (b) Buyer acknowledges that all information provided to
it and to any of its Affiliates, or their respective Representatives, by
Seller and its Affiliates or their respective Representatives is subject to
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of which are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement by reference; provided, that if there is any
inconsistency between the express terms of this Agreement and the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, then the terms of this Agreement shall control and
govern to the extent of such inconsistency.

Exhibit E. From and after the Closing Date, the Post-Closing Confidentiality
Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings between the Parties with respect to matters
related to confidentiality. Section 5.5 Expenses. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, each Party will pay its own costs and
expenses incurred in anticipation of, relating to and in connection with the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated

all filing fees required by Governmental Entities with respect to Filings or
Consents, including filing fees in connection with filings under the HSR Act.
Section 5.6 Regulatory and Other Approvals and Consents. (a) During the
Interim Period, the Parties will, in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and except to the extent a different standard is specified
in another provision of this Agreement, (i) proceed diligently and in good
faith and use all commercially reasonable efforts, as promptly as practicable,
to obtain the Consents and Filings listed in Schedule 3.3 and Schedule 4.3, in
each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Seller and Buyer,
and to make all required filings with, and to give all required notices to,
the applicable Governmental Entities and (ii) cooperate in good faith with the
applicable Governmental Entities or other Persons and provide promptly such
other information and communications to such Governmental Entities or other
Persons as such Governmental Entities or other Persons may reasonably request
in connection therewith. (b) During the Interim Period, the Parties will
provide prompt notification to each other when any such approval referred to
in Section 5.6(a) is obtained, taken, made, given or denied, as applicable,
and will advise each other of any material communications with any
Governmental Entity or other Person regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. (c) In furtherance of the foregoing covenants:
(i) Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to make
an appropriate filing of a "Notification and Report Form" pursuant to the HSR
Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby within 30 days
following the execution of this Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall supply as
promptly as practicable any additional information or documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable. Buyer and Seller
shall comply substantially with any additional requests for information,
including requests for production of documents and production of witnesses for
interviews or depositions, made by the Antitrust Division of the United States

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc032.jpg) 

31 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 commercially reasonable actions to
obtain clearance from the Antitrust Authorities. Buyer shall exercise its
commercially reasonable efforts, and Seller shall cooperate fully with Buyer,
to prevent the entry in any Claim brought by an Antitrust Authority or any
Governmental Entity of an Order that would prohibit, make unlawful or delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (ii)
Other than with respect to filings under the HSR Act, Buyer and Seller will,
as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event more than 30 days following
the execution of this Agreement, prepare and file with each applicable
Governmental Entity requests for such Consents as may be necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, including approvals under Section 203 of the FPA and
Buyer's application to FERC for market-based rate authorization. Buyer and
Seller will diligently pursue and use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such Consents and will cooperate with each other in seeking such
Consents. To such end, the parties agree to make available the personnel and
other resources of their respective organizations in order to obtain all such
Consents. Each Party will promptly inform the other Parties of any material
communication received by such Party from, or given by such party to, any
Governmental Entity from which any such Consent is required and of any
material communication received or given in connection with any Claim by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and will permit the other party to review any communication given by
it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference
with, any such Governmental Entity or, in connection with any Claim by a
private party, with such other Person, and to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity or other Person, give the other party the opportunity to
attend and to participate in such meetings and conferences. (d)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer agrees that
the making of any required Filings or the obtaining of any required Consents
with or from any Governmental Entity, are the responsibility of Buyer, and
that Buyer shall take, or cause to be taken, all commercially reasonable
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable to make such Filings or obtain such Consents with or from
any Governmental Entity as are required in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the foregoing, from the
date hereof through the Closing Date, Buyer agrees that except as may be
agreed in writing by Seller, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any action,
which could reasonably be expected to impact the ability of the Parties to
secure all required Filings or Consents with or from any Governmental Entity
to consummate the transactions hereunder, or take any action with any
Governmental Entity relating to the foregoing, or agree, in writing or
otherwise, to do any of the foregoing, in each case which could reasonably be
expected to delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or result in the failure to satisfy any condition to consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Section 5.7 Seller Marks. (a) As soon as
reasonably practicable but in no event more than 30 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall: (i) cease using any names, marks, trade names, trademarks

32 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 corporate symbols and logos
incorporating "Talen", "PPL" or any word or expression similar thereto or
constituting an abbreviation or extension thereof (collectively and together
with all other names, marks, trade names, trademarks and corporate symbols and
logos owned by Seller or any of its Affiliates, the "Seller Marks"); and (ii),
if applicable, remove from the Transferred Assets any and all Seller Marks.
Thereafter, Buyer shall not use any Seller Mark or any name or term
confusingly similar to any Seller Mark in connection with the sale of any
products or services, in the corporate or doing business name of any of its
Affiliates or otherwise in the conduct of its or any of its Affiliates'
businesses or operations. (b) In the event that Buyer breaches this Section
5.7, Seller shall be entitled to specific performance of this Section 5.7 and
to injunctive relief against further violations, as well as any other remedies
at law or in equity available to Seller; provided, however that to the extent
necessary Buyer may have up to 90 days after the Closing Date in order to
remove from the Transferred Assets any and all Seller Marks. Section 5.8 Surge
Tank Rehabilitation. (a) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Seller
shall enter into an agreement with a contractor to complete the Surge Tank
Rehabilitation, (the "Surge Tank Rehabilitation Contract") which such
agreement shall include a budget of expected payments (the "Surge Tank
Budgeted Amount"); provided that Seller shall not enter into the Surge Tank
Rehabilitation Contract without the prior written consent of Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. (b) During
the Interim Period, any modification to the Surge Tank Rehabilitation Contract
that increases or decreases the Surge Tank Budgeted Amount shall require the
prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. (c) If applicable, from and after Closing
until the completion of the Surge Tank Rehabilitation, any modification to the
Surge Tank Rehabilitation Contract that increases or decreases the Surge Tank
Budgeted Amount shall require the prior written consent of Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Section
5.9 Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, all Transfer Taxes shall be paid by Buyer. Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate in timely making all filings, Tax Returns, reports and forms as may
be required to comply with the provisions of such Tax laws. Section 5.10
Employee, Labor and Benefits Matters. (a) Benefit Plans. Seller shall take, or
cause to be taken, all actions required so that from and after each
Transferred Employee's Transfer Date, no Transferred Employee shall have any
right to accrue any further benefits, or any right to continue as active
participants under the Benefit Plans (except to the extent required by COBRA,
and except to the extent that any group medical, dental, prescription drug or
vision care benefits under any Benefit Plans  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc034.jpg) 

33 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 continue to be available, by their
express terms, through the end of the calendar month in which the Closing Date
occurs). (b) Offers of Employment. No later than five (5) days prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer shall provide to each Company Employee a written offer of
employment with Buyer for the same or a comparable position and, other than
any such employee who is on long-term disability or non-protected leave,
reflecting terms consistent with this Section 5.10 and with such offers to be
contingent upon (i) the Company Employee remaining employed by Seller until
the Closing Date, (ii) the consummation of the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement and (iii) the Company Employee actually commencing employment
with Buyer on or, with respect to any Company Employee on protected leave as
of the Closing Date, within three (3) months following the Closing Date. Each
Company Employee who accepts such offers of employment prior to the Closing
Date and actually commences employment with Buyer effective upon the Closing
Date (or, in the case of a Company Employee not actively at work on the
Closing Date, within three (3) months following the Closing Date shall be
considered "Transferred Employees"); provided, that each Transferred Employee
who does not commence active employment with Buyer until after the Closing
Date shall first be considered a Transferred Employee on such day of active
employment (each respective Transferred Employee's first day of employment
with Buyer, the "Transfer Date"). To the extent that Buyer provides a written
offer of employment to a Company Employee that does not comply with the terms
required by this Section 5.10 and for that reason Seller incurs any severance
obligations (including COBRA), Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
with respect to any such severance obligations arising out of such non-
compliant offer. (c) Collective Bargaining Agreements. Buyer or its
Affiliates, as appropriate, will acknowledge the Union, as the collective
bargaining representatives of all Transferred Employees represented by the
Union (the "Union Employees"). Buyer shall abide by the terms of the CBA in
accordance with Law during the remaining term of the CBA. Buyer agrees to
engage in any type of bargaining that is required under the CBA and applicable
Law with the Union. Buyer agrees that Buyer shall be responsible for, and
Buyer covenants to pay or otherwise discharge, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless Seller and its Affiliates against, any liability, claim or obligation
(including attorney's fees and other costs of defense) resulting from Buyer's
or any of its Affiliate's failure to provide compensation or benefits from and
after the Closing Date that are required to be provided under the CBA. For the
avoidance of doubt, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer assumes full
responsibility to provide (or cause its Affiliates to provide) any severance
or termination pay benefits that may be required to be provided under the CBA
or otherwise arising from Buyer's or its Affiliates' actions or omissions on
or after the Closing. With respect to the Union Employees, the obligations of
Buyer and its Affiliates set forth in this Section 5.10 shall be subject to
the terms of the CBA and all applicable labor and employment Law requirements.
(d) Post-Closing Compensation and Benefits. Effective on each respective
Transferred Employee's Transfer Date, and for a period of not less than
twenty-four (24) months following such Transfer Date, Buyer shall provide each
Transferred Employee that is not a Union Employee (collectively, the "Non-
Union Employees") with (i) base salary and incentive compensation
opportunities that are no less favorable than those provided to such Non-Union  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc035.jpg) 

34 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) employee benefits (including, without limitation,
pension, savings, health, vision, dental, disability and life insurance
benefits, as well as vacation, time off, sick and holiday pay programs) that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such Non-Union
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, it being understood, however,
that Seller shall not be required to replicate the employee benefits provided
to each Transferred Employee prior to the Closing Date. (e) Severance. Without
limiting the generality of the provisions of Section 5.10(d), from and after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide severance pay and benefits to each Non-
Union Employee whose employment terminates or is terminated without cause on
or during the twenty-four (24)-month period following the Closing Date which
are no less favorable than the greater of (i) those set forth in the severance
program listed on Schedule 5.10(e) and (ii) the severance program provided by
Buyer to similarly-situated employees of Buyer (taking into account subsequent
increases in compensation and service). As a condition of any such severance
benefits, Buyer shall require that eligible employees execute (and not revoke)
a general release of all claims against Seller, Buyer and their respective
Affiliates. (f) Service Credit. With respect to any incentive, compensation or
employee benefit arrangements as may be maintained for the Non-Union Employees
from time to time following the Closing Date by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including without limitation plans or policies providing severance benefits,
vacation entitlement, and sick pay), service by Non- Union Employees performed
for Seller or any of its Affiliates (or a predecessor to either such entity's
business or assets) shall be treated as service with Buyer and its Affiliates,
for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit
accruals and determination of the level of benefits under any employee benefit
plans or arrangements that such Non-Union Employees may be eligible to
participate in after the Closing Date for such Non-Union Employee's service
with Seller to the same extent recognized by Seller immediately prior to such
Transferred Employee's Transfer Date; provided, however, that such service
need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits. (g) Medical and Welfare Plan Obligations. (i) Buyer
agrees to waive any waiting periods or limitations for preexisting conditions
for each Non-Union Employee under the medical and pharmacy benefit programs of
Buyer made available to such Non-Union Employees on or following each
Transferred Employee's Transfer Date, to the same extent such periods or
limitations would have been or were waived by Seller and its Affiliates for
the same purpose under the comparable type of medical or pharmacy benefit
program in which such Non-Union Employee was participating or eligible to
participate immediately prior to such Transferred Employee's respective
Transfer Date. Buyer further agrees to credit each Non-Union Employee for
amounts paid by such or Non-Union Employee under the medical or pharmacy
benefit program in which such Non-Union Employee was participating immediately
prior to such Transferred Employee's respective Transfer Date towards
satisfaction of the applicable deductibles and out-of-pocket limits under the
comparable type of medical or pharmacy benefit program of Buyer or its
Affiliates in which such Non-Union Employee first participates on or after
each Transferred Employee's respective Transfer Date, to the same extent such
credit was given under the  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc036.jpg) 

35 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 applicable medical or pharmacy benefit
program, and in each case in respect of the plan year in which occurs
Transferred Employee's respective Transfer Date. (ii) Buyer shall honor all
vacation, personal and sick days accrued by such Non-Union Employees under the
plans, policies, programs and arrangements of Seller or any of its Affiliates
(or a predecessor to either such entity's business or assets) immediately
prior to each Transferred Employee's respective Transfer Date. (iii) Buyer
shall provide continuation health care coverage to Non-Union Employees and
their respective qualified beneficiaries who incur a qualifying event, in
accordance with the continuation health care coverage requirements of Section
4980B of the Code and Title I, Subtitle B, Part 6 of ERISA and any similar
state local law ("COBRA") on or after the Transferred Employee`s respective
Transfer Date. (iv) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.10, (i)
Seller and its Affiliates shall be solely liable for any claims for welfare
benefits that are incurred by or with respect to any Non-Union Employee and
his or her beneficiaries or dependents under a Benefit Plan on or before the
Transferred Employee`s respective Transfer Date and (ii) Buyer shall be solely
liable for any claims for welfare benefits that are incurred by or with
respect to any Non-Union Employee and his or her beneficiaries or dependents
after the Transferred Employee`s respective Transfer Date. For purposes of the
foregoing, the following claims and liabilities shall be deemed to be incurred
as follows: (x) life, accidental death and dismemberment and business travel
accident insurance benefits, upon the death, disability or accident giving
rise to such benefits, (y) hospital- provided health, dental, prescription
drug or other benefits, which become payable with respect to any hospital
confinement, upon commencement of such confinement, and (z) medical, dental,
and vision, when the services are rendered, the supplies are provided or
prescribed medication is acquired by the participant, and not when the
condition arose. (h) Post-Retirement Benefits. Seller's Affiliates currently
sponsor retiree health programs (the "Seller Retiree Plans") for current and
former Company Employees (and beneficiaries thereof) who meet (or met) the
plans' applicable eligibility requirements. Seller and its Affiliates shall
retain all responsibility and Liabilities for the Seller Retiree Plans,
whether arising before, on or after the Closing Date. (i) Pension Plan. Each
Non-Union Employee who has accrued a benefit under the Seller's Affiliates'
defined benefit plan (the "Seller Pension Plan") shall, as of each Transferred
Employee's Transfer Date, for purposes of the Seller Pension Plan, be treated
as having incurred a "termination of employment" and a "separation from
service" with respect to the Seller Pension Plan. The accrued benefit of each
Non-Union Employee under the Seller Pension Plan shall be fully vested and
nonforfeitable as of such Transferred Employee's Transfer Date. Seller shall
amend the documents that comprise the Seller Pension Plan as it deems, in its
sole discretion, are necessary and appropriate to reflect the foregoing. (j)
401(k) Plan.  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc037.jpg) 

36 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 (i) From and after the Closing Date,
Buyer agrees to cause one or more defined contribution plans that are
maintained or contributed to by Buyer or one of its Affiliates that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and tax- exempt
under Section 501(a) of the Code ("Buyer's 401(k) Plan") to provide each Non-
Union Employee an opportunity to make a direct rollover to Buyer's 401(k) Plan
of an eligible distribution from the 401(k) plans of Seller or any of its
Affiliates ("Seller's 401(k) Plans") that includes promissory notes reflecting
such Non-Union Employee's then outstanding participant loans under Seller's
401(k) Plans. (ii) Seller and the Seller's 401(k) Plans shall not place any
Non-Union Employee's loan into default on account of the actions contemplated
by this Agreement, so long as such Non-Union Employee transfers such Non-Union
Employee's account balance under the Seller's 401(k) Plans, together with the
loan, to Buyer's 401(k) Plan through a direct rollover. (k) Workers
Compensation Insurance. Beginning at the Closing, all Transferred Employees
shall be eligible for coverage under workers' compensation insurance provided
by Buyer or its Affiliates. (l) WARN Obligations. Buyer shall indemnify,
defend, and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless from and against any and
all Liabilities and claims (including attorney's fees and other costs of
defense) arising out of or otherwise in respect of (A) a termination of the
employment of any Company Employee that occurs on or after the Closing Date,
or (B) any suit or claim of violation brought against Seller or any of its
Affiliates under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, 29
U.S.C. § 2101, et seq., or any state or local plant closing or severance law
(collectively, "WARN") for any actions taken by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
on or after the Closing Date with regard to any site of employment, facility,
operating unit or Company Employee affected by this Agreement. (m) No
Amendments; No Third Party Beneficiaries. All provisions contained in this
Section 5.10 are included for the sole benefit of the Parties to this
Agreement, and nothing herein, whether express or implied, shall create any
third party beneficiary or other rights (1) in any other Person, including,
without limitation, any current or former employee, any participant in any
Benefit Plan, or any dependent, alternative payee or beneficiary thereof, or
(2) to continued employment with Seller, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates or continued participation in any Benefit Plan. Section 5.11 Tax
Matters. (a) With respect to any Straddle Taxable Period, the amount of Taxes
allocable to the portion of the Straddle Taxable Period ending as of the
Effective Time for purposes of the definitions of Assumed Liabilities,
Excluded Assets and Retained Liabilities shall be deemed to be the amount of
such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on
an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding
period) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the Straddle Taxable Period ending as of the Effective Time
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
relevant Straddle Taxable Period.  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc038.jpg) 

37 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 (b) Subject to Section 5.11(c), with
respect to any Tax or Damage relating to Taxes for which Seller is responsible
pursuant to Section 7.2(a), Seller shall have the right, at its sole cost and
expense, to initiate any claim for refund or credit and to control the
prosecution, settlement or compromise of any Claim involving such Tax or
Damage; provided, however, that Seller may not agree to settle any Claim that
could affect any Taxes for which Buyer may be liable without the prior written
consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Buyer and Seller shall give written notice to the
other Party of its receipt of any notice of any audit, examination, claim or
assessment for any Tax for which the other Party may be responsible within
fifteen (15) days after its receipt of such notice; failure to give any such
written notice within such 15-day period shall cause such other Party to
forfeit any rights it may have by reason of Section 3.15 or this Section 5.11
only to the extent such other Party is prejudiced by such failure. (c)
Notwithstanding Section 5.11(b), Seller and Buyer shall jointly control and
participate in all proceedings taken in connection with any Claim relating to
Taxes for a Straddle Taxable Period, and shall bear their own respective costs
and expenses. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall settle any such Claim relating to
a Straddle Taxable Period without the prior written consent of the other, such
consent not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall cede control to Seller of any
action related to a recapture of a Treasury Cash Grant upon Seller's agreement
to fully indemnify Buyer for any amount of such recapture. (d) Seller shall
grant to Buyer (or its designees) access at all reasonable times after the
Closing to all of the information, books and records specifically relating to
the Business or any Transferred Assets within the possession of Seller
(including workpapers and correspondence with Taxing Authorities), and shall
afford Buyer (or its designees) the right (at Buyer's expense) to take
extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably
necessary to permit Buyer (or its designees) to prepare Tax Returns, respond
to Tax audits and investigations, prosecute Tax protests, appeals and refund
claims and to conduct negotiations with Taxing Authorities. Buyer shall grant
to Seller (or its designees) access at all reasonable times after the Closing
to all of the information, books and records specifically relating to the
Business or any Transferred Assets within the possession of Buyer (including
workpapers and correspondence with Taxing Authorities), and shall afford
Seller (or its designees) the right (at Seller's expense) to take extracts
therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to
permit Seller (or its designees) to prepare Tax Returns, respond to Tax audits
and investigations, prosecute protests, appeals and refund claims with respect
to Taxes and to conduct negotiations with Taxing Authorities. After the
Closing Date, each of Seller and Buyer will preserve all information, records
or documents in their respective possessions relating to liabilities for Taxes
of the Business or any Transferred Assets until six months after the
expiration of any applicable statute of limitations (including extensions
thereof) with respect to the assessment of such Taxes. Section 5.12 Bulk Sales
Laws. The Parties agree to waive the applicability of any provisions of any

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc039.jpg) 

38 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each of Buyer and Seller agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts (except where a different efforts standard is
specifically contemplated by this Agreement, in which case such different
standard shall apply) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that
in no event shall any Party be required to take any action which (i) in the
opinion of its counsel, is unlawful or would or could constitute a violation
of any applicable Law or (ii) could reasonably be expected to prevent or
materially impede, interfere with or delay the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. (b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at
any time and from time to time after the Closing, at any Party's request and
without further consideration, the other Party shall execute and deliver to
such requesting Party such other instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance,
assignment and confirmation, provide such materials and information and take
such other actions as such Party may reasonably request in order to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 5.14 FERC Boundary
Issues; Buyer's Title Insurance; Liens. (a) Seller shall deliver to Buyer as
promptly as reasonably practical after the date of this Agreement a
description of the real property owned in fee by Seller which straddles the
FERC-approved boundaries for the Facilities. Buyer and Seller agree and
acknowledge that as of the date of this Agreement, there is no legal
separation between the FERC Boundary Owned Real Property and the Non-FERC
Boundary Owned Real Property, and that further work is necessary to effect
that separation to permit Seller to convey title to the FERC Boundary Owned
Real Property pursuant to the Deeds, which might include additional surveying
work, subdivision of plots or other actions. Both Parties agree to cooperate
with each other and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
effect such separation as promptly as reasonable practicable after the date of
this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that
in order to complete such work expeditiously, it may be necessary or advisable
to convey some real property outside of the FERC-approved boundaries for the
Facilities as within the defined area of the term "FERC Boundary Owned Real
Property", including to avoid any material delay to Closing as part of any
subdivision of plots. In the event the Parties agree, as aforementioned or
otherwise, that any real property outside of the FERC- approved boundaries for
the Facilities will be conveyed to Buyer as of the Closing, the term "FERC
Boundary Owned Real Property" as used herein shall be deemed to include all
such additional real property, and the Parties agree that the Deeds to be
delivered to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.10(a) shall be revised as necessary
to reflect the conveyance of any such additional real property.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.14(a), in no event
shall Seller convey to Buyer any real property outside of the FERC-approved
boundaries for the Facilities that includes any real property located on
Schedule 5.14(a). In connection with the legal separation of the FERC Boundary
Owned Real Property and the Non-FERC Boundary Owned Real Property, both
Parties agree to work together in good faith to enter into mutually agreeable
easement agreements as may be necessary to establish uninterrupted access to a
public roadway from (i) the FERC Boundary Owned Real Property and (ii) the
non-FERC Boundary  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc040.jpg) 

39 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 Owned Real Property, which such
easements shall in no event burden any real property located on Schedule
5.14(a). (b) As of the date of this Agreement, Buyer has obtained title
insurance commitments from the Title Insurer that include commitments to
provide insurance coverage of the FERC Boundary Owned Real Property, attached
hereto as Exhibit G (the "Title Insurance Commitments"). At Closing, Seller
shall deliver to the Title Insurer owner's affidavits with respect to the FERC
Boundary Owned Real Property and other matters in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit F (the "Owner's Affidavits") and, on and prior to Closing, Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) provide available documents
and other information as reasonably necessary to comply with the requirements
set forth in Schedule B Section 1 of the Title Insurance Commitments that are
applicable to Seller as set forth on Schedule 5.14(b) and (y) provide
available and up-to-date lien waivers from third party contractors with
respect to capital expenditure projects and other works undertaken or ongoing
at the Facilities which may give rise to possible unfiled mechanics, workmen,
repairmen, warehousemen, carriers or other similar Liens; provided that, with
respect to clause (x) above, Seller shall not be required to (i) undertake any
obligation or incur any liability with respect to Permitted Liens or (ii)
undertake or incur any liability under, or provide any information in
connection with, any certificate in excess of any express liability or
obligation that it would otherwise have under this Agreement. Buyer expressly
acknowledges and agrees that all title commitments, Title Policies and surveys
required in connection therewith shall be obtained at Buyer's sole cost and
expense. (c) On or prior to Closing, (i) as reasonably required by the Title
Insurer as a condition to issuing the Title Policy as of the Closing, Seller
shall remove or otherwise reasonably satisfy the Title Insurer's requirements
with respect to the issuance of such Title Policy with respect to any Lien
(other than a Permitted Lien within the meaning of clause (b) of the
definition of such term) that constitutes a mechanics', workmen's,
repairmen's, warehousemen's, carriers' or other like Lien, including (if
applicable) bonding over such Lien; and (ii) Seller shall remove all
mortgages, mechanics' liens, judgments and all other monetary liens identified
on Schedule 5.14(c) or otherwise take such actions as specified on such
schedule with respect to the applicable Lien listed thereon. Section 5.15
Treasury Cash Grant Matters. (a) Subject to the other terms of this Agreement,
Buyer agrees to be jointly and severally liable with Seller for any
"recapture" within the meaning of Section 1603 and the Treasury Guidance, of
the Treasury Cash Grant. (b) Neither Buyer nor Seller (nor any of their
Affiliates) shall take any action which reasonably could be expected to, or
actually does, result in any "recapture" within the meaning of Section 1603
and the Treasury Guidance. (c) Buyer shall, during the period ending on
November 25, 2018, operate the Facilities in compliance with the restrictions
and covenants set forth in this Agreement with respect to the Treasury Cash
Grant. Buyer shall comply with the annual performance report and certification
requirements for purposes of the Treasury Cash Grant. Seller shall provide
Buyer with any information requested by Buyer that is reasonably necessary to
allow Buyer to comply

40 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 with the annual performance report and
certification requirements for purposes of the Treasury Cash Grant and Buyer
shall provide to Seller copies of such annual performance report and
certifications as filed. Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable efforts to
cooperate in making any filings related to the Treasury Cash Grant. ARTICLE VI

specified date earlier than the Closing Date, on and as of such earlier date;
(ii) caused by, resulting from or arising out of any breach by Seller of any
of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or (iii) caused
by, resulting from or arising out of the Retained Liabilities. (b)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 7.2, the
Indemnified Buyer Entities shall be entitled to indemnification with respect
to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i): (i) only if
the amount of Damages with respect to such claim (aggregating all Damages with
respect to claims arising from substantially identical facts) exceeds the
amount of $100,000 (any claim involving Damages equal to or less than such
amount being referred to as a "De Minimis Claim"); (ii) only if, and then only
to the extent that, the aggregate Damages to all Indemnified Buyer Entities,
with respect to all claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i)
(other than all De Minimis Claims), exceed the amount of one percent (1%) of
the Base Purchase Price (the "Deductible"), whereupon (subject to the
provisions of clause (iii) below) Seller shall be obligated to pay in full all
such amounts but only to the extent such aggregate Damages are in excess of
one half percent (0.5%) of the Base Purchase Price and other than in respect
to any De Minimis Claim; and (iii) only with respect to claims for
indemnification under Section 7.2(a)(i) made on or before the expiration of
the survival period pursuant to Section 7.1 for the applicable representation
or warranty. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 7.2, in no event shall the Indemnified Buyer Entities be entitled to
aggregate Damages pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) in excess of the amount of
twenty percent (20%)of the Base Purchase Price (the "Cap"). Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 7.2 to the contrary, a De Minimis Claim, the
Deductible and the Cap shall not apply to any indemnification obligation of
Seller pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) arising out of or resulting from any
breach of the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.1
(Organization and Existence), Section 3.2 (Authorization), Section 3.4(i)
(Noncontravention), Section 3.5(a) (Title), Section 3.19 (Brokers); provided,
however, that in all events Seller shall not be required to indemnify the
Indemnified Buyer Entities pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i), Section 7.2(a)(ii)
or Section 5.11 for Damages in excess of the Base Purchase Price.  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc045.jpg) 

44 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 (d) For the sole purpose of
determining the amount of Damages resulting from a breach of a representation
or warranty of Seller (but not for the purpose of determining the existence of
any such breach or inaccuracy) for purposes of this Article VII, any
qualification set forth therein as to "materiality", "material", "Material
Adverse Effect" or words of similar import contained in such representation or
warranty giving rise to the claim of indemnity hereunder shall in each case be
disregarded and without effect (as if such standard or qualification were
deleted from such representation or warranty). Section 7.3 Indemnification by
Buyer. (a) From and after the Closing, Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify,
defend and hold Seller and its officers, directors, employees and Affiliates
(collectively, the "Indemnified Seller Entities") harmless from and against
any and all Damages suffered, paid or incurred by such Indemnified Seller
Entities and (i) caused by, resulting from, or arising out of any breach of
any of the representations and warranties made by Buyer to Seller as of the
Closing Date as though made on and as of such date or, in the case of
representations and warranties made as of a specified date earlier than the
Closing Date, on and as of such earlier date; (ii) caused by, resulting from,
or arising out of any breach by Buyer of any of its covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement; or (iii) caused by, resulting from or arising out
of the Assumed Liabilities. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 7.3, in no event shall the Indemnified Seller
Entities be entitled to aggregate Damages pursuant to Sections 7.3(a)(i) and
7.3(a)(ii) in excess of the Base Purchase Price. Section 7.4 Indemnification
Procedures. (a) If an Indemnified Buyer Entity or an Indemnified Seller Entity
(each, an "Indemnified Entity") believes that a claim, demand or other
circumstance exists that has given or may reasonably be expected to give rise
to a right of indemnification under this Article VII (whether or not the
amount of Damages relating thereto is then quantifiable), such Indemnified
Entity shall assert its claim for indemnification by giving written notice
thereof (a "Claim Notice") to the party from which indemnification is sought
(the "Indemnifying Party") (i) if the event or occurrence giving rise to such
claim for indemnification is, or relates to, a claim, suit, action or
proceeding brought by a Person not a party to this Agreement or affiliated
with any such party (a "Third Party"), within ten Business Days following
receipt of notice of such Claim by such Indemnified Entity, or (ii) if the
event or occurrence giving rise to such action or claim for indemnification is
not, or does not relate to, a Claim brought by a Third Party, within 30 days
after the discovery by the Indemnified Entity of the circumstances giving rise
to such Claim for indemnity. Each Claim Notice shall describe the claim in
reasonable detail. The failure or delay by the Indemnified Entity to so notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any
indemnification obligation hereunder except to the extent that the defense of
such Claim is materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. (b) If any claim
or demand by an Indemnified Entity under this Article VII relates to a Claim
filed or made against an Indemnified Entity by a Third Party (a "Third Party
Claim"), the Indemnifying Party may elect at any time to negotiate a
settlement or a compromise  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc046.jpg) 

45 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 of such Claim or to defend such Third
Party Claim, in each case at its sole cost and expense and with its own
counsel, so long as (i) the Indemnifying Party provides written notice to the
Indemnified Entity that the Indemnifying Party intends to undertake such
defense, and (ii) if the Indemnifying Party is a party to the proceeding, the
Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Entity has not reasonably determined in
good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate because of a
conflict of interest. If the Indemnifying Party, after assuming the defense of
a Third Party Claim, fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend
diligently such Third Party Claim within ten (10) Business Days after
receiving written notice from the Indemnified Entity to the effect that the
Indemnifying Party has so failed, the Indemnified Entity shall have the right
but not the obligation to assume its own defense. (c) Except with the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Entity, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, no Indemnifying Party shall settle or
compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a default judgment or consent to an
entry of judgment unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) relates
solely to money damages, (ii) provides for a full, unconditional and
irrevocable release of the Indemnified Entity with respect to the claim(s)
being settled and (iii) does not contain any admission or finding of
wrongdoing on behalf of the Indemnified Entity. If, within twenty (20) days of
receipt from an Indemnified Entity of any Claim Notice with respect to a Third
Party Claim the Indemnifying Party does not elect to defend such Third Party
Claim, such Indemnified Entity may (subject to the Indemnifying Party's
continuing right of election in Section 7.4(b)), at its option, defend, settle
or otherwise compromise or pay such Third Party Claim; provided, that any such
settlement or compromise shall be permitted hereunder only with the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Unless and until the Indemnifying Party
makes an election in accordance with Section 7.4(b) to defend, settle or
compromise such Third Party Claim, all of the Indemnified Entity's reasonable
costs and expenses arising out of the defense, settlement or compromise of any
such Claim shall be Damages subject to indemnification hereunder to the extent
provided herein. Each Indemnified Entity shall make available to the
Indemnifying Party all information reasonably available to such Indemnified
Entity relating to such Claim. In addition, the Parties shall render to each
other such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order to ensure the
proper and adequate defense of any such Claim. The Party in charge of the
defense shall keep the other Party fully apprised at all times as to the
status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. If
the Indemnifying Party elects to defend any such Third Party Claim, then the
Indemnified Entity shall be entitled to participate in such defense with
separate counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, at such
Indemnified Entity's sole cost and expense. In the event the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of (or otherwise elects to negotiate or settle or
compromise) Claim as described above, the Indemnified Entity shall reimburse
the Indemnifying Party for all costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying
Party in connection with such defense (or negotiation, settlement or
compromise) to the extent, if applicable, that such costs and expenses do not
exceed the amount of the remaining Deductible. (d) This Section 7.4 shall not
apply to claims relating to Taxes, with respect to which the procedures set
forth in Section 5.11 shall govern. Section 7.5 General.  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc047.jpg) 

46 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 (a) No Indemnified Entity shall be
obligated in connection with any claim for indemnification under this Article
VII to take any action to obtain any insurance proceeds available to such
Indemnified Entity with regard to the applicable claims or to recover any
amounts to which it may be entitled in respect of the applicable claims
pursuant to contractual or other indemnification rights that the Indemnified
Entity may have against Third Parties. If an Indemnified Entity shall have
received the payment required by this Agreement from the Indemnifying Party in
respect of Damages and shall subsequently receive insurance proceeds or other
amounts in respect of such Damages, then such Indemnified Entity or its
Affiliates, as the case may be, shall promptly repay to the Indemnifying Party
a sum equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds or other amounts actually
received to the extent such amount would give rise to a double recovery by
such Indemnified Entity. (b) Subject to Section 7.5(a), each Indemnified
Entity shall be obligated in connection with any claim for indemnification
under this Article VII to use all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
Damages that would otherwise be subject to indemnification under Section 7.2,
including with respect to claims for indemnity under Section 7.2(a)(i) for
breach of the representations and warranties included in Section 3.13,
including not undertaking, nor soliciting nor importuning any Governmental
Entity or other Person to require, any environmental correction,
investigation, monitoring or remediation unless (i) affirmatively required to
do so by applicable Laws or (ii) required to do so in response to an imminent
and material threat to human health or the environment. (c) Subject to the
rights of any insurance carriers contemplated in Section 7.5(a) above, the
Indemnifying party shall be subrogated to any right of action that the
Indemnified Entity may have against any other Person with respect to any
matter giving rise to a claim for indemnified hereunder. (d) The
indemnification provided in this Article VII and Section 5.11 shall be the
exclusive post-Closing remedy available to any Party hereto with respect to
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement, or otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. (e) If
any fact, circumstance or condition forming a basis for a Claim for
indemnification under this Article VII or Section 5.11 shall overlap with any
fact, circumstance, condition, agreement or event forming the basis of any
other Claim for indemnification under this Article VII or Section 5.11, there
shall be no duplication in the calculation of the amount of the Damages. In
addition, none of Seller nor Buyer shall have any liability under this Article
VII for Damages relating to matters to the extent included in the adjustment
to the Base Purchase Price contemplated under Section 2.5(a) (other than the
failure to pay amounts (if any) that become due and payable by Seller pursuant
to Section 2.5) in accordance with the terms of Section 2.5. (f) An
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to indemnify an Indemnified Entity to
the extent of any Damages that a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator
shall have determined by final, non-appealable judgment to have resulted from
the fraud, gross negligence  

   

 ![](exhibitbuckhornassetpurc048.jpg) 

47 002346-0005-14520-Active.17967989.19 or willful misconduct of the
Indemnified Entity seeking indemnification or its officers, directors,
employees or Affiliates. (g) The Parties agree to treat all payments made by
or deemed to be made by a Party under this Article VII as adjustments to the
Purchase Price hereunder unless otherwise required by applicable law. Section

respective officers', directors', employees' or Representatives' sole, joint
or concurrent negligence, strict liability or other fault, for any matter
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and in
particular, no "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or similar
valuation methodology shall be used in calculating the amount of any losses
("Non-Reimbursable Damages"), provided that any amounts payable to third
parties pursuant to a third party claim shall not be deemed Non-Reimbursable
Damages. ARTICLE VIII TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER Section 8.1 Grounds

Closing: (a) by either Buyer or Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred
within twelve (12) months after the date of this Agreement (the "Outside

failure of the Closing to occur is the result of a material breach by Buyer of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder and

instrument shall mean a reference to such agreement, document or instrument as
the same may be amended, modified, supplemented or replaced from time to time.

or modified except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of Buyer and
Seller. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any time by
the Party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver shall be
effective, unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by or on
behalf of the Party waiving such term or condition. No waiver by any Party of
