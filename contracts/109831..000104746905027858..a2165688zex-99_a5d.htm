<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On

Stock in accordance with Section&nbsp;1.01(f), and in each case subject to proration as set forth in Section&nbsp;1.01(d). </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment or exchange, and to pay for or exchange Shares pursuant to the Offer, shall be subject only to the Minimum Condition
(as defined in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Annex A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> hereto) and to the other conditions set forth in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Annex A</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> attached hereto. Merger
Sub expressly reserves the right to increase the consideration payable pursuant to the Offer and to waive any condition of the Offer, provided that the conditions described in clauses

consideration. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject
to Sections 1.01(d), (e)&nbsp;and (f), each holder of Shares shall be entitled to elect (i)&nbsp;the number of Shares which such holder desires to exchange

Company has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement, and the consummation
by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval and the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). If required by the DGCL, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger and (iii)&nbsp;resolved to recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the Company
stockholders and that the Company stockholders tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer. Such determinations, approvals, resolutions and recommendations are in effect as of the date hereof. The
actions taken by the Company Board constitute approval of the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereby and hereby by the Company Board under the provisions of
Section&nbsp;203 of the DGCL, such that Merger Sub and Parent becoming an "interested stockholder" as a result of the Offer is approved by the Company Board for purposes of Section&nbsp;203 and
the restrictions on "business combinations" as set forth in Section&nbsp;203 of the DGCL do not apply to the Offer, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or hereby. No other

all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries under
any Transferred Employee Plan that is a welfare plan that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, to the extent that such employee would receive credit for such

indemnify the current or former directors or officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and any person who becomes an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, for acts
or omissions by such directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective Time, whether pursuant to the Company's or any Subsidiary's Certification of Incorporation, bylaws, individual indemnity
agreements or otherwise, and such obligations shall survive the Merger and the Second Merger. For a period of six years following the Effective Time, the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries shall contain, and Parent shall cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries to
contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification and exculpation of such directors and officers than are presently set forth in the Company's and its Subsidiary's Certification of

insurance "tail" or "runoff" insurance program for a period of six years after the Effective Time with respect to wrongful acts and/or omissions committed or allegedly committed at or prior to the
Effective Time (such coverage shall have an aggregate coverage limit over the term of such policy in an amount at least equal to the annual aggregate coverage limit under the Company's existing
directors and officers liability policy, and in all other respects shall be with reputable and financially sound carriers and no less advantageous on the whole to such existing coverage). Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this Section&nbsp;6.11(b) for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and effect. The Company represents to Parent that the
Maximum Premium is as set forth in Section&nbsp;6.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. </FONT></P>

is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)&nbsp;transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provisions to be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in
this Section&nbsp;6.11. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section&nbsp;6.11 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
