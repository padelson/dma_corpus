          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows (certain capitalized
but undefined terms used herein are defined in Section 9.3):

1. ARTICLE I

     Section 1.1  The Offer.  (a) Subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
                  ---------
as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than five business days after
the date of the public announcement of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence the Offer within the meaning of the
applicable rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC"). The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause
                 ---
Merger Sub to, accept for payment or pay for any Company Common Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer are subject to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A
                                                                 ---------
hereto. The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be January 3, 2001
(determined using Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2 promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")). Merger Sub expressly
reserves the right to waive any condition to the Offer or to modify the terms of
the Offer, in each case in its sole discretion; provided, however, that without
                                                --------  -------
the consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of
Company Common Shares subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the price per Company
Common Share to be paid pursuant to the Offer or change the form or time of
delivery of consideration, (iii) amend or waive the Minimum Tender Condition (as
defined in Exhibit A hereto) or add to the conditions set forth in Exhibit A
           ---------                                               ---------
hereto, (iv) except as provided below in this Section 1.1(a), extend the Offer,
or (v) otherwise amend the terms of the Offer in any manner adverse to the
holders of Company Common Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Merger Sub may,
at any time and from time to time, and, in each case, subject to Section 8.1
hereof, take one or more of the following actions without the consent of the
Company: (A) extend the Offer for one or more periods of time that Merger Sub
reasonably believes are necessary to cause the conditions to the Offer to be
satisfied, if at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the
conditions to Merger Sub's obligation to accept Company Common Shares for
payment is not satisfied or waived, until such time as all such conditions are
satisfied or waived, (B) extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof that is
applicable to the Offer or (C) extend the Offer for an aggregate period of not
more

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

than 10 business days beyond the latest applicable date that would otherwise be
permitted under clause (A) or (B) of this sentence, if, as of such date, all of
the conditions to Merger Sub's obligation to accept Company Common Shares for
payment (including the Minimum Tender Condition) are satisfied or waived, but
the number of Company Common Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer equals less than 90% of the outstanding Company Common Shares
(determined on a fully diluted basis for all outstanding stock options,
convertible securities and any other rights to acquire Company Common Stock on
the date of purchase). Without limiting the rights of Merger Sub to extend the
Offer pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, Parent and Merger Sub
agree that if (I) (x) all of the conditions to the Offer are not satisfied on
any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, (y) such conditions are reasonably
capable of being satisfied within 30 days after the initial expiration date of
the Offer and (z) the Company is in compliance with all of its covenants in this
Agreement, or (II) any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC
or the staff thereof that is applicable to the Offer requires an extension of
the Offer, then Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for one or more periods of
time that Merger Sub reasonably believes are necessary to cause the conditions
of the Offer to be satisfied, until all such conditions are satisfied or waived;
provided, however, that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer
--------  -------
pursuant to this sentence beyond the 30th day after the initial expiration date
of the Offer, unless otherwise required pursuant to (II) above. Subject to
Section 8.1 hereof, Merger Sub may, without the consent of the Company, elect to
provide a subsequent offering period for the Offer in accordance with Rule 14d-
11 under the Exchange Act, following its acceptance of Company Common Shares for
payment pursuant to the Offer. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, pay for all Company Common Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to
the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer.

          (b)  As soon as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer,
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, file with the SEC a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (such Tender
Offer Statement, together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the
"Schedule TO"), which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of
 -----------
transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents
contained therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, in each case
together with all supplements and amendments thereto, the "Offer Documents").
                                                           ---------------
Parent and Merger Sub (i) agree that, on the date on which the Schedule TO is
filed with the SEC and on each date on which any amendment or supplement to any
Offer Document is filed with the SEC, the Offer Documents shall comply as to
form in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) represent and warrant that, on the
date first published, sent or given to Shareholders, the Offer Documents will
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or
Merger Sub with respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of
the Company or any of its officers or directors specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in any Offer Document.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub
(or the Company, in the case of any information supplied by or on behalf of the
Company or any of its officers or directors specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in any Offer Document) agree promptly to correct any
information contained in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or
supplement the Offer Documents to reflect such correction and to cause the Offer
Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Shareholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Federal and state securities laws.  Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon the Offer Documents (including, without limitation, any amendment
or supplement thereto) prior to their filing with the SEC or dissemination to
the Shareholders.  Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its
counsel in writing with any written comments (and orally, with any oral
comments) that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such
comments and shall provide the Company and its counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the response of Parent and Merger Sub to any such
comments.

          (c)  The parties hereto agree to promptly file with the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts any registration statement relating to the Offer required to be
filed pursuant to Chapter 110C of the Massachusetts General Laws. Parent and
Merger Sub shall disseminate to the Shareholders the information contained in
any such registration statement relating to the Offer required to be filed
pursuant to 110C of the Massachusetts General Laws, in each case to the extent
and within the time period required by 110C of the Massachusetts General Laws.

          (d)  Prior to the expiration of the Offer, Parent shall provide or
cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to
purchase all Company Common Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer.

     Section 1.2  Company Actions.  (a) Subject to Section 5.3, the Company
                  ---------------
hereby approves of and consents to the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Recommendation (as defined in Section
3.4(b)), and the Company shall not permit the Recommendation or any component
thereof to be modified in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub or
withdrawn by the Company Board or in any other manner, except as provided in
this Agreement.

          (b)  On the date on which the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC,
the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 under the Exchange Act with respect to the Offer (such Schedule
14D-9, as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Schedule 14D-9") in
                                                          --------------
which the Company makes the recommendations referred to in Section 3.4(b),
subject to any permitted withdrawal or modification thereof in accordance with
this Agreement, and shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the Shareholders.  The
Company shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 information furnished by Parent in
writing concerning Parent's designees for directors of the Company as required
by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder, and shall use
its reasonable efforts to have the Schedule 14D-9 available for inclusion in the
initial mailing of the Offer Documents to the Shareholders.  The Company (i)
agrees that on the date on which the Schedule 14D-9 is filed with the SEC and on
each date on which any amendment or supplement to the Schedule 14D-9 is filed
with the SEC, the Schedule 14D-9 shall comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder,

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

and (ii) represents and warrants that, on the date filed with the SEC and on the
date first published, sent or given to Shareholders, the Schedule 14D-9 will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, except that no representation or warranty is made by the Company
with respect to information supplied in writing by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant
to this Agreement specifically for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company
(or Parent and Merger Sub, with respect to information supplied by Parent or
Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement specifically for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9) shall promptly correct any information contained in the Schedule 14D-9 if
and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or
supplement the Schedule 14D-9 to reflect such correction and to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Shareholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Federal securities laws. The Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub
and their counsel in writing with any written comments (and orally, with any
oral comments) that the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such
comments.

          (c)  In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable but, in any event, within two business days
after the date hereof, furnish, or cause its transfer agent to furnish, Merger
Sub promptly with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all
record holders of Company Common Shares as of a recent date and, as soon as
practicable thereafter, of those persons becoming record holders subsequent to
such date, together with copies of all lists of Shareholders, security position
listings and computer files and all other information in the Company's
possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Shares,
and shall furnish to Merger Sub such information and assistance (including
updated lists of Shareholders, security position listings and computer files) as
Merger Sub or Parent may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to
Shareholders. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, and except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in
confidence pursuant to the Confidential Disclosure Agreement dated September 27,
2000 between Parent and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement") the
information contained in any such labels, listings and files, and shall use the
information referred to in this Section 1.2(c) solely for the purpose of
communicating the Offer and disseminating any other documents necessary to
consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall promptly deliver to
the Company all copies of such information then in their possession.

     Section 1.3  Directors.  Promptly upon the satisfaction of the Minimum
                  ---------
Tender Condition and the acceptance for payment of, and payment by Merger Sub
for, any Company Common Shares pursuant to the Offer, Merger Sub shall, subject
to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder, be entitled to designate such number of directors on the Company
Board as will give Merger Sub representation on the Company Board equal to that
number of directors, rounded down to the next whole number, which is the product
of (a) the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by (b) a fraction,
                                                 ---------- --
the numerator of which is the number of Company Common Shares so accepted for
payment and paid for by Merger Sub and the denominator of which is the number of
Company Common Shares outstanding at the time of acceptance for payment of
Company Common Shares pursuant to the Offer, and the Company shall, promptly
upon such designation by Merger Sub, cause Merger Sub's designees to be elected
or appointed to the Company Board; provided, however, that during the period
                                   --------  -------
commencing with the election or appointment of Merger Sub's designees to the
Company Board until the Effective Time or earlier termination of this Agreement,
the Company Board shall have at least two directors who are directors on the
date of this Agreement and who are not officers of the Company or
representatives of any affiliates of the Company (the "Independent Directors");
                                                       ---------------------
and provided further, however, that if during such period the number of
    -------- -------  -------
Independent Directors shall be reduced below two for any reason whatsoever, the
remaining Independent Directors (or Independent Director, if there shall be only
one remaining) shall be entitled to designate persons to fill any such vacancies
who shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement
or, if no Independent Directors then remain, the other directors shall designate
two persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers, affiliates, associates
or shareholders of Parent or Merger Sub, and such persons shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. Subject to applicable law,
the Company shall take all action requested by Parent for the purpose of
effecting any such election or appointment of Merger Sub's designees. In
connection with the foregoing, the Company shall promptly, at the option of
Merger Sub, either increase the size of the Company Board or accept the
resignations (which resignations the Company will obtain on or before the date
of this Agreement, and which resignations shall only be effective as of the time
of, and shall be conditional upon, acceptance for payment of any Company Common
Shares pursuant to the Offer) of such number of its current directors as is
necessary to enable Merger Sub's designees to be elected or appointed to the
Company Board as provided above. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
cause each member of the Company Board, other than Merger Sub's designees, to
execute and deliver a letter effectuating his or her resignation as a director
of the Company Board effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.

     Section 1.4  The Merger.  (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
                  ----------
Agreement and in accordance with the MBCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
will merge with and into the Company.  At the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").
                                          ---------------------

          (b)     At the Effective Time, the Merger will have the other effects
provided in the applicable provisions of the MBCL. Without limiting the

                  -----------------------
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or any
Shareholder:

          (a)     Capital Stock of Merger Sub. All of the issued and outstanding
                  ---------------------------
shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub
                                                                      ----------
Common Stock") shall be converted into an equal number of fully paid and
------------
nonassessable shares of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Surviving
Corporation (the "Surviving Corporation Common Stock"), which will constitute
                  ----------------------------------
all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation immediately after the Effective Time.  From and after the Effective
Time, each outstanding certificate theretofore representing shares of Merger Sub
Common Stock will be deemed for all purposes to evidence ownership and to
represent the same number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock.

          (b)     Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each
                  -----------------------------------------------------
Company Common Share that is owned directly by the Company (as treasury stock),
Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, without payment of any consideration in respect thereof.

          (c)     Conversion of Company Common Shares.  (i) Subject to Sections
                  -----------------------------------
2.1(b) and 2.1(d), each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive in cash
from the Surviving Corporation the highest price per Company Common Share paid
pursuant to the Offer.

          (ii)    The cash payable upon the conversion of Company Common Shares
pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) is referred to collectively as the "Merger
Consideration."  At the Effective Time all such Company Common Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares (a "Certificate") shall cease to have
                                               -----------
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

          (d)     Dissenters' Rights.  (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this
                  ------------------
Section 2.1 to the contrary, any Company Common Shares that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a Shareholder who
has not voted such Company Common Shares in favor of this Agreement and who has
properly exercised, preserved and perfected dissenters' rights with respect to
such Company Common Shares in accordance with the MBCL, including Sections 86
through 98 thereof (the "Dissenting Provisions") and, as of the Effective Time,
has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost its right to exercise such
dissenters' rights

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

("Dissenting Shares"), will not be converted into or represent a right to
  -----------------
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c), but the holder
thereof will be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the Dissenting Provisions.

               (ii)  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.1(c), if any
holder of Company Common Shares who demands dissenters' rights with respect to
its Company Common Shares under the MBCL effectively withdraws or loses (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) its dissenters' rights, then as of the
Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs, such
Shareholder's Company Common Shares will automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.1(c), without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or
certificates formerly representing such Company Common Shares.

               (iii) The Company will give Parent (x) prompt notice of any
written intent to demand payment of the fair value of any Company Common Shares,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
MBCL received by the Company and (y) the opportunity to direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to dissenters' rights under the MBCL. The Company
may not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any exercise of dissenters'
rights and may not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, settle or
offer to settle any such dissenters' rights.

          (e)  Termination and Satisfaction of Company Options.  As of the
               -----------------------------------------------
Effective Time, each Company Option issued under either (i) the Company's 1992
Equity Incentive Plan, (ii) the Company's 1994 Directors Stock Option Plan, or
(iii) the Company's 1998 Employee and Consultant Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan
(collectively the "Stock Option Plans") and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive in cash an amount
equal to the "Net Gain" attributable to such Company Option.  At the Effective
Time all such Company Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and terminated and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Net Gain attributable thereto.  For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Net Gain" with respect to a Company Option shall mean
the product of (x) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per Company Common Share of such Company Option, and (y) the number of
Company Common Shares subject to such Company Option.  Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to the Company in a
timely manner the funds necessary to pay the aggregate amount of  "Net Gains"
attributable to all Company Options that the Company becomes obligated to pay
pursuant to this Section 2.1(e).  The Company shall make all payments of "Net
Gains" required by this Section 2.1(e) immediately prior to the Effective Time,
although it shall deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Section 2.1(e) such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payments under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the "Code") or any other applicable state, local or federal tax
law or tax laws of foreign jurisdictions.  To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Company, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Option in
respect of which such withholding was made by the Company.  The Surviving
Corporation will promptly comply with all tax laws requiring it to forward such
withheld taxes and/or pay its own taxes to the

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

responsible Governmental Entity, as well as reporting the amount of income
resulting from the payments made pursuant to this Section 2.1(e).

     Section 2.2  Exchange of Certificates.
                  ------------------------

          (a)  Paying Agent.  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
               ------------
designate, or shall cause to be designated, a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger
Consideration (the "Paying Agent") upon surrender of Certificates, and, from
                    ------------
time to time after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, to the Paying Agent funds in amounts and at
the times necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.1(c) and any payments that holders of Dissenting Shares become
entitled to under Section 2.1(d) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund"), upon surrender of Certificates, it being understood that any
and all interest or income earned on funds made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to this Agreement shall be for the benefit of, and shall be paid to,
Parent.  If for any reason the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to
which holders of Company Common Shares and Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
under this Section 2.2(a), Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or
cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit additional cash with the
Paying Agent sufficient to make all payments required under this Agreement, and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for payment
thereof.  The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose except as
expressly provided in this Agreement.

          (b)  Exchange Procedure.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the
               ------------------
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail
to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (referred to
hereinafter individually as a "Certificate" and collectively as "Certificates")
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company
Common Shares whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates held by such person shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in customary form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration.  Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled.  In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Shares that is not registered in the stock transfer books of the Company,
the proper amount of cash may be paid in exchange therefor to a person other
than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate the Merger Consideration or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.  No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate.

<PAGE>

          (c)  No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares.  The Merger
               ----------------------------------------------------
Consideration paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the
terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the Company Common Shares formerly represented by
such Certificate. At the Effective Time the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Shares
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

          (d)  No Liability. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
               ------------
none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to
any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered prior to six years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any Merger
Consideration would otherwise escheat to or became the property of any
Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.5(b)), any such Merger
Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear
of all claims or interests of any person previously entitled thereto.

          (e)  Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.  In the event that any
               --------------------------------------
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving Corporation
or Paying Agent shall pay the Merger Consideration in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the holder thereof in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation or Paying Agent, as the case may be; provided, however,
                                                           --------  -------
that the Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as the
Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect
to such Certificate.

          (f)  Termination of Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund
               ----------------------------
that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Shares for six
months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and
any holder of Company Common Shares shall look as a general creditor only to
Parent for payment of such cash to which such holder may be due subject to
applicable law.

          (g)  Withholding Rights.  Parent shall be entitled to deduct and
               ------------------
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as Parent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Company Common Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent.

           (h)  Charges and Expenses.  The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
                --------------------

-----------------------------------
Subsidiaries currently utilizes, any patented invention, trademark, trade name,
service mark, copyright, software, trade secret or know-how (collectively,
"Intellectual Property"), except for those which are owned, possessed or

lawfully used by the Company or its Subsidiaries in their business operations,
and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries infringes upon or unlawfully
uses any patented invention, trademark, trade name, service mark, copyright, or
trade secret owned or validly claimed by another Person except, in each case, as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries own, have a
valid license to use or have the right validly to use all patented inventions,
trademarks, tradenames, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets, know how and
software necessary to carry on their respective businesses except the failure of
which to own, validly license or have the right validly to use, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have or reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. All ownership rights, license rights and other rights to use any
patented invention, trademark, trade name, service mark, copyright, software

public through dealers in commercial software or directly from the manufacturer
which have been licensed to the Company), trade secret or know-how necessary to

transferable would not have or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries are aware of any third party
infringement or misappropriation of any patent, trademark, trade name, service
mark, copyright, software, trade secret or know-how owned by the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

Section 3.17  Insurance.  Except to the extent adequately accrued on the most
-----------------------
recent balance sheet contained in the SEC Reports filed as of this date, neither
the Company nor its Subsidiaries has any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to
pay in connection with any insurance policies any retroactive premiums or
"retro-premiums" that, individually or in the aggregate, would have or
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have obtained and maintained in full force and effect insurance
with insurance companies or associations in such amounts, on such terms and
covering such risks, as is customarily carried by reasonably prudent persons
conducting businesses or owning or leasing assets similar to those conducted,
owned or leased by the Company, except where the failure to obtain or maintain
such insurance, individually or in the aggregate, would not have or be
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

---------------------------------------
Letter is a complete and accurate list of all of the following contracts
(written or oral), plans, undertakings, commitments or agreements ("Company
                                                                    -------
Contracts") to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
---------
which any of them is bound as of the date of this Agreement:

          (a)  each distribution, supply, inventory purchase, franchise,
license, joint development, sales, agency or advertising contract involving
annual expenditures or liabilities in excess of $200,000 which is not cancelable
(without material penalty, cost or other liability) within one year;

          (b)  each promissory note, loan, agreement, indenture, evidence of
indebtedness or other instrument providing for the lending of money, whether as
borrower, lender or guarantor, in excess of $100,000;

          (c)  each contract, lease, agreement, instrument or other arrangement
containing any covenant limiting the freedom of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to engage in the business of the Company or compete with any
person;

          (d)  each joint venture or partnership agreement that is material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; and

          (e)  any contract that would constitute a "material contract" (as such
term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC).

          True and complete copies of the written Company Contracts, as amended
to date, that would be required to be filed as exhibits to the Company's Form
10-K if such Form 10-K were being filed on this date, that have not been filed
prior to the date hereof as exhibits to the SEC Reports have been delivered or
made available to Parent.

          Each Company Contract is valid and binding on the Company, and any
Subsidiary of the Company which is a party thereto and, to the knowledge of the
Company, each

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

other party thereto and is in full force and effect, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries have performed and complied with all obligations required to be
performed or complied with by them under each Company Contract, except in each
case as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.19  Title to Assets.  The Company and its Subsidiaries have good and
-----------------------------
marketable title to all of their real and personal properties and assets
reflected in the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of
September 30, 2000 (the "Latest Balance Sheet") (other than assets disposed of
                         --------------------
since September 30, 2000 in the ordinary course of business, and properties and
assets acquired since September 30, 2000), in each case free and clear of all
Encumbrances except for (i) Encumbrances which secure indebtedness reflected in
the SEC Reports; (ii) liens for Taxes accrued but not yet due; (iii) liens
arising as a matter of law in the ordinary course of business with respect to
obligations incurred after the date of the Latest Balance Sheet, provided that
the obligations secured by such liens are not delinquent; and (iv) such
imperfections of title and Encumbrances, if any, as would not have or reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries
own, or have valid leasehold interests in, all properties and assets used in the
conduct of their business. Any real property and other assets held under lease
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are held under valid, subsisting and
enforceable leases with such exceptions which, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to interfere with the use made or proposed to
be made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of such property.

Section 3.20  State Takeover Statutes.  The Board of Directors of the Company
-------------------------------------
has approved the Offer, the Merger and this Agreement and, assuming the accuracy
of Parent's and Merger Sub's representation in Section 4.4, such approval is
necessary to render inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the provisions of Chapters 110D
and 110F of the Massachusetts General Laws to the extent, if any, such chapters
are applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No other
"fair price," "merger moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other anti-
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation (other than Chapter 110C of
the Massachusetts General Laws) applies or purports to apply to the Merger, this
Agreement, the Offer or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 3.21  Rights Agreement. To the best of the Company's knowledge, no
------------------------------
"Distribution Date" or "Triggering Event" (as such terms are defined in the
Rights Agreement) has occurred as of this date. This Agreement and the Option
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder and
thereunder, including the Offer and the Merger, have been approved by at least
two-thirds (2/3) of the Continuing Directors (as defined in the Rights
Agreement). The Rights Agreement has been amended so that the execution or
delivery of this Agreement, the acquisition or deemed beneficial ownership of
any Company Common Shares by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to the Shareholders
Agreement or the Option Agreement, or the exchange of the Company Common Shares
for cash in accordance with Article II will not cause (A) the Rights issued
pursuant to the Rights Agreement to become exercisable under the Rights
Agreement, (B) Parent or Merger Sub to be deemed an "Acquiring Person" (as
defined in the Rights Agreement), or (C) a "Stock Acquisition Date" or a
"Triggering Event" (each as defined in the Rights Agreement) to occur upon any
such event. The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Option Agreement
and the Shareholders Agreement and the consummation of

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not result in the ability
of any Person to exercise any Rights or cause the Rights to separate from the
Company Common Shares to which they are attached or to be triggered or become
exercisable.

Section 3.22  Product Warranty.  Each product manufactured, sold, leased, or
------------------------------
delivered by any of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been in substantial
conformity with all applicable contractual commitments and all express and
implied warranties, and none of the Company and its Subsidiaries has any
liability (and there is no basis for any present or future action, suit,
proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand against
any of them giving rise to any liability) for replacement or repair thereof or
other damages in connection therewith other than liabilities that would not have
or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, subject only to the
reserve for product warranty claims as adjusted for the passage of time through
the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. No product manufactured, sold, leased, or delivered by any
of the Company and its Subsidiaries is subject to any guaranty, warranty, or
other indemnity beyond the applicable standard terms and conditions of sale or
lease. The Company has provided the Parent on or prior to the date hereof copies
of the standard terms and conditions of sale or lease of products for each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (containing applicable guaranty, warranty, and
indemnity provisions).

Section 3.23  Product Liability.  None of the Company and its Subsidiaries has
-------------------------------
any liability (and there is no basis for any present or future action, suit,
proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand against
any of them giving rise to any liability) arising out of any injury to
individuals or property as a result of the ownership, possession, or use of any
product manufactured, sold, leased, or delivered by any of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, other than liabilities that would not have or reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

     Section 3.24  Opinion Of Financial Advisor.
                   ----------------------------

          The Company has received the written opinion of Broadview
International LLC, substantially to the effect that, as of the date hereof, the

copy of such opinion has been delivered to Parent.

date of this Agreement as follows:

Section 4.1  Existence; Corporate Authority.  Parent and Merger Sub are
-------------------------------------------
corporations duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of their jurisdiction of incorporation and have all requisite corporate
power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and carry on its
business as now conducted, except where the failure to have such power and
authority, individually or in the aggregate, would not delay the consummation of
the Offer or the

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

Merger or materially adversely affect their ability to consummate the Offer or

this Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub, the performance by each of them
of their respective obligations hereunder and the consummation by each of Parent
and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on their respective parts. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
each of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against each of them in accordance

the bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) subject to obtaining or making the
notices, reports, filings, waivers, consents, approvals or authorizations
referred to in paragraph (b) below, conflict with or violate any law,
regulation, court order, judgment or decree applicable to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) or by which any of their respective property
is bound or affected, other than the filings required under the Exchange Act and
the Securities Act, except, in the case of clause (ii) above, as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on their ability to consummate the Offer or the Merger.

notification requirements of the HSR Act, the filing of articles of merger with
respect to the Merger as required by the MBCL, filings with the SEC under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, any filings required pursuant to any state

nor any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) is required to submit any
notice, report or other filing with any Governmental Entity in connection with
the execution, delivery, performance or consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, except where
the failure to submit such notice, report or other filing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, delay the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger or have or reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
Parent's or Merger Sub's ability to consummate the Merger or otherwise prevent
Parent or Merger Sub from performing its obligations under this Agreement.
Except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, no waiver, consent,
approval or authorization of any governmental or regulatory authority, court,
agency, commission or other governmental entity or any securities exchange or
other self-regulatory body, domestic or foreign Governmental Entity is required
to be obtained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) in

<PAGE>

connection with its execution, delivery, performance or consummation of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby except for such waivers,
consents, approvals or authorizations that, if not obtained or made, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, delay the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger or have or be expected to have a material adverse effect on Parent's or
Merger Sub's ability to consummate the Offer or the Merger or otherwise prevent
Parent or Merger Sub from performing their obligations under this Agreement.

Section 4.4  Interested Shareholder.  As of the date hereof (excluding any
-----------------------------------
beneficial ownership that may be attributed to Parent or Merger Sub by virtue of
any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or by the execution of this
Agreement), (i) neither Parent, Merger Sub nor any of their affiliates is, with
respect to the Company, an "Interested Shareholder", as such term is defined in

reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2000 and June 30, 2000
(collectively, the "Parent Public Reports"). The consolidated financial

statements of Parent contained in the Parent Public Reports present fairly the
financial position of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries at the respective
dates of the balance sheet and the results of operations for the periods then
ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis. The Parent Public Reports do not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

will be confirmed in writing dated the date of this Agreement), substantially to
the effect that, as of such date, the consideration to be paid in the Offer and
the Merger to the Shareholders is fair to Parent from a financial point of view.

materially delay consummation of the Offer of the Merger or otherwise prevent or
materially delay Parent or Merger Sub from performing their respective
obligations under this Agreement or have or reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate
the Offer or the Merger; provided, however that a material adverse effect with
                         --------  -------
respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub), taken as a whole,
will not be deemed to have occurred if the change, circumstance, event, effect

lead to an Acquisition Proposal from any Person, engage in any discussion or
negotiations relating thereto or accept any Acquisition Proposal or enter into
any contract or understanding requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided that, at any time prior to the acceptance for payment of
Company Common Shares pursuant to the Offer, the Company may, subject to
compliance with this Section 5.3(b), furnish information to, and negotiate or
otherwise engage in discussions with, any Person (a "Proposing Party") who (x)
                                                     ---------------
delivers a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal which was not solicited,
initiated, encouraged or facilitated by the Company, directly or indirectly,
after the date of this Agreement or otherwise resulted from a breach of this
Section 5.3, and (y) enters into an appropriate confidentiality agreement with
the Company (which agreement shall be no less favorable to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement and a copy of which will be delivered to Parent
promptly after the execution thereof), if, but only if, the Board of Directors
determines in good faith by a majority vote, (i) after consultation with, and
receipt of advice from, its outside legal counsel, and taking into account,
among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal and the party making the proposal, that such proposal would, if
consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to its shareholders
(in their capacities as shareholders), from a financial point of view, than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) after consultation with
the Company's independent financial advisors, that such proposal could
reasonably be expected to be completed (a "Superior Transaction").

          (c) The Company shall notify Parent orally and in writing (1) of any
such offers or proposals (including, without limitation, the terms and
conditions of any such offers or proposals), and any amendments or revisions
thereto, (2) whether the Person making such offer or proposal has a class of
equity securities that is publicly traded, and whether such Person is a Fortune
500 company, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange or is traded on The Nasdaq
National Market, and (3) without requiring the Company to divulge information
that reasonably could lead Parent to identify the Person making such offer or
proposal, such other information regarding the financial position of the Person
making such offer or proposal and such other information as Parent reasonably
may request relating to such Person's ability to finance and consummate the
Acquisition Transaction so offered or proposed.  The foregoing information shall
be delivered to Parent as promptly as practicable following the receipt by the
Company of such offer or proposal, and the Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status and material terms of any such offer or proposal.  For
purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean, with respect to
                             --------------------
the Company, any proposal or offer from any Person (other

                                      -31-
<PAGE>

than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) relating to any (i) direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of a portion of the business of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that generates 20% or more of the consolidated net revenues or
constitutes 20% or more of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii)
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business generates
20% or more of the consolidated net revenues or constitutes 20% or more of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (iii) tender offer or exchange offer
that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more
of the capital stock of the Company, or (iv) merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business generates 20% or
more of the consolidated net revenues or constitutes 20% or more of the assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Each of the transactions referred to in
clauses (i) - (iv) of the definition of Acquisition Proposal, other than any
such transaction to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, shall be
deemed to exclude the Company's Subsidiary in Australia and is referred to as an
"Acquisition Transaction". For purposes of this Section 5.1(c), "consolidated
 -----------------------
net revenues" shall refer to the aggregate revenues of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the 12-month period ending on the last day of the period
covered by the most recent Form 10-K report of the Company or, if later, the
most recent Form 10-Q report of the Company filed with the SEC.

          (d) If, prior to the acceptance for payment of Company Common Shares
pursuant to the Offer, the Board of Directors determines in good faith by a
majority vote, with respect to any Acquisition Proposal from a Proposing Party
for an Acquisition Transaction received after the date hereof that was not
solicited, initiated, encouraged or facilitated by the Company, directly or
indirectly, as required by, and in accordance with, Section 5.3(b) above, after
the date of this Agreement or did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section 5.3, that, based upon consultations with the Company's independent
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, the Acquisition Transaction is a
Superior Transaction, then the Company may terminate this Agreement and enter
into an acquisition agreement for the Superior Transaction; provided that, prior
to any such termination, and in order for such termination to be effective, (i)
the Company shall provide Parent three business day's written notice that it
intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.3(d), identifying
the Superior Transaction and delivering an accurate description of all material
terms of the Superior Transaction to be entered into, and (ii) on the date of
termination (provided that the advice of the Company's independent financial
advisors and outside legal counsel referred to above shall continue in effect
without revocation, revision or modification), the Company shall deliver to
Parent (A) a written notice of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 5.3(d), (B) wire transfer of immediately available funds in the amount
of the Termination Fee, (C) a written acknowledgment from the Company that the
termination of this Agreement and the entry into the Superior Transaction are a
Triggering Event, and (D) a written acknowledgment from each other party to the
Superior Transaction that it has read the Company's acknowledgment referred to
in clause (C) above and will not contest the matters thus acknowledged by the
Company, including the payment of the Termination Fee.

          (e) Nothing in this Section 5.3 shall prevent the Board of Directors
from taking, and disclosing to the Shareholders, a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any
disclosure required under the MBCL (subject, however, to compliance with the
balance of this sentence where applicable), and the

                                      -32-
<PAGE>

Board of Directors may prior to the acceptance for payment of Company Common
Shares pursuant to the Offer, withdraw, modify or change its Recommendation if,
in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its obligations under applicable law; provided that in the case of a tender
offer made by any Person other than Parent or Merger Sub, the Board of Directors
shall not recommend that shareholders tender their Company Common Shares in such
tender offer unless (i) such tender offer is determined to be a Superior
Transaction in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3(d) and (ii) the
Company has provided Parent with not less than three business day's prior
written notice of any such action; provided, further, that in no event shall the
Company or its Board of Directors take, agree, or resolve to take any action
prohibited by Section 5.3(b) or 5.3(d) except as expressly permitted by such
Sections.

          (f) Except pursuant to the exercise of its rights in compliance with
this Section 5.3, the Company shall not take any action to make the provisions
of Chapter 110D or Chapter 110F of the MBCL inapplicable to any Acquisition
Transaction in respect of the Company or release any standstill agreements or
other similar restrictions, or amend the Rights Agreement, redeem the Rights or
take any other action which would result in the Rights Agreement becoming
inapplicable to any Person or any Acquisition Transaction prior to the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

          (b) If the approval of this Agreement by the Shareholders is required
by law, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable following the expiration
of the Offer (provided that the Minimum Tender Condition shall have been
satisfied), establish a record date (which

                                      -33-

will be as promptly as reasonably practicable following the expiration of the
Offer) for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the

not be affected by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company or any other person of any Acquisition Proposal or
(ii) the withdrawal or modification by the Board of Directors of its approval or
recommendation of the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement.

          (c)    The Company represents and warrants that the information (other
than information with respect to Parent and Merger Sub which is supplied by
Parent and Merger Sub in writing to the Company specifically for use in the
Proxy Statement) contained in the Proxy Statement will not, at the date of
mailing to the Shareholders or at the date of such Shareholders Meeting, contain
any statement which, at the time and in light of the circumstances under which
it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for such Shareholders
Meeting. The Company represents and warrants that the Proxy Statement will
comply as to form in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder. Parent and Merger Sub represent and
warrant that the information supplied by Parent and Merger Sub in writing to the
Company specifically for use in the Proxy Statement will not, at the date of

it is made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Shareholders
Meeting.

          (d)  Notwithstanding Section 6.1(a), (b) or (c), in the event that
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent acquires, directly or
indirectly, at least 90% of the outstanding Company Common Shares pursuant to
the Offer or otherwise, the parties hereto will take all necessary and
appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective in accordance with

subject to their respective legal obligations, the Company, Parent and Merger

          (a) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event whose occurrence or
nonoccurrence is reasonably expected to cause any of the conditions precedent
set forth in Article VII not to be satisfied; and

          (b) any facts relating to that party which would make it necessary or
advisable to amend the Schedule TO or the Proxy Statement in order to make the
statements therein not untrue or misleading or to comply with applicable law;
provided, however, that the delivery of

                                      -35-
<PAGE>

Company will promptly supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Letter with
respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing or occurring at or
prior to the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in the Company Disclosure Letter which is necessary to correct any
information in the Company Disclosure Letter or in any representation and
warranty of the Company that has been rendered inaccurate thereby.  For purposes
of determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
contained in Article III in order to determine the fulfillment of the conditions

and inspections thereof as Parent may reasonably request and (iii) furnish
Parent with such financial and operating data and other information with respect

information furnished pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall affect any
representation or warranty made herein by the Company or the conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Parent will endeavor to describe information requests with as
much specificity as is practicable. Each of Parent and the Company shall
designate a representative to coordinate information and other requests pursuant

the Effective Time, the Company's current directors and officers insurance
policies, if such insurance is obtainable (or policies of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions no less advantageous to the current and
all former directors and officers of the Company) with respect to acts or
failures to act prior to the Effective Time, including acts relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that in order to
maintain or procure such coverage, Parent shall not be required to maintain or
obtain policies providing such coverage except to the extent such coverage can
be provided at an annual cost of no greater than two times the most recent
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof (the "Cap"); and
                                                                  ---
provided, further, that if equivalent coverage cannot be obtained, or can be
obtained only by paying an annual premium in excess of the Cap, Parent shall
only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying an
annual premium equal to the Cap.

<PAGE>

          (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each Person who
is, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(each, an "Indemnified Party") against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
           -----------------
costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions,
or alleged acts or omissions, by them in their capacities as such, which acts or
omissions occurred prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time.  In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (an "Action"), the Parent shall
                                               ------
control the defense of such Action with counsel selected by the Parent, which
counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party shall be permitted to participate in the
defense of such Action through counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, which
counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Parent, at the Indemnified Party's
expense.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is any conflict between the
Parent and any Indemnified Parties or there are additional defenses available to
any Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties shall be permitted to
participate in the defense of such Action with counsel selected by the
Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Parent,
and Parent shall cause Parent to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel, as accrued and in advance of the final disposition of such Action to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that the
Parent shall not be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of more
than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any single Action except to the
extent that, in the opinion of counsel for the Indemnified Parties, two or more
of such Indemnified Parties have conflicting interests in the outcome of such
Action.  The Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
written consent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld.

          (c) The Surviving Corporation shall keep in effect all provisions in
its articles of organization and by-laws that provide for exculpation of
director and officer liability and indemnification (and advancement of expenses
related thereto) of the past and present officers and directors of the Company
to the fullest extent permitted by the MBCL and such provisions shall not be
amended except as either required by applicable law or to make changes permitted
by law that would enhance the rights of past or present officers and directors
to indemnification or advancement of expenses.

          (d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors
or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or
other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of the consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.

          (e) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their
heirs and their representatives.

breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement

reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Parent's or Merger

Offer and the Merger, which breach or failure to perform has not been or is
incapable of being cured by Parent within 20 business days after its receipt of
written notice thereof from the Company;

of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article VIII, this Agreement
shall become void (other than this Section 8.2) with no liability on the part of
either party (or of any of its representatives);

          (b)  Upon the happening of a Triggering Event, the Company shall pay

                                        ---------------      ----------------
means any one of the following:

               (i)   a termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to
     Section 8.1(g)(i) or (ii);

               (ii)  a termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to
     Section 8.1(d)(i) or 8.1(f) if any Acquisition Proposal is publicly
     proposed or announced on or after the date hereof and such Acquisition
     Proposal has not been publicly rejected by the Board of Directors; or

               (iii) a termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
     Section 8.1(h); or

               (iv)  if, within twelve months after a termination of this
Agreement, any Acquisition Transaction is entered into, agreed to or consummated
by the Company with a Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub) who made, or who
is affiliated with any Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub) who made, (A) an
Acquisition Proposal or (B) a statement of intent to pursue an Acquisition
Transaction, either of which was publicly proposed or announced prior to a
termination of this Agreement.

Payment of the Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds (1) on the second business day after such termination in the
case of clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of Triggering Event, (2) on or

definition of Triggering Event.  In no event shall more than one Termination Fee
be payable by each party under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, upon receipt of the Termination Fee
by Parent (or its designee), Parent and Merger Sub shall have no other or
further claim or demand of any kind or nature whatsoever against the Company or
any of its affiliates except for any claims or rights Parent may have under the
Shareholders Agreement or the Option Agreement.

          (c) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(e), Parent shall pay to the Company as liquidated damages the sum of
$9,000,000; and, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, upon receipt of such sum the Company shall have no other or further
claim or demand of any kind or nature whatsoever against Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their affiliates.

          (d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither party would enter into
this Agreement.  Accordingly, if either party fails to pay promptly amounts when
due pursuant to this Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, the
other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against the non-paying
party for such amount (or any portion thereof), the non-paying party shall pay
the costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) of the other party
in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount in respect
of the period from the date such amount became due until paid at the prime rate
of The Chase Manhattan Bank in effect from time to time during such period.

     Section 8.3  Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
     ----------------------
hereto at any time, whether before or after the Shareholder Approval has been
obtained; provided that, after the purchase of Company Common Shares pursuant to
the Offer, no amendment shall be made which decreases the Merger Consideration
and, after the Shareholder Approval, if required, has been obtained, there shall
be made no amendment that by law requires further approval by the Shareholders
of the parties without the further approval of such Shareholders. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each
of the parties hereto. Following the election or appointment of Merger Sub's
designees pursuant to Section 1.3 and prior to the Effective Time, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Independent Directors then in office shall
be required by the Company to (i) amend or terminate this Agreement by the
Company, (ii) exercise or waive any of the Company's rights or remedies under
this Agreement or (iii) extend the time for performance of Parent and Merger
Sub's respective obligations under this Agreement.

and in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect;

obligation required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to
the Termination Date, which failure would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect;

qualifications and orders, the failure of which to obtain, individually and in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect; provided, however, that the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications or orders is not the result of a breach by Parent
or Merger Sub of any of their covenants and other obligations set forth in this
Agreement;

          (g)  this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its

regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such condition, makes it
inadvisable to proceed with such acceptance for payment or payment.

     The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Merger Sub and Parent
and may be asserted by Merger Sub or Parent regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to such condition or may be waived by Merger Sub and Parent in whole
or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion.  The
failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any other affiliate of Parent at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right; the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

          The terms in this Exhibit A that are defined in the attached Merger
                            ---------
