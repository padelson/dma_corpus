<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries
are members of the same affiliated group within the meaning of Code Section&nbsp;1504(a). Beacon Federal, on behalf of itself and
its Subsidiaries, has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, those filed on a consolidated,
combined or unitary basis) required to have been filed by Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries prior to the date
hereof, or requests for extensions to file such returns and reports have been timely filed. All such Tax Returns are true, correct,
and complete in all material respects. Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries have timely paid or, prior to the Effective
Time will pay, all Taxes, whether or not shown on such returns or reports, due or claimed to be due to any Governmental Entity
prior to the Effective Time other than Taxes which are being contested in good faith. Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries
have declared on their Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial underpayment of United States
Federal Income Tax within the meaning of Section&nbsp;6662 of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state or local laws).
The accrued but unpaid Taxes of Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries did not, as of the most recent Beacon Federal
Financial Statements, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the most recent Beacon Federal balance sheet (rather than in
any notes thereto). Beacon Federal and its Subsidiaries are subject to Tax audits in the ordinary course of business. Beacon Federal
management does not believe that an adverse resolution to any of such audits of which it has Knowledge would be reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Beacon Federal. Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries have not been notified
in writing by any jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that Beacon Federal or any of the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries were
required to file any Tax Return in such jurisdiction that was not filed. Neither Beacon Federal nor any of the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries
(A) has been a member of a group with which they have filed or been included in a combined, consolidated or unitary income Tax
Return other than a group the common parent of which was Beacon Federal or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other
than Beacon Federal or any of the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries) under Treas. Reg. &sect;&nbsp;1.1502-6 (or any similar provision
of state, local, or non-U.S. law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise. As of the date hereof, all deficiencies
proposed in writing as a result of any audits have been paid or settled. There are no written claims or assessments pending against
Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary for any alleged deficiency in any Tax, and neither Beacon Federal nor any Beacon
Federal Subsidiary has been notified in writing of any proposed Tax claims or assessments against Beacon Federal or any Beacon
Federal Subsidiary. Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries each have duly and timely withheld, collected and paid over
to the appropriate taxing authority all amounts required to be so withheld and paid under all applicable laws, and have duly and
timely filed all Tax Returns with respect to such withheld Taxes, within the time prescribed under any applicable law. Beacon Federal
and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries have delivered to BHLB true and complete copies of all Tax Returns of Beacon Federal and the
Beacon Federal Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending on or after December 31, 2005. Neither Beacon Federal nor any of the Beacon
Federal Subsidiaries is or has been a party to any &ldquo;reportable transaction,&rdquo; as defined in Code &sect;&nbsp;6707A(c)(1)
and Treas. Reg. &sect;&nbsp;1.6011-4(b). Neither Beacon Federal nor any of the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries has distributed stock
of another Person, or has had its stock distributed by another Person, in a transaction that was purported or intended to be governed
in whole or in part by Code &sect;&nbsp;355 or Code &sect;&nbsp;361. Neither Beacon Federal nor any of the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries
has been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Code &sect;&nbsp;897(c)(2) during the applicable
period specified in Code &sect;&nbsp;897(c)(1)(A)(ii).</P>

so employed immediately following the Effective Time (the &ldquo;<B>Continuing Beacon Federal Employees</B>&rdquo;), compensation,
employee benefits and terms and conditions of employment that are substantially similar to those provided by BHLB to similarly

(ii)&nbsp;be construed to limit the ability of BHLB to review employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements from time to time,

programs and arrangements provided that no such action shall discriminate against Continuing Beacon Federal Employees relative
to similarly situated employees of BHLB, (iii)&nbsp; create third party rights against BHLB. BHLB will use best efforts to cause
its insurance providers to waive all pre-existing condition limitations and proof of insurability provisions (to the extent such
limitations and provisions did not apply to a pre-existing condition under Beacon Federal&rsquo;s equivalent plan) and eligibility
waiting periods under such plans that would otherwise be applicable to newly-hired employees for all Continuing Beacon Federal
Employees; provided that nothing in this sentence shall limit the ability of BHLB to amend or enter into new or different employee
benefit plans or arrangements provided such plans or arrangements treat the Continuing Beacon Federal Employees in a substantially
similar manner as employees of BHLB are treated. In the event BHLB is unable to eliminate the eligibility waiting period for health
care coverage for Continuing Beacon Federal Employees, BHLB shall provide such employees with health care continuation coverage
under COBRA at its own expense during any waiting period. BHLB will cause its insurance providers to honor under such plans any
deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Continuing Beacon Federal Employees and their covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year prior to the relevant Benefit Plan Determination Date. Under all BHLB Benefit Plans, service
with Beacon Federal or a Beacon Federal Subsidiary shall be deemed to be service with BHLB for eligibility and vesting purposes
only, but not for purposes of benefit accrual.</P>
