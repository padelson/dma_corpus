The closing ("Closing") shall occur no later than the close of business on
the fifth Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by applicable law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article IX
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by
applicable law) waiver of those conditions), or such other date that may be
agreed to in writing by the parties. The Merger shall be effected by the
filing of a certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in accordance with the DGCL, and articles of merger with the
Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation, in accordance with the
MGCL, on the day of the Closing (the "Closing Date"). The Merger shall be
effective on the date and time specified in the certificate of merger filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the articles of
merger filed with the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation
(the "Effective Time"). A pre-closing of the transactions contemplated hereby
(the "Pre-Closing") shall take place at the offices of Luse Gorman Pomerenk and

2.3 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.

  



  

The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of BHLB as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided
therein and by applicable law.

  



  

2.4 Directors of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

BHLB shall take all appropriate action so that, as of the Effective Time, the
number of directors constituting the Boards of Directors of BHLB and Berkshire
Bank shall be increased by one and that, effective immediately after the
Closing Date, one director of Beacon Federal (as of the date hereof and as of
the Effective Time), as designated by BHLB and Berkshire Bank, shall be
appointed to the Boards of Directors of BHLB and Berkshire Bank. All other
directors and officers of BHLB immediately prior to the Effective Time shall

2.6 Tax Consequences.

  



  

It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement shall constitute
a "plan of reorganization" as that term is used in Sections 354 and 361 of
the Code.

  



  

2.7 Possible Alternative Structures.

  



  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX, prior
to the Effective Time BHLB may revise the structure for effecting the Merger
described in Section 2.1 or the Bank Merger including, without limitation, by
substituting a wholly owned subsidiary for BHLB or Berkshire Bank, as
applicable, provided that (i) any such subsidiary shall become a party to,
and shall agree to be bound by, the terms of this Agreement; (ii) such
modification shall not adversely affect the Federal income tax consequences
of the Merger to BHLB, Berkshire Bank, Beacon Federal, Beacon Bank or to the
holders of Beacon Federal Common Stock or prevent the rendering of the
opinions contemplated in Sections 9.2.5 and 9.3.5; (iii) the consideration to
be paid to the holders of Beacon Federal Common Stock under this Agreement is
not thereby changed in kind or value or reduced in amount; and (iv) such
modification will not delay materially or jeopardize receipt of any
Regulatory Approvals or other consents and approvals relating to the
consummation of the Merger or otherwise materially impede or delay
consummation of the Merger or cause any condition to Closing set forth in
Article IX not to be capable of being fulfilled. The parties hereto agree to
appropriately amend this Agreement and any related documents in order to
reflect any such revised structure.

  



  

2.8 Additional Actions.

  



  

If, at any time after the Effective Time, BHLB shall consider or be advised
that any further deeds, documents, assignments or assurances in law or any
other acts are necessary or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of
record or otherwise, in BHLB its right, title or interest in, to or under any
of the rights, properties or assets of Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal
Subsidiary, or (ii) otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
Beacon Federal and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted
to BHLB an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver, in such
official corporate capacities, all such deeds, assignments or assurances in
law or any other acts as are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect or
confirm, of record or otherwise, in BHLB its right, title or interest in, to
or under any of the rights, properties or assets of Beacon Federal or (b)
otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and the officers and
directors of the BHLB are authorized in the name of Beacon Federal or
otherwise to take any and all such action.

  



  

2.9 Advisory Board.

  



  

Effective immediately after the Effective Time, the board members of Beacon
Federal as of the Effective Time who do not join the boards of BHLB or
Berkshire Bank shall be appointed to a currently existing Advisory Board of
Berkshire Bank (the "Advisory Board"). The Advisory Board shall meet as
requested by the Board of Directors of Berkshire Bank and the initial term
shall be for one year. Each member of the Advisory Board shall receive
compensation as set by the Board of Directors of Berkshire Bank from time to
time. Berkshire Bank shall consider, at its reasonable discretion, the
composition, compensation and need for the Advisory Board after the
completion of the one year term.

  



  

ARTICLE III

  

CONVERSION OF SHARES

  



  

3.1 Conversion of Beacon Federal Common Stock; Merger
Consideration.

  



  

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of BHLB, Beacon Federal or the holders of any of the shares of Beacon
Federal Common Stock, the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the
following terms:

  



   

9 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

3.1.1 Each share of BHLB Common Stock that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the
Merger.

  



  

3.1.2 All shares of Beacon Federal Common Stock held in the
treasury of Beacon Federal and each share of Beacon Federal Common Stock
owned by BHLB prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held in a
fiduciary capacity or in connection with debts previously
contracted) ("Treasury Stock") and each share of Beacon Federal Common Stock
held in a trust under the Beacon Federal Bancorp, Inc. 2008 Equity Incentive
Plan shall, at the Effective Time, cease to exist, and such shares, including
any Certificates therefor, shall be canceled as promptly as practicable
thereafter, and no payment or distribution shall be made in consideration
therefor.

  



  

3.1.3 Each outstanding share of Beacon Federal Common Stock with
respect to which an election to receive BHLB Common Stock has been
effectively made and not revoked or lost, pursuant to Section 3.2.3 (a "Stock
Election"), shall be converted into the right to receive (i) 0.9200 (the
"Exchange Ratio") of a share of BHLB Common Stock, subject to adjustment as
provided in Sections 10.1.9 and 3.1.10 and to the provisions of Section 3.2
(the "Stock Consideration") (collectively, the "Stock Election Shares").

  



  

3.1.4 Subject to the provisions of Section 3.2, each outstanding
share of Beacon Federal Common Stock with respect to which an election to
receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked or lost, pursuant to
Section 3.2.3 (a "Cash Election"), shall be converted into the right to
receive a cash payment, without interest, equal to $20.50 (the "Cash
Consideration") (collectively, the "Cash Election Shares").

  



  

3.1.5 Each outstanding share of Beacon Federal Common Stock other
than as to which a Cash Election or a Stock Election has been
effectively made and not revoked or lost, pursuant to Section 3.2.3
(collectively, "Non-Election Shares"), shall be converted into the right to
receive such Stock Consideration and/or Cash Consideration as shall be
determined in accordance with Section 3.2.

  



  

3.1.6 Except as set forth in Section 3.1.2 or 3.1.7, upon the
Effective Time, outstanding shares of Beacon Federal Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and shall thereafter by operation of this Section 3.1 represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto or any dividends or distributions with a
record date prior to the Effective Time that were declared or made by Beacon
Federal on such shares of Beacon Federal Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time.

  



  

3.1.7 Each outstanding share of Beacon Federal Common Stock, the
holder of which has perfected his right to dissent under applicable law
and has not effectively withdrawn or lost such right as of the Effective Time
(the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right
to receive the Merger Consideration hereunder, and the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by applicable law. Beacon Federal
shall give BHLB immediate notice upon receipt by Beacon Federal of any such
demands for payment of the fair value of such shares of Beacon Federal Common
Stock and of withdrawals of such notice and any other related communications
(any shareholder duly making such demand being hereinafter called a
"Dissenting Shareholder"), and BHLB shall have the right to participate in
all discussions, negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. Beacon Federal shall not, except with the prior written consent of
BHLB, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demand for payment, or waive any failure to timely deliver a
written demand for appraisal or the taking of any other action by such
Dissenting Shareholder as may be necessary to perfect appraisal rights under
applicable law. Any payments made in respect of Dissenting Shares shall be
made by the Surviving Institution.

  



  

3.1.8 If any Dissenting Shareholder withdraws or loses (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment at or prior to the
Effective Time, such holder's shares of Beacon Federal Common Stock shall be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
the applicable provisions of this Agreement. If such holder withdraws or loses
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to such payment after the
Effective Time, each share of Beacon Federal Common Stock of such holder
shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration.

3.1.9 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of BHLB Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend
or distribution with respect to BHLB Common Stock shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share interests, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of BHLB. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
BHLB shall pay to each former holder of Beacon Federal Common Stock who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of BHLB
Common Stock, an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without
interest, equal to the product of (i) the fraction of a share to which such
holder would otherwise have been entitled and (ii) the average of the daily
closing sales prices of a share of BHLB Common Stock as reported on the
NASDAQ Global Select Market for the five (5) consecutive trading days
immediately preceding the Closing Date. For purposes of determining any
fractional share interest, all shares of Beacon Federal Common Stock owned by
a Beacon Federal shareholder shall be combined so as to calculate the maximum
number of whole shares of BHLB Common Stock issuable to such Beacon Federal
shareholder.

  



  

3.1.10 If BHLB changes (or the BHLB Board sets a related record date
that will occur before the Effective Time for a change in) the number or kind
of shares of BHLB Common Stock outstanding by way of a stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar
transaction, then the Merger Consideration (and any other dependent items)
will be adjusted proportionately to account for such change. If Beacon
Federal changes (or the Beacon Federal Board sets a related record date that
will occur before the Effective Time for a change in) the number or kind of
shares of Beacon Federal Common Stock (or Rights thereto) outstanding by way
of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification,
reorganization or similar transaction, then the Merger Consideration (and any
other dependent items) will be adjusted proportionately to account for such
change.

  



  

3.2 Election Procedures.

  



  

3.2.1 Holders of record of Beacon Federal Common Stock may elect to
receive shares of BHLB Common Stock or cash in exchange for their shares of
Beacon Federal Common Stock. The total number of shares of Beacon Federal
Common Stock to be converted into Stock Consideration pursuant to this
Section 3.2.1 shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
number of shares of Beacon Federal Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time by (y) 0.50 (the "Stock Conversion Number"). All other
shares of Beacon Federal Common Stock shall be converted into Cash
Consideration.

  



  

3.2.2 An election form and other appropriate customary transmittal
material in such form as BHLB and Beacon Federal shall mutually
agree ("Election Form") will be mailed no more than forty (40) business days
and no less than twenty (20) business days prior to the Election Deadline or
on such earlier date as BHLB and Beacon Federal shall mutually agree (the
"Mailing Date") to each holder of record of Beacon Federal Common Stock
permitting such holder, subject to the allocation and election procedures set
forth in this Section 3.2, (i) to specify the number of shares of Beacon
Federal Common Stock owned by such holder with respect to which such holder
desires to make a Cash Election in accordance with the provision of
Section 3.1.4, (ii) to specify the number of shares of Beacon Federal Common
Stock owned by such holder with respect to which such holder desires to make
a Stock Election, in accordance with the provision of Section 3.1.3, or (iii)
to indicate that such record holder has no preference as to the receipt of
cash or BHLB Common Stock for such shares. Holders of record of shares
of Beacon Federal Common Stock who hold such shares as nominees, trustees or
in other representative capacities (a "Representative") may submit multiple
Election Forms, provided that each such Election Form covers all the shares of
Beacon Federal Common Stock held by each Representative for a particular
beneficial owner. Any shares of Beacon Federal Common Stock with respect to
which the holder thereof shall not, as of the Election Deadline (as defined
in Section 3.2.3), have made an election by submission to the Exchange Agent
of an effective, properly completed Election Form shall be deemed Non-Election
Shares. Any Dissenting Shares shall be deemed shares subject to a Cash
Election, and with respect to such shares the holders thereof shall in no
event receive consideration comprised of BHLB Common Stock. BHLB shall make
available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably be requested in
writing from time to time by all Persons who become holders (or beneficial
owners) of Beacon Federal Common Stock between the record date for the
initial mailing of Election Forms and the close of business on the business
day prior to the Election Deadline (as defined in Section 3.2.3), and Beacon
Federal shall provide to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably
necessary for it to perform as specified herein.

  



   

11

--- 

    



  

3.2.3 The term "Election Deadline", as used below, shall mean 5:00
p.m., Eastern time, on the later of (i) the date of the Beacon Federal
Shareholders Meeting and (ii) the date that BHLB and Beacon Federal shall
agree is as near as practicable to five (5) business days prior to the
expected Closing Date, or such other time and date as BHLB and Beacon Federal
may mutually agree. An election shall have been properly made only if the
Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed
Election Form by the Election Deadline. Any Election Form may be revoked or
changed by the Person submitting such Election Form to the Exchange Agent by
written notice to the Exchange Agent only if such notice of revocation or
change is actually received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election
Deadline. The Certificate or Certificates relating to any revoked Election
Form shall be promptly returned without charge to the Person submitting the
Election Form to the Exchange Agent. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have discretion
to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been properly or
timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any
good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. Neither BHLB nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any
obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.

  



  

3.2.4 No later than five (5) business days after the later to occur
of the Election Deadline or the Effective Time, BHLB shall cause the Exchange
Agent to effect the allocation among holders of Beacon Federal Common Stock of
rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as set
forth in Sections 3.2.5 and 3.2.6.

  



  

3.2.5 If the aggregate number of shares of Beacon Federal Common
Stock with respect to which Stock Elections shall have been made (the
"Stock Election Number") exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then all Cash
Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and Stock Election
Shares of each holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election
Shares held by such holder by (y) the fraction, the numerator of which is the
Stock Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Stock Election
Number, with the remaining number of such holders' Stock Election Shares
being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.

  



  

3.2.6 If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock
Conversion Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds
the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the "Shortfall
Number"), then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election
Shares shall be treated in the following manner:

  



  

(A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of
Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-Election Shares of
each holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by
such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number
and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares, with
the remaining number of such holder's Non-Election Shares being converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; or

  



  

(B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election
Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration and Cash Election Shares of each holder
thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in
respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which (1)
the Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election Shares and
the denominator of which is the total number of Cash Election Shares, with
the remaining number of such holder's Cash Election Shares being converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.

3.3 Procedures for Exchange of Beacon Federal Common Stock.

  



  

3.3.1 _BHLB to Make Merger Consideration Available_. Prior to the
Effective Time, BHLB shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of Beacon Federal Common Stock,
for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.3, an aggregate amount of cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to this
Article III and shall instruct the Exchange Agent to issue such cash and
shares of BHLB Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Section
3.2 (such cash and shares of BHLB Common Stock, together with any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto (without any interest thereon) being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund").

  



  

3.3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. BHLB shall take all steps
necessary to cause the Exchange Agent, not later than five (5) Business
Days after the Effective Time, to mail to each holder of a Certificate or
Certificates who did not previously submit their Certificates with a
completed Election Form a form letter of transmittal for return to the
Exchange Agent and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares into which the Beacon Federal Common Stock represented by
such Certificates shall have been converted as a result of the Merger, if any.
The letter of transmittal shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate
for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
and the Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares or any unpaid
dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates.

  



  

3.3.3 _Rights of Certificate Holders after the Effective Time_.
The holder of a Certificate that prior to the Merger represented issued
and outstanding Beacon Federal Common Stock shall have no rights, after the
Effective Time, with respect to such Beacon Federal Common Stock except to
surrender the Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided
in this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared after the
Effective Time with respect to BHLB Common Stock shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall surrender
such Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.3. After the surrender of
a Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.3, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to shares of BHLB Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

  



  

3.3.4 _Surrender by Persons Other than Record Holders_. If the
Person surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying letter of
transmittal is not the record holder thereof, then it shall be a condition of
the payment of the Merger Consideration that: (i) such Certificate is
properly endorsed to such Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock
powers, in either case signed exactly as the name of the record holder
appears on such Certificate, and is otherwise in proper form for transfer, or
is accompanied by appropriate evidence of the authority of the Person
surrendering such Certificate and signing the letter of transmittal to do so
on behalf of the record holder; and (ii) the Person requesting such exchange
shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other
similar taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

3.3.5 _Closing of Transfer Books_. From and after the Closing
Date, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Beacon
Federal of the Beacon Federal Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent,
they shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration and canceled as provided
in this Section 3.3.

  



  

3.3.6 _Return of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the nine
(9) month period after the Effective Time, BHLB shall be entitled to require
the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund which had
been made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Certificates (including, without limitation, all interest and other income
received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to it),
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to BHLB (subject
to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) with respect to any
Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither BHLB nor the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such Certificate to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law.

3.3.7 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof.

  



  

3.3.8 _Withholding_. BHLB or the Exchange Agent will be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of
Beacon Federal Common Stock such amounts as BHLB (or any Affiliate
thereof) or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To
the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by BHLB or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Beacon Federal Common
Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by BHLB or
the Exchange Agent.

  



  

3.4 Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards.

  



  

(a) Unless otherwise noted, the provisions of this Section 3.4
pertain to all plans sponsored by Beacon Federal under which options and
other stock-based amounts are awarded, including Beacon Federal's 2008 Equity
Incentive Plan (the " _Beacon Federal Stock Plan_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that any accelerated vesting performed pursuant to this _Section 3.4_
 shall only be performed if required by the terms of the Beacon Federal Stock
Plan as in effect on the date hereof without any further action by Beacon
Federal.

  



  

(b) Each stock option issued under a Beacon Federal Stock Plan (a "
_Beacon Federal Stock Option_ ") or pursuant to any individual equity
compensation award agreement, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
and unexercised immediately before the Effective Time will cease, at the
Effective Time, to represent a right to acquire shares of Beacon Federal
Common Stock and will be converted at the Effective Time, without any action
on the part of the holder of such Beacon Federal Stock Option, into an option
to purchase BHLB Common Stock (a "Converted Stock Option"), on the same terms
and conditions as were applicable under such Beacon Federal Stock Option (but
subject to and taking into account any required acceleration of vesting of
such Beacon Federal Stock Option pursuant to the terms of the Beacon Federal
Stock Plan as in effect on the date hereof without any further action by
Beacon Federal). The number of shares of BHLB Common Stock subject to each
such Converted Stock Option will be equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the number of shares of Beacon Federal Common Stock subject to
the applicable Beacon Federal Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio, and by
dividing (x) the exercise price per Beacon Federal Stock Option in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, if the terms of the Beacon Federal Stock
Plan or the underlying award agreement so provide, each share of
restricted Beacon Federal Common Stock issued pursuant to the Beacon Federal
Stock Plan ("Beacon Federal Restricted Stock") that is outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time shall vest in full and the restrictions
thereon shall lapse, and, as of the Effective Time, each share of Beacon
Federal Common Stock that was formerly Beacon Federal Restricted Stock shall
be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
3.1.3; _provided_ , _however_ , that, upon the lapsing of restrictions with
respect to each share of Beacon Federal Restricted Stock, Beacon Federal shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld under the Code and any applicable state or local Tax
laws with respect to the lapsing of such restrictions. At the Effective Time,
each award of Beacon Federal Restricted Stock granted under the
Beacon Federal Stock Plan or pursuant to any individual equity compensation
award agreement (a "Beacon Federal Restricted Stock Award") that is
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time and that does not become
vested pursuant to the preceding sentence will cease, at the Effective Time,
to represent a right with respect to shares of Beacon Federal Common Stock and
will be converted at the Effective Time, without any action on the part of
the holder of such Beacon Federal Restricted Stock Award, to shares of BHLB
Common Stock (each, a "Converted Restricted Stock Award"), on the same terms
and conditions as were applicable under the Beacon Federal Restricted Stock
Award. The number of shares of BHLB Common Stock subject to each
such Converted Restricted Stock Award will equal the number of shares of
Beacon Federal Common Stock subject to the applicable Beacon Federal
Restricted Stock Award multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the
nearest whole share of BHLB Common Stock.

(d) The shares of BHLB Common Stock to be issued to the holders of
Beacon Federal Stock Options shall be registered with the SEC under the
Merger Registration Statement, which shall be converted by a post-effective
amendment to a registration statement on Form S-8.

  



  

3.5 Bank Merger.

  



  

BHLB intends to cause the merger of Beacon Bank with and into Berkshire Bank,
with Berkshire Bank as the surviving institution, but retains the right to
hold Beacon Bank as a separate subsidiary. Subject to the foregoing and in
BHLB's sole determination, following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, BHLB will cause Berkshire Bank, and Beacon Federal will cause
Beacon Bank, to execute and deliver an agreement and plan of merger in respect
of the Bank Merger.

  



  

3.6 Reservation of Shares.

  



  

BHLB shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of the BHLB
Common Stock for the purpose of issuing shares of BHLB Common Stock to the
Beacon Federal shareholders in accordance with this Article III.

4.6 Financial Statements.

  



  

4.6.1 The Beacon Federal Regulatory Reports have been prepared in
all material respects in accordance with applicable regulatory
accounting principles and practices throughout the periods covered by such
statements.

  



  

4.6.2 Beacon Federal has previously made available to BHLB the
Beacon Federal Financial Statements. The Beacon Federal Financial
Statements present in each case in all material respects (subject in the case
of the unaudited interim statements to normal year-end adjustments) the
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of
Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries as of and for the
respective periods ending on the dates thereof, in accordance with GAAP during
the periods involved, except as indicated in the notes thereto, or in the
case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q.

  



  

4.6.3 At the date of the most recent consolidated statement of
financial condition included in the Beacon Federal Financial Statements or in
the Beacon Federal Regulatory Reports, Beacon Federal did not have any
liabilities, obligations or loss contingencies of any nature (whether
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) of a type required to be reflected
in such Beacon Federal Financial Statements or in the Beacon Federal
Regulatory Reports or in the footnotes thereto which are not fully reflected
or reserved against therein or fully disclosed in a footnote thereto, except
for liabilities, obligations and loss contingencies which are not
material individually or in the aggregate or which are incurred in the
ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, and subject, in
the case of any unaudited statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments
and the absence of footnotes.

  



  

4.7 Taxes.

  



  

Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries are members of the same
affiliated group within the meaning of Code Section 1504(a). Beacon Federal,
on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, has timely filed or caused to be
filed all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, those filed on a
consolidated, combined or unitary basis) required to have been filed by
Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof,
or requests for extensions to file such returns and reports have been timely
filed. All such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material
respects. Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries have timely paid
or, prior to the Effective Time will pay, all Taxes, whether or not shown on
such returns or reports, due or claimed to be due to any Governmental
Entity prior to the Effective Time other than Taxes which are being contested
in good faith. Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries have
declared on their Tax Returns all positions taken therein that could give rise
to a substantial underpayment of United States Federal Income Tax within the
meaning of Section 6662 of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state
or local laws). The accrued but unpaid Taxes of Beacon Federal and the Beacon
Federal Subsidiaries did not, as of the most recent Beacon Federal Financial
Statements, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the most recent Beacon Federal balance sheet
(rather than in any notes thereto). Beacon Federal and its Subsidiaries are
subject to Tax audits in the ordinary course of business. Beacon
Federal management does not believe that an adverse resolution to any of such
audits of which it has Knowledge would be reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Beacon Federal. Beacon Federal and the Beacon
Federal Subsidiaries have not been notified in writing by any jurisdiction
that the jurisdiction believes that Beacon Federal or any of the Beacon
Federal Subsidiaries were required to file any Tax Return in such
jurisdiction that was not filed. Neither Beacon Federal nor any of the Beacon
Federal Subsidiaries (A) has been a member of a group with which they have
filed or been included in a combined, consolidated or unitary income
Tax Return other than a group the common parent of which was Beacon Federal
or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than Beacon
Federal or any of the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries) under Treas. Reg. §
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise. As of the date hereof, all
deficiencies proposed in writing as a result of any audits have been paid or
settled. There are no written claims or assessments pending against Beacon
Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary for any alleged deficiency in any
Tax, and neither Beacon Federal nor any Beacon Federal Subsidiary has been
notified in writing of any proposed Tax claims or assessments against Beacon
Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary. Beacon Federal and the Beacon
Federal Subsidiaries each have duly and timely withheld, collected and paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority all amounts required to be so
withheld and paid under all applicable laws, and have duly and timely filed
all Tax Returns with respect to such withheld Taxes, within the time
prescribed under any applicable law. Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal
Subsidiaries have delivered to BHLB true and complete copies of all Tax
Returns of Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries for taxable
periods ending on or after December 31, 2005. Neither Beacon Federal nor any
of the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries is or has been a party to any "reportable
transaction," as defined in Code § 6707A(c)(1) and Treas. Reg. § 1.6011-4(b).
Neither Beacon Federal nor any of the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries has
distributed stock of another Person, or has had its stock distributed by
another Person, in a transaction that was purported or intended to be
governed in whole or in part by Code § 355 or Code § 361\. Neither Beacon
Federal nor any of the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries has been a United States
real property holding corporation within the meaning of Code § 897(c)(2)
during the applicable period specified in Code § 897(c)(1)(A)(ii).

4.8 No Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Since December 31, 2011, to Beacon Federal's Knowledge, no event has occurred
or circumstance arisen has had or reasonably would be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Beacon Federal.

  



  

4.9 Material Contracts; Leases; Defaults.

  



  

4.9.1 Except as set forth in _Beacon Federal Disclosure Schedule
4.9.1_, neither Beacon Federal nor any Beacon Federal Subsidiary is a party
to or subject to: (i) any employment, consulting or severance contract or
arrangement with any past or present officer, director, employee or
consultant of Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary, except for "at
will" arrangements; (ii) any plan, arrangement or contract providing for
bonuses, pensions, options, deferred compensation, retirement payments,
profit sharing or similar arrangements for or with any past or present
officers, directors, employees or consultants of Beacon Federal or any Beacon
Federal Subsidiary; (iii) any agreement which by its terms limits or affects
the payment of dividends by Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary;
(iv) any instrument evidencing or related to indebtedness for borrowed money
in excess of $500,000, whether directly or indirectly, by way of purchase
money obligation, conditional sale, lease purchase, guaranty or otherwise, in
respect of which Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary is an obligor
to any Person, which instrument evidences or relates to indebtedness other
than deposits, FHLB advances with a term to maturity not in excess of one (1)
year, repurchase agreements, bankers' acceptances, and transactions in
"federal funds" or which contains financial covenants or other non-customary
restrictions (other than those relating to the payment of principal and
interest when due) which would be applicable on or after the Closing Date to
Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary; (v) any other agreement,
written or oral, which is not terminable without cause on sixty (60) days'
notice or less without penalty or payment, or that obligates Beacon Federal
or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary for the payment of more than $50,000 annually
or for the payment of more than $100,000 over its remaining term; or (vi) any
agreement (other than this Agreement), contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding (whether written or oral) that materially restricts or limits
the conduct of business by Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary.

  



  

4.9.2 Each real estate lease that will require the consent of the
lessor or its agent as a result of the Merger or the Bank Merger by virtue of
the terms of any such lease, is listed in _Beacon Federal Disclosure Schedule
4.9.2_ identifying the section of the lease that contains such prohibition or
restriction. Subject to any consents that may be required as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to its Knowledge neither Beacon
Federal nor any Beacon Federal Subsidiary is in material default under any
material contract, agreement, commitment, arrangement, lease, insurance policy
or other instrument to which it is a party, by which its assets, business, or
operations may be bound or affected, or under which it or its assets,
business, or operations receive benefits, and there has not occurred any
event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would
constitute such a default.

  



  

4.9.3 True and correct copies of agreements, contracts,
arrangements and instruments referred to in Section 4.9.1 and 4.9.2 have
been made available to BHLB on or before the date hereof, and are in full
force and effect on the date hereof. Except as set forth in  _Beacon Federal
Disclosure Schedule 4.9.3_, no such agreement, plan, contract, or arrangement
(i) provides for acceleration of the vesting of benefits or payments due
thereunder upon the occurrence of a change in ownership or control of Beacon
Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary or upon the occurrence of a
subsequent event; (ii) requires Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal
Subsidiary to provide a benefit in the form of Beacon Federal Common Stock or
determined by reference to the value of Beacon Federal Common Stock or (iii)
contains provisions which permit an employee, director or independent
contractor to terminate such agreement or arrangement without cause and
continue to accrue future benefits thereunder.

4.10 Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage.

  



  

4.10.1 Beacon Federal and each Beacon Federal Subsidiary has good
and, as to real property, marketable title to all assets and properties
owned by Beacon Federal or such Beacon Federal Subsidiary, as applicable, in
the conduct of its businesses, whether such assets and properties are real or
personal, tangible or intangible, including assets and property reflected in
the most recent consolidated statement of financial condition contained in
the Beacon Federal Financial Statements or acquired subsequent thereto (except
to the extent that such assets and properties have been disposed of in the
ordinary course of business, since the date of such consolidated statement of
financial condition), subject to no encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security
interests or pledges, except (i) those items which secure liabilities for
public or statutory obligations or any discount with, borrowing from or other
obligations to FHLB, inter-bank credit facilities, reverse repurchase
agreements or any transaction by a Beacon Federal Subsidiary acting in a
fiduciary capacity, and (ii) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent
or which are being contested in good faith. Beacon Federal and the Beacon
Federal Subsidiaries, as lessee, have the right under valid and existing
leases of real and personal properties used by Beacon Federal and the Beacon
Federal Subsidiaries in the conduct of their businesses to occupy or use all
such properties as presently occupied and used by each of them. Such existing
leases and commitments to lease constitute or will constitute
operating leases for both tax and financial accounting purposes and the lease
expense and minimum rental commitments with respect to such leases and lease
commitments are as disclosed in all material respects in the notes to the
Beacon Federal Financial Statements.

  



  

4.10.2 With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which
Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary has purchased securities
subject to an agreement to resell, if any, Beacon Federal or such Beacon
Federal Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a lien or security interest
(which to Beacon Federal's Knowledge is a valid, perfected first lien) in the
securities or other collateral securing the repurchase agreement, and the
value of such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured
thereby.

  



  

4.10.3 Beacon Federal and each Beacon Federal Subsidiary currently
maintain insurance considered by each of them to be reasonable for their
respective operations. Neither Beacon Federal nor any Beacon Federal
Subsidiary has received notice from any insurance carrier on or before the
date hereof that (i) such insurance will be canceled or that coverage
thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs with respect
to such policies of insurance will be substantially increased. Except as
listed on _Beacon Federal Disclosure Schedule 4.10.3_, there are presently
no claims pending under such policies of insurance and no notices of claim
have been given by Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary under such
policies. All such insurance is valid and enforceable and in full force and
effect (other than insurance that expires in accordance with its terms), and
within the last three (3) years Beacon Federal and each Beacon Federal
Subsidiary has received each type of insurance coverage for which it has
applied and during such periods has not been denied indemnification for any
claims submitted under any of its insurance policies. _Beacon Federal
Disclosure Schedule 4.10.3_ identifies all policies of insurance maintained
by Beacon Federal and each Beacon Federal Subsidiary, including the name of
the insurer, the policy number, the type of policy and any applicable
deductibles, as well as the other matters required to be disclosed under this
Section 4.10.3. Beacon Federal has made available to BHLB copies of all of the
policies listed on _Beacon Federal Disclosure Schedule 4.10.3_.

Except as set forth on _Beacon Federal Disclosure Schedule 4.11_, neither
Beacon Federal nor any Beacon Federal Subsidiary is a party to any, and there
are no pending or, to Beacon Federal's Knowledge, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, claims (whether asserted or
unasserted), actions or governmental investigations or inquiries of any
nature, (i) against Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary, (ii) to
which Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary's assets are or may be
subject, (iii) challenging the validity or propriety of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) which reasonably could
be expected to adversely affect the ability of Beacon Federal or any Beacon
Federal Subsidiary to perform under this Agreement.

of all written and unwritten pension, retirement, profit-sharing,
thrift, savings, deferred compensation, stock option, employee stock
ownership, employee stock purchase, restricted stock, severance

sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed to by Beacon Federal or any
of its ERISA Affiliates for the benefit of employees, former employees,
retirees (or the dependents, including spouses, of the foregoing), directors,
independent contractors or other service providers to Beacon Federal and
under which employees, former employees, retirees, dependents, spouses,
directors, or other service providers of Beacon Federal are eligible to
participate (collectively, the "Beacon Federal Benefit Plans"). Beacon
Federal has furnished or otherwise made available to BHLB true and complete
copies of (i) the plan documents and summary plan descriptions for each
written Beacon Federal Benefit Plan, (ii) a summary of each unwritten Beacon
Federal Benefit Plan (if applicable), (iii) the annual report (Form 5500
series) for the three (3) most recent years for each Beacon Federal Benefit
Plan (if applicable), (iv) the actuarial valuation reports with respect to
each tax-qualified Beacon Federal Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit
pension plan for the three (3) most recent years, (v) all related trust
agreements, insurance contracts or other funding agreements which currently
implement the Beacon Federal Benefit Plans (if applicable), (vi) the most
recent IRS determination letter with respect to each tax-qualified Beacon
Federal Benefit Plan (or, for a Beacon Federal Benefit Plan maintained under

relating to any liability of or non-compliance relating to any Beacon Federal
Benefit Plan addressed to or received from the IRS, the Department of Labor

Benefit Plan that provides for the deferral of compensation and may be
subject to Section 409A of the Code ("Beacon Federal Non-qualified Deferred
Compensation Plan") and the aggregate amounts deferred, if any, under each
such Beacon Federal Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan as of March 31,
2012. Each Beacon Federal Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan has been

4.13.2 All Beacon Federal Benefit Plans are in material compliance
with (and have been managed and administrated in accordance with) the
applicable terms of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable laws. Except as
set forth on _Beacon Federal Disclosure Schedule 4.13.2_, each Beacon
Federal Benefit Plan governed by ERISA that is intended to be a qualified
retirement plan under Section 401(a) of the Code has either (i) received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS (and Beacon Federal is not aware
of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
determination letter) or timely application has been made therefore, or (ii)
is maintained under a prototype plan which has been approved by the IRS and
is entitled to rely upon the IRS National Office opinion letter issued to the
prototype plan sponsor. To the Knowledge of Beacon Federal and the Beacon
Federal Subsidiaries, there exists no fact which would adversely affect the
qualification of any of the Beacon Federal Benefit Plans intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, or any threatened or pending
claim against any of the Beacon Federal Benefit Plans or their fiduciaries by
any participant, beneficiary or Governmental Entity (other than routine claims
for benefits).

  



  

4.13.3 Except as set forth on _Beacon Federal Disclosure Schedule
4.13.3_, no "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 414(j) of the Code)
has been maintained at any time by Beacon Federal or any of its ERISA
Affiliates for the benefit of the employees or former employees of Beacon
Federal or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

4.13.4 Within the last six (6) years, neither Beacon Federal nor any
of its ERISA Affiliates maintained or had any obligation to contribute to a
Beacon Federal Benefit Plan which is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(37) of ERISA, and within the last six (6) years neither Beacon
Federal nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any withdrawal liability
within the meaning of Section 4201 of ERISA to any such "multiemployer plan."
Neither Beacon Federal nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any
unsatisfied liability (other than PBGC premiums) to the PBGC, the IRS or any
other individual or entity under Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code, and no event or condition exists that could reasonably be expected
to result in the imposition of any liability on Beacon Federal or any of its
ERISA Affiliates under such provisions or that could reasonably be expected
to have an adverse effect on BHLB or Berkshire Bank.

  



  

4.13.5 Beacon Federal has complied in all material respects with the
notice and continuation requirements of Parts 6 and 7 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA"), and the regulations
thereunder. All reports, statements, returns and other information required
to be furnished or filed with respect to Beacon Federal Benefit Plans have
been timely furnished, filed or both in accordance with Sections 101 through
105 of ERISA and Sections 6057 through 6059 of the Code, and they are true,
correct and complete. To Beacon Federal's Knowledge, records with respect to
Beacon Federal Benefit Plans have been maintained in compliance with Section
107 of ERISA. To Beacon Federal's Knowledge, neither Beacon Federal nor
any other fiduciary (as that term is defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) with
respect to any of Beacon Federal Benefit Plans has any liability for any
breach of any fiduciary duties under Sections 404, 405 or 409 of ERISA. No
Beacon Federal Benefit Plan fails to meet the applicable requirements of
Section 105(h)(2) of the Code (determined without regard to whether such
Beacon Federal Benefit Plan is self-insured).

  



  

4.13.6 Beacon Federal has not, with respect to any Beacon Federal
Benefit Plan, nor, to Beacon Federal's Knowledge, has any administrator of
any Beacon Federal Benefit Plan, the related trusts or any trustee thereof,
engaged in any prohibited transaction which would subject Beacon Federal, any
ERISA Affiliate of Beacon Federal, or any Beacon Federal Benefit Plan to a Tax
or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by ERISA, Section 4975 of the
Code, or to any other liability under ERISA.

4.13.7 Except as set forth on _Beacon Federal Disclosure Schedule
4.13.7_, Beacon Federal has no liability for retiree health and life benefits
under any Beacon Federal Benefit Plan other than any benefits required under
COBRA or similar state laws.

  



  

4.13.8 Except as set forth on _Beacon Federal Disclosure Schedule
4.13.8_, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (A) result in any
payment (including severance) becoming due to any director or any employee of
Beacon Federal from Beacon Federal under any Beacon Federal Benefit Plan, (B)
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Beacon Federal Benefit Plan
or (C) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any
such benefit. Except as set forth on _Beacon Federal Disclosure Schedule
4.13.8_, no payment which in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement is or may reasonably be expected to be made by, from or with
respect to any Beacon Federal Benefit Plan, either alone or in conjunction
with any other payment will or could properly be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code on which an excise tax under
Section 4999 of the Code is payable or will or could, either individually or
collectively, provide for any payment by Beacon Federal or any of its
ERISA Affiliates that would not be deductible under Code Section 162(m).

  



  

4.13.9 The actuarial present values of all accrued Beacon Federal
Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plans (including, to the extent
applicable, entitlements under any executive compensation, supplemental
retirement, or employment agreement) of employees and former employees of
Beacon Federal and their respective beneficiaries, other than entitlements
accrued pursuant to funded retirement plans subject to the provisions of
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, have been fully reflected on
the Beacon Federal Financial Statements to the extent required by and in
accordance with GAAP.

  



  

4.13.10 There is not, and has not been, any trust or fund maintained
by or contributed to by Beacon Federal or its employees to fund an
employee benefit plan which would constitute a Voluntary Employees'
Beneficiary Association or a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of
Section 419(a) of the Code.

  



  

4.13.11 No claim, lawsuit, arbitration or other action has been
asserted or instituted or, to the Knowledge of Beacon Federal, has been
threatened or is anticipated, against any Beacon Federal Benefit Plan (other
than routine claims for benefits and appeals of such claims), Beacon Federal
or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary or any director, officer or employee thereof,
or any of the assets of any trust of any Beacon Federal Benefit Plan.

Neither Beacon Federal nor any Beacon Federal Subsidiary, nor any of their
respective officers, directors, employees or agents, has employed any broker,
finder or financial advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or incurred any liability or commitment for any fees or
commissions to any such Person in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement except for the retention of Keefe
Bruyette and Woods, Inc. by Beacon Federal and the fee payable pursuant
thereto. A true and correct copy of the engagement agreement with Keefe
Bruyette and Woods, Inc., setting forth the fee payable to Keefe Bruyette and

consideration in the ordinary course of Beacon Federal's and Beacon Bank'
respective businesses, and the notes or other evidences of indebtedness with

and direct control of Beacon Federal or its Subsidiaries or accountants
(including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-
exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the system of internal
accounting controls described in the following sentence. Beacon Federal and
its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP. Beacon Federal has designed and
implemented disclosure controls and procedures (within the meaning of Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that
material information relating to it and its Subsidiaries is made known to its
management by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act.

Approvals, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by BHLB and the completion by BHLB of the transactions

Except for (a) the receipt of the Regulatory Approvals and compliance with
any conditions contained therein, (b) compliance with applicable requirements

5.6 Financial Statements.

  



  

5.6.1 The BHLB Regulatory Reports have been prepared in all
material respects in accordance with applicable regulatory accounting
principles and practices throughout the periods covered by such statements.

  



  

5.6.2 BHLB has previously made available to Beacon Federal the BHLB
Financial Statements. The BHLB Financial Statements fairly present in each
case in all material respects (subject in the case of the unaudited interim
statements to normal year-end adjustments) the consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of BHLB and the Berkshire Bank
as of and for the respective periods ending on the dates thereof, in
accordance with GAAP during the periods involved, except as indicated in the
notes thereto, or in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by Form
10-Q.

  



  

5.6.3 At the date of the most recent consolidated statement of
financial condition included in the BHLB Financial Statements or in the
BHLB Regulatory Reports, BHLB did not have any liabilities, obligations or
loss contingencies of any nature (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) of a type required to be reflected in such BHLB Financial
Statements or in the footnotes thereto which are not fully reflected or
reserved against therein or fully disclosed in a footnote thereto, except for
liabilities, obligations and loss contingencies which are not material
individually or in the aggregate or which are incurred in the ordinary course
of business, consistent with past practice, and subject, in the case of any
unaudited statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments and the absence
of footnotes.

  



  

5.7 Tax Matters.

  



  

5.7.1 BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries are members of the same
affiliated group within the meaning of Code Section 1504(a). BHLB, on
behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries, has timely filed or caused to be filed
all Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, those filed on a
consolidated, combined or unitary basis) required to have been filed by BHLB
and the BHLB Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof, or requests for
extensions to file such returns and reports have been timely filed. All such
Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects. BHLB
and the BHLB Subsidiaries have timely paid or, prior to the Effective Time
will pay, all Taxes, whether or not shown on such returns or reports, due or
claimed to be due to any Governmental Entity prior to the Effective Time
other than Taxes which are being contested in good faith. BHLB and the BHLB
Subsidiaries have declared on their Tax Returns all positions taken therein
that could give rise to a substantial underpayment of United States Federal
Income Tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code (or any
corresponding provision of state or local laws). The unpaid accrued but unpaid
Taxes of BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries did not, as of the most recent BHLB
Financial Statements, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (rather than any
reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the most recent BHLB balance
sheet (rather than in any notes thereto). BHLB and its Subsidiaries are
subject to Tax audits in the ordinary course of business. BHLB management
does not believe that an adverse resolution to any of such audits of which
it has Knowledge would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect
on BHLB. BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries have not been notified in writing by
any jurisdiction that the jurisdiction believes that BHLB or any of the BHLB
Subsidiaries were required to file any Tax Return in such jurisdiction that
was not filed. Neither BHLB nor any of the BHLB Subsidiaries (A) has been a
member of a group with which they have filed or been included in a combined,
consolidated or unitary income Tax Return other than a group the common
parent of which was BHLB or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person
(other than BHLB or any of the BHLB Subsidiaries) under Treas. Reg. §
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. law), as a
transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise. As of the date hereof,
all deficiencies proposed in writing as a result of any audits have been
paid or settled. There are no written claims or assessments pending against
BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary for any alleged deficiency in any Tax, and
neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary has been notified in writing of any
proposed Tax claims or assessments against BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary. BHLB
and the BHLB Subsidiaries each have duly and timely withheld, collected and
paid over to the appropriate taxing authority all amounts required to be so
withheld and paid under all applicable laws, and have duly and timely filed
all Tax Returns with respect to such withheld Taxes, within the time
prescribed under any applicable law. BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries have
delivered to Beacon Federal true and complete copies of all Tax Returns of
BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries for taxable periods ending on or after
December 31, 2005. Neither BHLB nor any of the BHLB Subsidiaries is or has
been a party to any "reportable transaction," as defined in Code §
6707A(c)(1) and Treas. Reg. § 1.6011-4(b). Neither BHLB nor any of the BHLB
Subsidiaries has distributed stock of another Person, or has had its stock
distributed by another Person, in a transaction that was purported or
intended to be governed in whole or in part by Code § 355 or Code §
361. Neither BHLB nor any of the BHLB Subsidiaries has been a United States
real property holding corporation within the meaning of Code § 897(c)(2)
during the applicable period specified in Code § 897(c)(1)(A)(ii).

5.7.2 Except as provided in this Agreement, neither BHLB nor any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action,
has failed to take any action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other
circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

  



  

5.8 No Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Since December 31, 2011, to BHLB's Knowledge, no event has occurred or
circumstance arisen since that date which, in the aggregate, has had or
reasonably would be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on BHLB.

  



  

5.9 Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage.

  



  

5.9.1 Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.9.1_ ,
BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary has good and, as to real property,
marketable title to all assets and properties owned by BHLB or such BHLB
Subsidiary, as applicable, in the conduct of its businesses, whether such
assets and properties are real or personal, tangible or intangible, including
assets and property reflected in the most recent consolidated statement of
financial condition contained in the BHLB Financial Statements or acquired
subsequent thereto (except to the extent that such assets and properties have
been disposed of in the ordinary course of business, since the date of
such consolidated statement of financial condition), subject to no
encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests or pledges, except (i)
those items which secure liabilities for public or statutory obligations or
any discount with, borrowing from or other obligations to FHLB, inter-bank
credit facilities, reverse repurchase agreements or any transaction by an BHLB
Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity, and (ii) statutory liens for
amounts not yet delinquent or which are being contested in good faith. BHLB
and the BHLB Subsidiaries, as lessee, have the right under valid and existing
leases of real and personal properties used by BHLB and the BHLB Subsidiaries
in the conduct of their businesses to occupy or use all such properties as
presently occupied and used by each of them. Such existing leases and
commitments to lease constitute or will constitute operating leases for
both tax and financial accounting purposes and the lease expense and minimum
rental commitments with respect to such leases and lease commitments are as
disclosed in all material respects in the notes to the BHLB Financial
Statements.

  



  

5.9.2 With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which
BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an
agreement to resell, if any, BHLB or such BHLB Subsidiary, as the case may
be, has a lien or security interest (which to BHLB's Knowledge is a valid,
perfected first lien) in the securities or other collateral securing the
repurchase agreement, and the value of such collateral equals or exceeds the
amount of the debt secured thereby.

  



  

5.9.3 BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary currently maintain insurance
considered by each of them to be reasonable for their respective
operations. Neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary has received notice from any
insurance carrier on or before the date hereof that (i) such insurance will
be canceled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii)
premium costs with respect to such policies of insurance will be
substantially increased. Except as listed on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule
5.9.3_, there are presently no claims pending under such policies of
insurance and no notices of claim have been given by BHLB or any BHLB
Subsidiary under such policies. All such insurance is valid and enforceable
and in full force and effect (other than insurance that expires in accordance
with its terms), and within the last three (3) years BHLB and each BHLB
Subsidiary has received each type of insurance coverage for which it has
applied and during such periods has not been denied indemnification for any
claims submitted under any of its insurance policies. _BHLB Disclosure
Schedule 5.9.3_ identifies all policies of insurance maintained by BHLB
and each BHLB Subsidiary, including the name of the insurer, the policy
number, the type of policy and any applicable deductibles, as well as the
other matters required to be disclosed under this Section 5.9.3. BHLB has made
available to Beacon Federal copies of all of the policies listed on _BHLB
Disclosure Schedule 5.9.3_.

5.10 Legal Proceedings.

  



  

Except as disclosed on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5._10 and in Item 3 of Part
I of BHLB's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2011, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2012, neither BHLB nor any BHLB
Subsidiary is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of
BHLB, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitration or other proceedings,
claims (whether asserted or unasserted), actions or
governmental investigations or inquiries of any nature (i) against BHLB or
any BHLB Subsidiary, (ii) to which BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary's assets are
or may be subject, (iii) challenging the validity or propriety of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) which could reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the ability of BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary to
perform under this Agreement.

  



  

5.11 Compliance with Applicable Law.

  



  

Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.11_:

  



  

5.11.1 To BHLB's Knowledge, BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary is in

and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments, orders
or decrees applicable to it, its properties, assets and deposits, its

lending laws and other laws relating to discriminatory business practices, and
neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary has received any written notice to the
contrary.

  



  

5.11.2 BHLB and each BHLB Subsidiary has all material permits,
licenses, authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has made all
filings, applications and registrations with, all Governmental Entities and
Bank Regulators that are required in order to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to conduct its business as presently conducted; all such
permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in
full force and effect and, to the Knowledge of BHLB, no suspension or
cancellation of any such permit, license, certificate, order or approval is
threatened or will result from the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to obtaining the approvals set forth
in Section 8.3.

  



  

5.11.3 For the period beginning January 1, 2007, neither BHLB nor any
BHLB Subsidiary has received any written notification or any
other communication from any Bank Regulator or Insurance Regulator (i)
asserting that BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary is not in material compliance with
any of the statutes, regulations or ordinances which such Bank Regulator or
Insurance Regulator enforces; (ii) threatening to revoke any license,
franchise, permit or governmental authorization; (iii) requiring or
threatening to require BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary, or indicating that BHLB
or any BHLB Subsidiary may be required, to enter into a cease and desist
order, agreement or memorandum of understanding or any other agreement with
any federal or state governmental agency or authority which is charged with
the supervision or regulation of banks, savings and loan holding companies or
insurance agencies, or engages in the insurance of bank deposits, restricting
or limiting, or purporting to restrict or limit the operations of BHLB or any
BHLB Subsidiary, including without limitation any restriction on the payment
of dividends; or (iv) directing, restricting or limiting, or purporting to
direct, restrict or limit the operations of BHLB or any BHLB Subsidiary.
Neither BHLB nor any BHLB Subsidiary has consented to or entered into any
Regulatory Agreement that is currently in effect. The most recent regulatory
rating given to Berkshire Bank as to compliance with the CRA is
"Satisfactory" or better.

correspondence relating to any liability of or non-compliance relating to any
BHLB Benefit Plan addressed to or received from the IRS, the Department of
Labor or any other Governmental Entity within the past three (3) years. Each
BHLB Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan has been maintained and operated
in compliance with Section 409A of the Code such that no Taxes under Section
409A of the Code may be imposed on participants in such plans.

  



  

5.12.2 All BHLB Benefit Plans are in material compliance with (and
have been managed and administrated in accordance with) the applicable terms
of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable laws. Except as set forth on _BHLB
Disclosure Schedule 5.12.2_, each BHLB Benefit Plan governed by ERISA that
is intended to be a qualified retirement plan under Section 401(a) of the Code
has either (i) received a favorable determination letter from the IRS (and
BHLB is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any
such favorable determination letter) or timely application has been made
therefore, or (ii) is maintained under a prototype plan which has been
approved by the IRS and is entitled to rely upon the IRS National Office
opinion letter issued to the prototype plan sponsor. To the Knowledge of BHLB
and the BHLB Subsidiaries, there exists no fact which would adversely
affect the qualification of any of the BHLB Benefit Plans intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, or any threatened or pending
claim against any of the BHLB Benefit Plans or their fiduciaries by any
participant, beneficiary or Governmental Entity (other than routine claims
for benefits).

  



  

5.12.3 Except as set forth on _BHLB Disclosure Schedule 5.12.3_, no
"defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section 414(j) of the Code) has been
maintained at any time by BHLB or any of its ERISA Affiliates for the benefit
of the employees or former employees of BHLB or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

5.12.4 Within the last six (6) years, neither BHLB nor any of its
ERISA Affiliates maintained or had any obligation to contribute to a BHLB
Benefit Plan which is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section
3(37) of ERISA, and within the last six (6) years neither BHLB nor any of its
ERISA Affiliates has incurred any withdrawal liability within the meaning of
Section 4201 of ERISA to any such "multiemployer plan." Neither BHLB nor any
of its ERISA Affiliates has incurred any unsatisfied liability (other than
PBGC premiums) to the PBGC, the IRS or any other individual or entity under
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and no event or condition
exists that could reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of any
liability on BHLB or any of its ERISA Affiliates under such provisions or
that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on BHLB or
Berkshire Bank.

  



  

5.12.5 BHLB has complied in all material respects with the notice and
continuation requirements of Parts 6 and 7 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
and Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA"), and the regulations thereunder. All
reports, statements, returns and other information required to be furnished
or filed with respect to BHLB Benefit Plans have been timely furnished, filed
or both in accordance with Sections 101 through 105 of ERISA and Sections 6057
through 6059 of the Code, and they are true, correct and complete. To BHLB's
Knowledge, records with respect to BHLB Benefit Plans have been maintained in
compliance with Section 107 of ERISA. To BHLB's Knowledge, neither BHLB nor
any other fiduciary (as that term is defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) with
respect to any of BHLB Benefit Plans has any liability for any breach of any
fiduciary duties under Sections 404, 405 or 409 of ERISA. No BHLB Benefit
Plan fails to meet the applicable requirements of Section 105(h)(2) of the
Code (determined without regard to whether such BHLB Benefit Plan is self-
insured).

advisor in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or incurred any liability or commitment for any fees or commissions to
any such Person in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except for the retention of Sandler O'Neill and Partners, L.P. by

whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and
direct control of BHLB or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means
of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and
non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the
following sentence. BHLB and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. BHLB has designed
and implemented disclosure controls and procedures (within the meaning of
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15D-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to it and its Subsidiaries is made known to its
management by others within those entities as appropriate to allow

Act.

allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods
(including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-downs, charge-offs and
accruals) of it or any of its subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim that it or any of its subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices, and (B) no attorney representing BHLB or
any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by it or any of its
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by BHLB or any of its

of-pocket fees, expenses, or charges that Beacon Federal or any Beacon
Federal Subsidiary may incur as a result of taking, at the request of BHLB or
any BHLB Subsidiary, any action to facilitate the conversion.

  



  

6.3.3 Beacon Federal shall provide BHLB, within fifteen (15)
Business Days of the end of each calendar month, a written list of
nonperforming assets (the term "nonperforming assets," for purposes of this
subsection, means (i) loans that are "troubled debt restructuring" as defined
in Accounting Standards Codification 310-40, (ii) loans on nonaccrual, (iii)
real estate owned, (iv) all loans ninety (90) days or more past due as of the
end of such month and (v) and impaired loans. On a monthly basis, Beacon
Federal shall provide BHLB with a schedule of all (x) loan grading changes and
(y) loan approvals, which schedule shall indicate the loan amount, loan type
and other material features of the loan. Beacon Federal will promptly prepare
and provide BHLB with the minutes of all Beacon Federal and Beacon Bank
officer and director loan committee meetings.

  



  

6.3.4 Beacon Federal shall promptly inform BHLB, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, upon receiving notice of any legal,
administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, demands, notices, audits or
investigations (by any federal, state or local commission, agency or board)
relating to the alleged liability of Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal
Subsidiary under any labor or employment law.

  



  

6.4 Access to Properties and Records.

  



  

Subject to Section 11.1, Beacon Federal shall permit BHLB access upon
reasonable notice and at reasonable times to its properties and those of the
Beacon Federal Subsidiaries, and shall disclose and make available to BHLB
during normal business hours all of its books and records relating to the
assets, properties, operations, obligations and liabilities, including, but
not limited to, all books of account (including the general ledger), tax
records, minute books of directors' and shareholders' meetings (other than
minutes that discuss any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any other subject matter that Beacon Federal reasonably determines should be
kept confidential), organizational documents, bylaws, material contracts and
agreements, filings with any regulatory authority, litigation files, plans
affecting employees, and any other business activities or prospects in which
BHLB may have a reasonable interest; _provided, however,_ that Beacon Federal
shall not be required to take any action that would provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure, in Beacon Federal's
reasonable judgment, would interfere with the normal conduct of Beacon
Federal's business or would violate or prejudice the rights or
business interests or confidences of any customer or other Person or entity
or would result in the waiver by it of the privilege
protecting communications between it and any of its counsel or contravene any
applicable law. Beacon Federal shall provide and shall request its auditors
to provide BHLB with such historical financial information regarding it (and
related audit reports and consents) as BHLB may reasonably request for
Securities Law disclosure purposes. BHLB shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize any interference with Beacon Federal's regular business
operations during any such access to Beacon Federal's property, books and
records. Beacon Federal and each Beacon Federal Subsidiary shall permit BHLB,
at BHLB's expense, to (i) cause a Phase I environmental assessment to be
performed at any physical location owned or occupied by Beacon Federal or any
Beacon Federal Subsidiary and (ii) cause an appraisal to be performed in
respect of any real property owned by Beacon Federal or any Beacon
Federal Subsidiary.

6.5.1 Promptly upon receipt thereof, Beacon Federal will furnish to
BHLB copies of each annual, interim or special audit of the financial
statements of Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries made by its
independent registered public accountants and copies of all internal control
reports submitted to Beacon Federal by such accountants, or by any other
accounting firm rendering internal audit services, in connection with each
annual, interim or special audit of the financial statements of Beacon Federal
and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries made by such accountants.

  



  

6.5.2 As soon as reasonably available, but in no event later than
the date such documents are filed with the OCC or FRB, Beacon Federal will
deliver to BHLB the Beacon Federal Regulatory Report filed by Beacon Federal
or Beacon Bank. Within twenty-five (25) days after the end of each month,
Beacon Bank will deliver to BHLB a consolidating balance sheet and a
consolidating statement of operations, without related notes, for such month
prepared in accordance with current financial reporting practices, as well as
a month-end and year to date comparison to budget.

  



  

6.5.3 Beacon Federal shall permit BHLB to review substantially
final drafts of its quarterly and annual reports on Forms 10-Q and 10-K,
respectively, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date such documents
are filed with the SEC. Beacon Federal promptly will advise upon receipt and
permit review by BHLB of any inquiry or examination report of any Bank
Regulator with respect to the condition or activities of Beacon Federal or
Beacon Bank.

  



  

6.5.4 With reasonable promptness, Beacon Federal will furnish to
BHLB such additional financial data that Beacon Federal possesses and as BHLB
may reasonably request, including without limitation, detailed monthly
financial statements and loan reports and detailed deposit reports.

  



  

6.6 Maintenance of Insurance.

  



  

Beacon Federal shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, and to
cause the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries to maintain, insurance in such amounts
as are reasonable to cover such risks as are customary in relation to the
character and location of its properties and the nature of its business, with
such coverage and in such amounts not less than that maintained by Beacon
Federal and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement
and set forth in _Beacon Federal Disclosure Schedule 4.10.3_. Beacon Federal
will promptly inform BHLB if Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary
receives notice from an insurance carrier that (i) an insurance policy will
be canceled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii)
premium costs with respect to any policy of insurance will be substantially
increased.

  



  

6.7 Disclosure Supplements.

  



  

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, Beacon Federal will promptly
supplement or amend the Beacon Federal Disclosure Schedule delivered in
connection herewith with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if
existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be set forth or described in such Beacon Federal Disclosure
Schedule or which is necessary to correct any information in such Beacon
Federal Disclosure Schedule which has been rendered materially
inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such Beacon Federal
Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect for the purpose of
determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX.

6.8 Consents and Approvals of Third Parties.

  



  

Beacon Federal shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause
each Beacon Federal Subsidiary to use its commercially reasonable efforts, to
obtain as soon as practicable all consents and approvals of any other Persons
or entities necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

6.9 All Reasonable Efforts.

  



  

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, Beacon Federal agrees to
use, and agrees to cause each Beacon Federal Subsidiary to use, all
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

6.10 Failure to Fulfill Conditions.

  



  

In the event that Beacon Federal determines that a condition to its
obligation to complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will
not waive that condition, it will promptly notify BHLB.

  



  

6.11 No Solicitation.

  



  

From and after the date hereof until the termination of this Agreement,
Beacon Federal shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any
Beacon Federal Subsidiary or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, representatives, agents and affiliates (including, without
limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by Beacon
Federal or any of the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries), directly or indirectly,
initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-
public information or assistance) any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal (as defined below), or enter into or maintain or continue discussions
or negotiate with any Person in furtherance of such inquiries or to obtain an
Acquisition Proposal or agree to or endorse any Acquisition Proposal, 
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 6.11 shall
prohibit the Board of Directors of Beacon Federal from (i) complying with its
disclosure obligations under federal or state law; or (ii) prior to the time
that the Beacon Federal shareholders meeting has occurred, furnishing
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Person
or entity that makes an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, if, and only to the
extent that, (A) the Board of Directors of Beacon Federal determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial and legal advisors), taking into
account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the
Person making the proposal, that such proposal, if consummated, is reasonably
likely to result in a transaction more favorable to Beacon Federal's
shareholders from a financial point of view than the Merger; and (B) such
Acquisition Proposal was not solicited by Beacon Federal and did not otherwise
result from a breach of this Section 6.11 by Beacon (such proposal that
satisfies clauses (A) and (B) being referred to herein as a
"Superior Proposal"); and _provided_ , _further_ , nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit Beacon Federal from (i) issuing a "stop-look-and-
listen communication" pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) or taking and disclosing to
its shareholders a position as required by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) otherwise disclosing any
information to its shareholders that the Board of Directors of Beacon Federal
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel)
that it is required to disclose in order to not breach its fiduciary duties to
Beacon Federal's shareholders under applicable law, subject to compliance
with the requirements of this Section 6.11. Beacon Federal shall promptly, but
in no event later than two (2) calendar days, notify BHLB of such inquiries,
proposals or offers received by, any such information requested from, or any
such discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with
Beacon Federal or any of its representatives indicating, in connection with
such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of
any inquiries, proposals or offers, and receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement in form and substance identical in all
material respects to the Confidentiality Agreements. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any proposal or offer as to any
of the following (other than the transactions contemplated hereunder)
involving Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary: (i) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, or other similar
transactions; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or
other disposition of 25% or more of the assets of Beacon Federal and the
Beacon Federal Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or
series of transactions; (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer for 25% or
more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Beacon Federal or the
filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act in connection
therewith; or (iv) any public announcement of a proposal, plan or
intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the
foregoing.

6.12 Reserves and Merger-Related Costs.

  



  

Prior to the Effective Time, each of Beacon Federal and its Subsidiaries
shall, consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC
and applicable U.S. banking laws and regulations, modify or change its loan,
OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real estate valuation policies
and practices (including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to
be applied on a basis that is consistent with that of BHLB, provided,
however, that no such modifications or changes need be made prior to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 9.1.1 and 9.1.3;
_provided further,_ that in any event, no accrual or reserve made by Beacon
Federal or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 6.12 shall
constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other
provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether
any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The
recording of any such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any
misstatement of previously furnished financial statements or information and
shall not be construed as concurrence of Beacon Federal or its management with
any such adjustments.

  



  

6.13 Board Meetings.

  



  

Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries shall permit one (1)
representative of BHLB to attend any meeting of their Board of Directors or
the committees thereof, and to attend any loan committee meetings (to the
extent permitted by law or appropriate regulatory authorities) as an observer
(the "Observer") provided that neither Beacon Federal nor any Beacon Federal
Subsidiary shall be required to permit the Observer to remain present during
any confidential discussion of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby or any Acquisition Proposal or during any
other matter that the respective Board of Directors has been advised of by
counsel that such attendance by the Observer may violate a confidentiality
obligation or fiduciary duty or any legal, regulatory or NASDAQ requirement.

  



  

6.14 ESOP Loan.

  



  

In no event later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time,
Beacon Federal shall cause the Beacon Federal ESOP trustee to repay in full
the outstanding indebtedness of the Beacon Federal ESOP, subject to the terms
of the Beacon Federal ESOP, by delivering a sufficient number of unallocated
shares of Beacon Federal Common Stock to Beacon Federal, subject to and in
accordance with applicable law. Not later than the Effective Time, all
remaining shares of Beacon Federal Common Stock held by the Beacon Federal
ESOP as at the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration. The Beacon Federal ESOP account balances shall not
be distributed to Beacon Federal ESOP participants unless the Beacon Federal
ESOP has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS. Beacon
Federal and, following the Effective Time, BHLB, will adopt such amendments
to the Beacon Federal ESOP to effect the provisions of this Section 6.14. In
the event that the Closing Date occurs prior to December 31, 2012, Beacon
Federal may make a pro rata payment on the outstanding ESOP indebtedness of
the amount accrued through the Closing Date, which accruals shall be made
consistent with past practice.

  



  

6.15 401(k) Plan Termination.

  



  

If requested by BHLB in writing prior to the Effective Time, and subject to
the occurrence of the Effective Time, Beacon Federal shall cause to be
adopted prior to the Effective Time resolutions of the Board of Directors of
Beacon Federal and any necessary amendments to terminate any and all 401(k)
Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time or cease all contributions to
any and all 401(k) Plan maintained or sponsored by Beacon Federal or any of
its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "401(k) Plan"), and to prohibit the entry
of new participants to the 401(k) Plan as of the day preceding the Closing
Date. In the sole discretion of BHLB, the 401(k) Plan may be merged into the
BHLB 401(k) Plan or terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
form and substance of such resolutions and any necessary amendments shall be
subject to the review and approval of BHLB, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Beacon Federal shall deliver to BHLB an executed copy of such
resolutions and any necessary amendments as soon as practicable
following their adoption by the Board of Directors of Beacon Federal and
shall fully comply with such resolutions and any necessary amendments. If, in
accordance with this Section 6.15, BHLB requests in writing that Beacon
Federal freeze entry of new participants into the 401(k) Plan, Beacon Federal
shall take such actions as BHLB may reasonably require in furtherance of the
assumption of the 401(k) Plan by BHLB, including, but not limited to,
adopting such amendments to the 401(k) Plan as may be necessary to effect such
assumption.

6.16 Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act.

  



  

If requested by BHLB, Beacon Federal shall take all such actions as BHLB may
request in order to fully and timely comply with any and all requirements of
both the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988
("WARN Act") and any state specific WARN Act statutes, including providing
notices to Beacon Federal's employees.

  



  

ARTICLE VII 
 COVENANTS OF BHLB

  



  

7.1 Conduct of Business.

  



  

7.1.1 _Covenants of BHLB_.

  



  

(A) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, except with the written consent of Beacon Federal, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, BHLB will,
and it will cause each BHLB Subsidiary to: operate its business only in the
usual, regular and ordinary course of business; use reasonable best efforts to
preserve intact its business organization and assets and maintain its rights
and franchises; and voluntarily take no action which would (i) change or waive
any provision of its certificate of incorporation (or articles or
organization in the case of Berkshire Bank) or bylaws in any way adverse
to the rights of the Beacon Federal shareholders, except as required by law;
(ii) materially adversely affect the ability of the parties to obtain the
Regulatory Approvals or materially increase the period of time necessary to
obtain such approvals or consummate the Merger; (iii) materially adversely
affect its ability to perform its covenants and agreements under this
Agreement; (iv) result in the representations and warranties contained in
Article V of this Agreement not being true and correct on the date of
this Agreement or at any future date on or prior to the Closing Date or in
any of the conditions set forth in Article IX hereof not being satisfied; (v)
prevent or impede, or be reasonably likely to prevent or impede, the Merger
from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

  



  

(B) Prior to the Effective Time, BHLB shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent the Exchange Fund.

  



  

(C) BHLB agrees that from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, except as otherwise specifically permitted or required by
this Agreement or consented to by Beacon Federal in writing, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, it will not, and
it will cause each of the BHLB Subsidiaries not to, enter into any agreement
to acquire or invest in, or make any acquisition of or investment in, any
entity, if such acquisition or investment is reasonably likely to jeopardize
receipt of any Regulatory Approvals.

  



  

7.2 Disclosure Supplements.

  



  

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, BHLB will promptly supplement
or amend the BHLB Disclosure Schedule delivered in connection herewith with
respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known
at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such BHLB Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to correct
any information in such BHLB Disclosure Schedule which has been rendered
materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such BHLB
Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect for the purpose of determining
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX.

  



   

45 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

7.3 Consents and Approvals of Third Parties.

  



  

BHLB shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause each BHLB
Subsidiary to use its commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain as soon as
practicable all consents and approvals of any other Persons necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

7.4 Reasonable Best Efforts.

  



  

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, BHLB agrees to use and
agrees to cause each BHLB Subsidiary to use reasonable best efforts in good
faith to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable.

  



  

7.5 Failure to Fulfill Conditions.

  



  

In the event that BHLB determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that
condition, it will promptly notify Beacon Federal.

  



  

7.6 Employee Matters.

  



  

7.6.1 _Definition_. "Benefit Plan Determination Date" for purposes
of this Section shall mean that date selected by BHLB with respect to each
Beacon Federal Benefit Plan to be maintained, frozen, terminated or replaced
with a similar plan or program provided by BHLB or Berkshire Bank (as used in
this Section, BHLB and Berkshire Bank are collectively referred to as "BHLB")
to other employees similarly situated; provided, that, the definition of
"Benefit Plan Determination Date" shall be consistent with the premise that
the compensation, employee benefits and terms and conditions of employment
that are provided by BHLB after the Closing Date to Continuing Beacon Federal
Employees shall be no less favorable than those provided by BHLB to similarly
situated employees of BHLB.

  



  

7.6.2 _General Rule: Parity in Benefits; No Gaps; Credit for
Service with Beacon Federal_. Within a reasonable period after the Closing
Date, but not before the applicable Benefit Plan Determination Date, BHLB
shall provide (or shall cause to be provided by a Subsidiary of BHLB) to all
individuals who are employees of Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal
Subsidiary at the Closing Date and who remain so employed immediately
following the Effective Time (the "Continuing Beacon Federal Employees"),
compensation, employee benefits and terms and conditions of employment that
are substantially similar to those provided by BHLB to similarly situated
employees of BHLB. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, none
of the provisions contained herein shall (i) operate to duplicate any benefit
provided to any Continuing Beacon Federal Employees or the funding of any such
benefit, (ii) be construed to limit the ability of BHLB to review employee
benefit plans, programs and arrangements from time to time, to make such
changes as BHLB deems appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion or to
terminate such employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements provided
that no such action shall discriminate against Continuing Beacon Federal
Employees relative to similarly situated employees of BHLB, (iii) create
third party rights against BHLB. BHLB will use best efforts to cause its
insurance providers to waive all pre-existing condition limitations and proof
of insurability provisions (to the extent such limitations and provisions did
not apply to a pre-existing condition under Beacon Federal's equivalent plan)
and eligibility waiting periods under such plans that would otherwise be
applicable to newly-hired employees for all Continuing Beacon
Federal Employees; provided that nothing in this sentence shall limit the
ability of BHLB to amend or enter into new or different employee benefit
plans or arrangements provided such plans or arrangements treat the Continuing
Beacon Federal Employees in a substantially similar manner as employees of
BHLB are treated. In the event BHLB is unable to eliminate the eligibility
waiting period for health care coverage for Continuing Beacon Federal
Employees, BHLB shall provide such employees with health care continuation
coverage under COBRA at its own expense during any waiting period. BHLB will
cause its insurance providers to honor under such plans any deductible, co-
payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Continuing Beacon Federal
Employees and their covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
prior to the relevant Benefit Plan Determination Date. Under all BHLB Benefit
Plans, service with Beacon Federal or a Beacon Federal Subsidiary shall be
deemed to be service with BHLB for eligibility and vesting purposes only, but
not for purposes of benefit accrual.

  



   

46 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

7.6.3 _BHLB 401(k) Plan Participation_. BHLB will use its best
efforts to cause each Continuing Beacon Federal Employee to be eligible
to participate in BHLB's 401(k) plan on the day after or as soon as
practicable after the Benefit Plan Determination Date for the Beacon Federal
401(k) Plan. All rights to participate in BHLB's 401(k) Plan are subject to
BHLB's right to amend or terminate BHLB's 401(k) plan in its sole and
absolute discretion and are subject to the terms of BHLB's 401(k)
Plan including, but not limited to, the eligibility and vesting provisions of
such plan.

  



  

7.6.4 _Employee Stock Ownership Plan_. BHLB agrees to take all
such actions related to the Beacon Federal ESOP as stated in Section 6.14 of
this Agreement.

  



  

7.6.5 _Welfare Benefits_. Each Continuing Beacon Federal Employee
who remains employed on the Benefit Plan Determination Date shall be
eligible to participate in group hospitalization, medical, dental, life,
disability and other welfare benefit plans and programs available to
similarly-situated employees of BHLB, subject to the terms of such plans and
programs, and subject to complying with eligibility requirements of the
respective plans and programs. With respect to any welfare benefit plan or
program of Beacon Federal that BHLB determines, in its sole and absolute
discretion, provides benefits of the same type or class as a corresponding
plan or program maintained by BHLB, BHLB shall, unless financially burdensome
or resulting in an excise tax payable by BHLB under Code Section 4980D,
continue such Beacon Federal plan or program in effect for the benefit of the
Continuing Beacon Federal Employees until the later of the open enrollment
period with respect to the year following the year in which the Merger occurs
or each Continuing Beacon Federal Employee becomes eligible to become
participants in the corresponding benefit plan or program maintained by
BHLB (and, with respect to any such plan or program, subject to complying
with eligibility requirements and subject to the right of BHLB to terminate
or amend such plan or program) so that each Continuing Beacon Federal Employee
employed by BHLB has no gap in coverage under any hospitalization, medical,
dental, life, disability or other welfare plan or program. For purposes of all
employee welfare benefit plans, programs and agreements maintained by or
contributed to by BHLB, BHLB shall treat, and in the case of an insured plan,
shall use its best efforts to cause the providers of each such plan, program
or arrangement to treat the service with Beacon Federal prior to the Closing
Date of any Continuing Beacon Federal Employee (to the same extent such
service is recognized under analogous plans, programs or arrangements of
Beacon Federal prior to the Closing) as service rendered to BHLB for all
purposes; provided, however, that such crediting of service shall not operate
to duplicate any benefit or the funding of such benefit available to any
Continuing Beacon Federal Employee. Persons who were employed by Beacon
Federal or any Affiliate and who were entitled to continue health coverage
under COBRA or any similar state law shall continue to be entitled to COBRA
coverage and coverage under similar state law under the Beacon Federal
Benefit Plans that are health plans and, in the event of a termination of such
plans, BHLB shall continue to provide COBRA coverage.

  



  

7.6.6 _Paid Time Off Programs_. BHLB will give each Continuing
Beacon Federal Employee credit, for purposes of BHLB's vacation and/or other
paid leave benefit programs, for such individual's accrued and unpaid vacation
and/or paid leave balance with Beacon Federal as of the Closing Date.

  



  

7.6.7 _BHLB to Honor Agreements_. Subject to any required
regulatory approval or satisfaction of a condition in any regulatory
approval, BHLB agrees to comply with the contractual terms of all employment
agreements, change in control agreements, severance agreements, deferred
compensation agreements and consulting agreements that Beacon Federal has with
its current and former employees and which have been identified in _Beacon
Federal Disclosure Schedule 4.9.1_, except to the extent any such agreements
shall be superseded or terminated at the Closing Date or following the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything contained in the agreements set forth
on _Beacon Federal Disclosure Schedule 4.9.1_ or in this Agreement, no payment
shall be made under any employment, deferred compensation, change of control,
severance contract, stock option plan or plan that would constitute a
"parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G of the Code),
and to the extent any such payment would constitute a "parachute payment,"
the payment will be reduced to $1.00 less than the amount that would be
considered a "parachute payment."

  



   

47

--- 

    



  

Except for the agreements described in the preceding sentences of this
Section 7.6.7 and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, subject to
and following the occurrence of the Effective Time, the Beacon Federal Benefit
Plans shall, in the sole and absolute discretion of BHLB, be frozen,
terminated or merged into comparable plans of BHLB, effective at such time as
BHLB shall determine in its sole and absolute discretion.

  



  

7.6.8 _No Guarantee of Employment_. Except to the extent of
commitments herein or other contractual commitments, if any,
specifically made or assumed by BHLB hereunder or by operation of law, BHLB
shall have no obligation arising from and after the Closing Date to continue
in its employ or in any specific job or to provide to any specified level of
compensation or any incentive payments, benefits or perquisites to any Person
who is an employee of Beacon Federal as of the Closing Date. Each Person who
is an employee of Beacon Federal as of the Closing Date and who is terminated
by BHLB for a reason other than cause within twelve (12) months subsequent to
the Closing Date or is not offered employment with BHLB as of the Effective
Time or resigns for good reason, excluding those employees who are entitled
to benefits under change of control arrangements, shall be entitled to
severance benefits pursuant to Beacon Federal's severance plan or policy, or
BHLB's current severance plan or policy, if such payments would be more
favorable to such Person.

  



  

7.6.9 _Excess Benefit Plan._ Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, Beacon Federal shall, in cooperation with BHLB, terminate each of
the Beacon Federal Bancorp, Inc. Excess Benefit Plan effective November 1,
2008, and the Deferred Compensation Plan and Trust for Ross Prossner, and the
amounts due thereunder shall be paid in a lump sum to the participants
therein, on or prior to the Effective Time in accordance with Section 409A of
the Code.

  



  

7.7 Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance.

  



  

7.7.1 BHLB shall maintain in effect for six (6) years following the
Effective Time, the current directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies maintained by Beacon Federal (provided, that BHLB may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and
conditions which are not materially less favorable) with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event
shall BHLB be required to expend pursuant to this Section 7.7.1 more than an
amount equal to 150% of the current annual amount expended by Beacon Federal
with respect to such insurance, as set forth in _Beacon Federal Disclosure
Schedule 7.7.1_ (the "Maximum Amount"); provided, further, that if the amount
of the aggregate premium necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, BHLB shall maintain the most
advantageous policies of directors and officers insurance obtainable for an
annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In connection with the foregoing,
Beacon Federal agrees in order for BHLB to fulfill its agreement to provide
directors and officers liability insurance policies for six (6) years to
provide such insurer or substitute insurer with such representations as such
insurer may request with respect to the reporting of any prior claims.

  



  

7.7.2 In addition to Section 7.7.1, BHLB shall, from and after the
Effective Date, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law and the
current provisions of the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable
organizational documents) of Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal
Subsidiaries (to the extent not prohibited by federal law), indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each Person who is now, or who has been at any time before
the date hereof or who becomes before the Effective Time, an officer or
director of Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary (the "Indemnified
Parties") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including
attorneys' fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in
settlement (which settlement shall require the prior written consent of BHLB,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of
or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, or administrative (each, a "Claim") in which an
Indemnified Party is or is threatened to be made a party or witness in whole
or in part or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such Person is
or was a director of Beacon Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary or was
prior to the Effective Time serving at the request of any such party as a
director, officer, employee, trustee or partner of another Person or
benefit plan if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing,
or occurring before the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether
such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the Effective Time. Any
Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 7.7.2
upon learning of any Claim, shall notify BHLB (but the failure so to notify
BHLB shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have under this
Section 7.7.2, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices BHLB).
In the event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time) (1) BHLB shall have the right to assume the defense thereof (in
which event the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such
matter) and upon such assumption BHLB shall not be liable to any Indemnified
Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof, except that if BHLB elects not to assume such defense, or counsel for
the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that there
are or may be (whether or not any have yet actually arisen) issues which
raise conflicts of interest between BHLB and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them, and
BHLB shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties, (2) except to the extent otherwise required due to
conflicts of interest, BHLB shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to
pay for only one (1) firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties unless there
is a conflict of interest that necessitates more than one law firm, and (3)
BHLB shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). BHLB shall also advance expenses as incurred in each case upon
receipt of an undertaking from the Indemnified Party to repay such advanced
expenses if it is determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party was not entitled to
indemnification hereunder.

assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of BHLB shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.7.

  



  

7.7.4 The obligations of BHLB provided under this Section 7.7 are
intended to be enforceable against BHLB directly by the Indemnified Parties
and shall be binding on all respective successors and permitted assigns of
BHLB.

BHLB agrees to file a notification form prior to the Effective Time for the
listing on the NASDAQ Stock Market (or such other national securities exchange
on which the shares of BHLB Common Stock shall be listed as of the Closing
Date) of the shares of BHLB Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.

  



  

7.9 Reservation of Stock.

  



  

BHLB agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the Merger
Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of shares
of BHLB Common Stock to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

7.10 Communications to Beacon Federal Employees; Training

  



  

BHLB and Beacon Federal agree that as promptly as practicable following the
execution of this Agreement, meetings with employees of Beacon Federal and
the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries shall be held at such locations as BHLB and
Beacon Federal shall mutually agree, provided that representatives of Beacon
Federal shall be permitted to attend such meetings. BHLB and Beacon Federal
shall mutually agree in advance as to the scope and content of all
communications to the employees of Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal
Subsidiaries regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereunder. At mutually agreed upon times following execution of this
Agreement, representatives of BHLB shall be permitted to meet with the
employees of Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal Subsidiaries to discuss
employment opportunities with BHLB, provided that representatives of Beacon
Federal shall be permitted to attend any such meeting. From and after the
first date on which all Regulatory Approvals (and waivers, if applicable) and
the Beacon Federal Shareholder Approval (disregarding any waiting period)
have been obtained, BHLB shall also be permitted to conduct training sessions
outside of normal business hours or at other times as Beacon Federal may
agree, with the employees of Beacon Federal and the Beacon Federal
Subsidiaries and may conduct such training seminars at any branch location of
Beacon Bank; provided that BHLB will in good faith attempt to schedule such
training sessions in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with
Beacon Bank's normal business operations.

Beacon Federal will (i) take all steps necessary to duly call, give notice

solicitation of proxies with respect to the Beacon Federal Shareholders

the Beacon Federal shareholders; and (iii) cooperate and consult with BHLB
with respect to each of the foregoing matters. The Board of Directors of
Beacon Federal may fail to make such a recommendation referred to in clause

such Board of Directors, after having consulted with and considered the
advice of its financial and legal advisors, has determined that the making of
such recommendation, or the failure to withdraw, modify or change its
recommendation, would constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of such
directors under applicable law.

  



  

8.2 Proxy Statement-Prospectus; Merger Registration Statement.

  



  

8.2.1 For the purposes (i) of registering BHLB Common Stock to be

Beacon Federal Shareholders Meeting, BHLB shall draft and prepare, and Beacon
Federal shall cooperate in the preparation of, the Merger Registration
Statement, including a proxy statement and prospectus satisfying all
applicable requirements of applicable state securities and banking laws, and
of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations
thereunder (such proxy statement/prospectus in the form mailed by Beacon
Federal to the Beacon Federal shareholders, together with any and all
amendments or supplements thereto, being herein referred to as the "Proxy
Statement-Prospectus"). BHLB shall provide Beacon Federal and its counsel with
appropriate opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus, and shall incorporate all appropriate comments thereto, prior to
the time it is initially filed with the SEC or any amendments are filed with
the SEC. Each of BHLB and Beacon Federal shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Merger Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and Beacon
Federal shall thereafter promptly mail the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to its
shareholders. BHLB shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
necessary state securities law or "blue sky" permits and approvals
required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
Beacon Federal shall furnish all information concerning Beacon Federal and
the holders of Beacon Federal Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action.

  



  

8.2.2 BHLB shall, as soon as practicable, file the Merger

Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment has
been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the
registration of the shares of BHLB Common Stock issuable pursuant to the
Merger Registration Statement, or the initiation or threat of any proceeding
for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment
or supplement of the Merger Registration Statement, or for additional
information, and BHLB will provide Beacon Federal with as many copies of such
Merger Registration Statement and all amendments thereto promptly upon the
filing thereof as Beacon Federal may reasonably request.

  



  

8.2.3 Beacon Federal and BHLB shall promptly notify the other party
if at any time it becomes aware that the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or
the Merger Registration Statement contains any untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In such event,
Beacon Federal shall cooperate with BHLB in the preparation of a supplement or
amendment to such Proxy Statement-Prospectus that corrects such misstatement
or omission, and BHLB shall file an amended Merger Registration
Statement with the SEC, and each of Beacon Federal and BHLB shall mail an
amended Proxy Statement-Prospectus to their respective shareholders.

reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and as soon as practicable following
the date hereof file all necessary documentation to obtain all necessary
permits, consents, waivers, approvals and authorizations of the Bank
Regulators or any other third parties or Governmental Entities necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Beacon
Federal and BHLB will furnish each other and each other's counsel with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and shareholders and such other matters as may be necessary or advisable in
connection with any application, petition or other statement made by or on
behalf of Beacon Federal or BHLB to any Bank Regulator or Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger, Bank Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Beacon Federal shall have the right to review

made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with
any Governmental Entity. In addition, Beacon Federal and BHLB shall each
furnish to the other for review a copy of each such filing made in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental
Entity prior to its filing. Each of Beacon Federal and BHLB will cooperate

Date or shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days after written
notice of such breach by the terminating party to the other party, conditioned
upon the breaching party promptly commencing to cure the breach and
thereafter continuing to cure the breach; provided, however, that neither
party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.1.2 unless the breach of representation or warranty, together with
all other such breaches, would entitle the terminating party not to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby under Section 9.2.1 (in the case of a
breach of a representation or warranty by Beacon Federal) or Section 9.3.1
(in the case of a breach of a representation or warranty by BHLB);

  



  

10.1.3 By either party (provided, that the terminating party is not
then in breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other

comply with any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement on

cannot be cured prior to the Closing Date or shall not have been cured within
thirty (30) days after written notice of such failure by the terminating party
to the other party, conditioned upon the breaching party promptly commencing
to cure the breach and thereafter continuing to cure; provided, however, that

of a breach of covenant by BHLB);

  



  

10.1.4 By either party, if the Closing shall not have occurred by
the Termination Date, or such later date as shall have been agreed to
in writing by BHLB and Beacon Federal; provided, that no party may terminate

adverse to BHLB.

  



  

10.1.8 By Beacon Federal if Beacon Federal has received a Superior
Proposal and the Board of Directors of Beacon Federal has made a

expiration of five (5) Business Days following BHLB's receipt of written
notice advising BHLB that Beacon Federal has received a Superior Proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and
including a copy thereof with all accompanying documentation, if in writing)
identifying the Person making the Superior Proposal and stating whether Beacon
Federal intends to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the
Superior Proposal (a "Notice of Superior Proposal"). After providing such
Notice of Superior Proposal, Beacon Federal shall provide a reasonable
opportunity to BHLB during the five (5)-day period to make such adjustments
in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable Beacon Federal
to proceed with the Merger on such adjusted terms. Any material amendment of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and
Beacon Federal shall be required to comply again with the requirements of
this Section 10.1.8; _provided_ , _however_ , that references to the five (5)
Business Day period above shall be deemed to be references to a two (2)
Business Day period.

10.1.9 By Beacon Federal, at any time during the five-day period commencing

are satisfied:

  



  

(1) The BHLB Market Value on the Determination Date is less than
$17.82; and

  



  

(2) the number obtained by dividing the BHLB Market Value on the

number obtained by dividing (x) the Final Index Price by (y) the Initial Index
Price and subtracting 0.20;

  



  

 _subject_ , _however_ , to the following three sentences.

  



  

If Beacon Federal elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to this
Section 10.1.9, it shall give written notice to BHLB not later than the end of
the third Business Day next following the Determination Date. During the five
Business Day period commencing with its receipt of such notice, BHLB may, at
its option, increase the Exchange Ratio to a number equal to the lesser of (x)
a quotient (rounded to the nearest one-ten-thousandth), the numerator of
which is equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and
the Index Ratio, and the denominator of which is equal to the BHLB Ratio, or
(y) a quotient (rounded to the nearest one-ten-thousandth), the numerator of
which is the product of the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect), the Initial
BHLB Market Value and 0.80, and the denominator of which is the BHLB Market
Value. If BHLB makes an election contemplated by the preceding sentence within
such five Business Day period, it shall give prompt written notice to Beacon
Federal of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no
termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 10.1.9 and this
Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the
Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified), and any references in this
Agreement to "Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the
Exchange Ratio as adjusted pursuant to this Section 10.1.9.

the Index shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any
stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,

(A) Except as provided below, whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
by the party incurring such expenses.

  



  

(B) In the event of a termination of this Agreement because of a
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement, the breaching party shall remain liable for any and all
damages, costs and expenses, sustained or incurred by the non-breaching party
as a result thereof or in connection therewith or with respect to the
enforcement of its rights hereunder.

  



  

(C) As a condition of BHLB's willingness, and in order to induce BHLB
to enter into this Agreement, and to reimburse BHLB for incurring the costs
and expenses related to entering into this Agreement and consummating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Beacon Federal hereby agrees to
pay BHLB, and BHLB shall be entitled to payment of, $5.28 million (the
"Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same day funds on the earlier of (x)
the date of termination or, if such date is not a Business Day, on the next
following Business Day or (y) within three (3) Business Days after written
demand for payment is made by BHLB, as applicable, following the occurrence
of any of the events set forth below:

  



  

(i) Beacon Federal terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.1.8 or BHLB terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1.7; or

  



  

(ii) The entering into a definitive agreement by Beacon Federal

Acquisition Proposal involving Beacon Federal within one (1) year after the
occurrence of any of the following: (i) the termination of this Agreement by
BHLB pursuant to Section 10.1.2 or 10.1.3 because of a breach by Beacon
Federal or any Beacon Federal Subsidiary after the occurrence of a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or otherwise made known to
the senior management or board of directors of Beacon Federal; or (ii) the
termination of this Agreement by BHLB or Beacon Federal pursuant to Section
10.1.5 because of the failure of the shareholders of Beacon Federal to

occurrence of an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or otherwise
made known to the shareholders of Beacon Federal.

  



  

(D) Beacon Federal and BHLB acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this Section 10.2.2 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither
party would enter into this Agreement. The amounts payable by Beacon Federal
and BHLB pursuant to this Section 10.2.2 constitute liquidated damages and not
a penalty and shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of such party
in the event of termination of this Agreement on the bases specified in such
section.

  



  

10.3 Amendment, Extension and Waiver.

  



  

Subject to applicable law, at any time prior to the Effective Time (whether
before or after approval thereof by the shareholders of Beacon Federal), the
parties hereto by action of their respective Boards of Directors, may (a)
amend this Agreement, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of any other party hereto, (c) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, or (d) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein; provided, however, that after any
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the
shareholders of Beacon Federal, there may not be, without further approval of
such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement which decreases the amount
or value, or changes the form of, the Merger Consideration to be delivered to
Beacon Federal's shareholders pursuant to this Agreement. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
the parties hereto. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party, but such waiver or failure to insist
on strict compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this Article X may only be effected upon a vote of a majority of the entire
Board of Directors of the terminating party.

11.5 Parties in Interest.

  



  

This Agreement and the Voting Agreements shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto or thereto and their
respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that neither this
Agreement and the Voting Agreements nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder or thereunder shall be assigned by any party hereto
without the prior written consent of the other party. Except for Section
7.6.7, 7.6.8, 7.6.9 and 7.7 hereof nothing in this Agreement is intended to
confer upon any Person or entity other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

This Agreement, including the Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules hereto and
the documents and other writings referred to herein or therein or
delivered pursuant hereto, and the Confidentiality Agreements, contains the
entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to its subject
matter. There are no restrictions, agreements, promises, warranties, covenants
or undertakings between the parties other than those expressly set forth
herein or therein. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements
and understandings (other than the Confidentiality Agreements) between the
parties, both written and oral, with respect to its subject matter.

  



  

11.7 Counterparts.

  



  

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts all of which shall

use their reasonable efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable
provision which, insofar as practical, implements the purposes and intents of
this Agreement.

11.10 Interpretation.

  



  

When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections or Exhibits,
such reference shall be to an Article or Section of or Exhibit to this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The recitals hereto constitute an
integral part of this Agreement. References to sections include subsections,
which are part of the related Section (e.g., a section numbered "Section
5.5.1" would be part of "Section 5.5" and references to "Section 5.5" would
also refer to material contained in the subsection described as "Section
5.5.1"). The table of contents, index and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include",
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation". The phrases "the date of this
Agreement", "the date hereof" and terms of similar import, unless the context
otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the
Preamble to this Agreement. The parties have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of
proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

11.11 Specific Performance.

  



  

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that the provisions contained in this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, without the posting of bond or other security, to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each party agrees that it will not seek and will
agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of a bond in
connection with the other party's seeking or obtaining such relief.

  



  

11.12 Waiver of Trial by Jury.

  



  

The parties hereto hereby knowingly, voluntarily and intentionally waive the
right any may have to a trial by jury in respect to any litigation based
hereon, or rising out of, under, or in connection with this Agreement and any
agreement contemplated to be executed in connection herewith, or any
course of conduct, course of dealing, statements (whether verbal or written)
or actions of either party in connection with such agreements.
