 WHEREAS, the parties intend that, for federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall be treated as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Section 368 of the Code; and   

 WHEREAS, Parent, MergerCo and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger, and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound, Parent, MergerCo and the Company hereby agree as follows:   

ARTICLE I    

THE MERGER

 1.2 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.    

 (a) The certificate of incorporation of MergerCo, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by law.

ARTICLE II    

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
 OF THE CONSTITUENT COMPANIES    

 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of capital stock of the Company or any shares of capital stock of MergerCo:    

 (a) Each common share of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall be unchanged by the Merger.    

 (b) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of MergerCo issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be issued and outstanding and shall constitute the only issued and outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation.    

 (c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") that is owned by the Company, by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or by Parent, MergerCo or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.    

 (d) Subject to Sections 2.3 and 2.6, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(c)) shall automatically be converted into, and shall be cancelled in exchange for, the right to receive, at the option of the holder, as contemplated by Section 2.3, either:    

 (i) .6687 (as it may be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.1(f) or increased pursuant to Section 8.1(f) the "Exchange Ratio") of a Parent Common Share (the "Share Consideration"); or    

 (ii) an amount in cash equal to $31.20, without interest (the "Cash Consideration").    

 (e) The Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration and any cash payable in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares pursuant to Section 2.6 are referred to collectively as the "Merger Consideration." All shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(d) shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented    ##### 

  

   

such shares of Company Common Stock (a "Certificate") shall thereafter cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be issued in
consideration therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which
holders of shares of Company Common Stock become entitled in accordance with
this Article II upon the surrender of such Certificate.    

 (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Parent Common Shares or Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, the Exchange Ratio, the Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly, without duplication, to provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.   

 2.2 Optional Termination. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.1, the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and under the circumstances set forth in Section 8.1(f) hereof, unless Parent elects, at its option, to increase the Exchange Ratio as described in such Section 8.1(f) in which case the term "Share Consideration" shall for all purposes under this Agreement thereafter mean such increased number of Parent Common Shares.   

 2.3 Election Procedure.    

 (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent shall designate American Stock Transfer and Trust Company or another agent reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company to act as agent (the "Exchange Agent") for purposes of conducting the election procedure described in this Section 2.3 and the exchange procedure described in Section 2.4.    

 (b) Parent shall prepare a form of election, which form shall be subject to the reasonable approval of the Company (the "Election Form") and shall contain a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates therefore representing shares of Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent), for mailing with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.    

 (c) The Election Form shall be mailed with the Joint Proxy Statement/ Prospectus to the record holders of shares of Company Common Stock as of the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company shall also use its reasonable efforts to make the Election Form and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus available to all Persons who become holders of shares of Company Common Stock during the period between such record date and the Election Deadline.    

 (d) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or in the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and documentation):    

 (i) to elect to receive the Share Consideration for one or more shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder (the "Share Election Shares");    ##### 

  

   

 (ii) to elect to receive the Cash Consideration for one or more shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder (the "Cash Election Shares"); and    

 (iii) to indicate that such holder makes no such election with respect to one or more shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder (the "Non-Election Shares").    

 (e) Nominee record holders who hold shares of Company Common Stock on behalf of multiple beneficial owners shall indicate how many of the shares of Company Common Stock held by the nominee will be Share Election Shares, Cash Election Shares or Non-Election Shares, respectively.    

 (f) If a holder of shares of Company Common Stock either (i) does not submit a properly completed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline or (ii) revokes an Election Form prior to the Election Deadline and does not resubmit a properly completed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such stockholder shall be treated as Non-Election Shares.    

 (g) Any election to receive the Share Consideration or the Cash Consideration shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election Deadline. An Election Form will be properly completed only if accompanied by Certificates duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company (or accompanied by an appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, provided such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent within three (3) NYSE trading days after the date of execution of such guarantee of delivery) representing all shares of Company Common Stock covered thereby. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person submitting such Election Form to the Exchange Agent by written notice to the Exchange Agent only if such written notice is actually received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In addition, all Election Forms shall be deemed to be automatically revoked if this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VIII. Any Certificate or Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock relating to any revoked Election Form shall be promptly returned without charge to the Person submitting the Election Form to the Exchange Agent.    

 (h) The Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine when any election, modification or revocation is received and whether any such election, modification or revocation has been properly made and to disregard immaterial defects in any Election Form, and any good faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither Parent, MergerCo, the Company nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form.    

 (i) By the later of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) seven (7) days after the Election Deadline, the Exchange Agent shall effect an allocation of the Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration in accordance with the Election Forms as follows:    ##### 

  

   

 (i) If the number of Cash Election Shares times the Cash Consideration is less than the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then:    

 (A) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration;    

 (B) Non-Election Shares shall be deemed to be Cash Election Shares to the extent necessary to have the total number of Cash Election Shares times the Cash Consideration equal the Aggregate Cash Consideration. If less than all of the Non-Election Shares need to be treated as Cash Election Shares, in order to have the total number of Cash Election Shares times the Cash Consideration equal the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then the Exchange Agent shall select which Non-Election Shares shall be treated as Cash Election Shares in accordance with Section 2.3(j), and all remaining Non-Election Shares shall thereafter be treated as Share Election Shares;    

 (C) if all of the Non-Election Shares are treated as Cash Election Shares under the preceding subsection, and the total number of Cash Election Shares (including any Non-Election Shares treated as such) times the Cash Consideration remains less than the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then the Exchange Agent shall convert (on a pro rata basis as described in Section 2.3(j) below) a sufficient number of Share Election Shares into Cash Election Shares ("Reallocated Cash Shares") such that the sum of the number of Cash Election Shares (including any Non-Election Shares treated as such) plus the number of Reallocated Cash Shares times the Cash Consideration equals the Aggregate Cash Consideration, and all Reallocated Cash Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; and    

 (D) the Share Election Shares which are not Reallocated Cash Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration.    

 (ii) If the number of Cash Election Shares times the Cash Consideration is greater than the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then:    

 (A) all Share Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration;    

 (B) the Exchange Agent shall convert (on a pro rata basis as described in Section 2.3(j) below) a sufficient number of Cash Election Shares ("Reallocated Stock Shares") such that the number of remaining Cash Election Shares times the Cash Consideration equals the Aggregate Cash Consideration, and all Reallocated Stock Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration; and    

 (C) the Cash Election Shares which are not Reallocated Stock Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.    ##### 

  

   

 (iii) If the number of Cash Election Shares times the Cash Consideration is equal to the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then Sections 2.3(i)(i) and 2.3(i)(ii) above shall not apply and all Non-Election Shares and all Share Election Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration.    

 (j) In the event that the Exchange Agent is required pursuant to Section 2.3(i)(i)(C) to convert some Share Election Shares into Reallocated Cash Shares, each holder of Share Election Shares shall be allocated a pro rata portion of the total Reallocated Cash Shares. In the event the Exchange Agent is required pursuant to Section 2.3(i)(ii)(B) to convert some Cash Election Shares into Reallocated Stock Shares, each holder of Cash Election Shares shall be allocated a pro rata portion of the total Reallocated Stock Shares. In the event the Exchange Agent is required pursuant to Section 2.3(i)(i)(B) or Section 2.3(i)(ii)(A) to convert some Non-Election Shares into Cash Election Shares or Share Election Shares, as the case may be, such conversion shall be allocated on a pro rata basis among Non-Election Shares.   

 2.4 Exchange Procedure.    

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent (i) certificates representing Parent Common Shares sufficient to deliver the aggregate Share Consideration and (ii) the Aggregate Cash Consideration payable pursuant to this Article II in exchange for Certificates representing Cash Election Shares. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the Parent Common Shares held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares for the account of the Persons entitled thereto.    

 (b) After completion of the allocation referred to in Section 2.3(i), each holder of an outstanding Certificate or Certificates who has surrendered such Certificate or Certificates to the Exchange Agent will, upon acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive (i) a certificate or certificates representing the number of whole Parent Common Shares into which the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Certificates surrendered shall have been converted into Share Election Shares pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) the amount of cash into which the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Certificates surrendered shall have been converted into Cash Election Shares pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) the right to receive any other distribution paid with respect to shares of Company Common Stock prior to the Effective Time, in each case without interest. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. Each outstanding Certificate that prior to the Effective Time represented Company Common Stock and which is not surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the procedures provided for herein shall, except as otherwise herein provided, until duly surrendered to the Exchange Agent, be deemed to evidence the right to receive the Share Consideration or the right to receive the Cash Consideration into    ##### 

  

   

which such Company Common Stock shall have been converted. After the
Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of the
Company of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock and if
such Certificates are presented to the Company for transfer, they shall be
cancelled against delivery of certificates for the Share Consideration or the
Cash Consideration or both, as hereinabove provided. No dividends on Parent
Common Shares that have been declared will be remitted to any Person entitled
to receive Parent Common Shares under this Agreement until such Person
surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing Company Common Stock,
at which time such dividends shall be remitted to such Person, without
interest.    

 (c) Appropriate transmittal materials in a form satisfactory to Parent and the Company (including a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of such certificate to the Exchange Agent) shall be mailed as soon as practicable after the Effective Time to each holder of record of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time who did not previously submit a properly completed Election Form. Parent shall not be obligated to deliver cash and/or a certificate or certificates representing Parent Common Shares to which a holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock for exchange as provided in this Section 2.4, or, in default thereof, an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond as may be required by Parent or the Exchange Agent. If any certificates evidencing Parent Common Shares are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate evidencing Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the Certificate and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other tax required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for Parent Common Shares in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.    

 (d) Any portion of the Share Consideration or Cash Consideration delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to Section 2.4(a) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for one year after the Effective Time (as well as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Parent. Any stockholders of Company who have not theretofore complied with Sections 2.3(b) or 2.4(c) shall thereafter look only to Parent for the consideration deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of stock represented by any Certificate for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of the Company to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto.    ##### 

  

   

 (e) Parent and/or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts, if any, as are required to be deducted or withheld under any provision of U.S. federal tax law, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. Amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.   

 2.5 Rights as Stockholders; Stock Transfers. At the Effective Time, holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of the Company other than to receive the Merger Consideration provided under this Article II. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock.   

 2.6 No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for a fractional Parent Common Shares shall be issued in the Merger. Each holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a Parent Common Share (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying (x) the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by (y) the average closing price of a Parent Common Share on the NYSE on the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time (as reported in the _Wall Street Journal_ , or if not reported therein, in another authoritative source), rounded to the nearest whole cent. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share.   

 2.7 Company Stock Options and Related Matters.    

 (a) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock ("Company Option") under any employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company (the "Company Stock Option Plans") whether or not exercisable at the Effective Time and regardless of the exercise price thereof, will be cancelled, effective as of the Effective Time, in exchange for the right to receive at the Effective Time a single lump sum cash payment, equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if any, of the Option Payment over the exercise price per share of such Company Option; provided that if the exercise price per share of any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Option Payment, such Company Option shall be canceled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. All payments under this Section 2.7(a) shall be subject to any applicable withholding tax. For purposes of this Section 2.7, the "Option Payment" shall mean the sum of (x) $13.8057 plus (y) the product of the Average Parent Common Share Price times the Exchange Ratio times the quotient of (A) the Share Election Shares (after giving effect to any reallocation pursuant to Section 2.3) multiplied by the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Average Parent Common Share Price (the "Aggregate Share Consideration Value"), divided by (B) the sum of the Aggregate Cash Consideration plus the Aggregate Share Consideration Value; provided that any adjustment to the Exchange    ##### 

  

   

Ratio pursuant to Section 8.1 (f) or otherwise and any reallocation of the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.3 shall be taken
into account.    

 (b) Parent and MergerCo acknowledge that all restricted stock awards granted under the Company Stock Option Plans shall vest in full immediately prior to the Effective Time so as to no longer be subject to any forfeiture or vesting requirements and all such shares of Company Common Stock shall be considered outstanding shares for all purposes of this Agreement, including receipt of the Merger Consideration.    

 (c) The Company shall take all actions necessary to assure that (i) all outstanding rights under the Companys 1996 Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company ESPP") will be exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time on a final purchase date under such plan determined in accordance with such plan and (ii) the Company ESPP will terminate concurrently with such exercise of the outstanding rights thereunder. All such shares of Company Common Stock issued under the Company ESPP upon such exercise shall be considered outstanding shares for all purposes of this Agreement, including receipt of the Merger Consideration.    

 (d) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, take all actions necessary to suspend or terminate the Companys Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company DRIP"), and thereafter will not issue any shares of Company Common Stock under the Company DRIP.    

 (e) Parent and MergerCo acknowledge that all stock awards granted pursuant to those certain performance based stock award agreements as forth in Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule will no longer be subject to any forfeiture or vesting requirements and all such shares of Company Common Stock shall be considered outstanding shares for all purposes of this Agreement, including receipt of the Merger Consideration.

In the event that the Company Board makes such determination, the Company may enter into a definitive agreement to effect a Superior Proposal, but not prior to forty-eight (48) hours after the Company has provided Parent with written notice (A) advising Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal and that the Company has elected    #####

It is understood and agreed that the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the full extent permitted by applicable law, each Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time), (A) the Company, and the Surviving Corporation and Parent after the Effective Time, shall promptly pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by law, (B) the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and the Company, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties within thirty (30) days after statements therefor are received, and (C) the Company, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will use their respective reasonable best efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter; provided, however, that none of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and provided further that the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and non-appealable, that indemnification by such    ##### 

  

   

entities of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under this Section 6.6, upon learning of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify

 (d) The obligations under this Section 6.6 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this Section 6.6 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnities to whom this Section 6.6 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.6 and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein).    

 (e) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.    #####

The Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public statement as may be required by law or the applicable rules of any stock exchange or quotation system if the party issuing such press release or making such public statement has used its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain such partys consent but has been unable to do so in a timely manner.

 (a) by the mutual written consent of Parent, MergerCo and the Company;    

 (b) by either of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or MergerCo, on the other hand, by written notice to the other:    

 (i) if, upon a vote at a duly held meeting (or at any adjournment or postponement thereof), or action pursuant to written consent, to obtain the Company Equityholder Approval, the Company Equityholder Approval is not obtained;    

 (ii) if, upon a vote at a duly held meeting (or at any adjournment or postponement thereof) to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval, the Parent Shareholder Approval is not obtained;    

 (iii) if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an injunction or taken any other action (which injunction or other action the parties hereto shall use their best efforts to lift), which permanently restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Merger, and such injunction shall have become final and non-appealable; or    

 (iv) if the consummation of the Merger shall not have occurred on or before March 31, 2005 (the "Drop Dead Date"); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(iv) shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date.    

 (c) by written notice from Parent to the Company, if the Company breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b) and such condition is incapable of being satisfied by the Drop Dead Date;    

 (d) by written notice from the Company to Parent if (i) Parent or MergerCo breaches or fails to perform in any material respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) and such condition is incapable of being satisfied by the Drop Dead Date or (ii) as of the date that the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first mailed to the stockholders of the Company through the period ending on the Closing Date, the representation and warranty set forth in    ##### 

  

   

Section 4.21 hereof is not true and correct or the condition set forth in
Section 7.3(e) is not satisfied;    

 (e) by written notice from the Company to Parent, in connection with entering into a definitive agreement to effect a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 6.5; provided, however, that (i) prior to terminating this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e), the Company shall have provided Parent with at least forty-eight (48) hours prior written notice of the Companys decision to so terminate, (ii) such termination shall not be effective until such time as the payment of the Break-up Fee shall have been made by the Company and (iii) the Companys right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e) shall not be available if the Company is then in material breach of Section 6.5. Such notice shall indicate in reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, including the amount and form of the proposed consideration and whether such Superior Proposal is subject to any material conditions; or

In the event the Company serves the notice provided for in (B) above, and the Parent does not agree to increase the Exchange Ratio in accordance with (C) above, then the termination shall become effective at 12:01 a.m. on the following Business Day. The "Average Parent Common Share Price" shall be determined by obtaining the closing prices per share of Parent Common Share on the NYSE (as reported by the _Wall Street Journal_ or, if not reported thereby, another authoritative source), for the fourteen (14) consecutive NYSE trading days ending on the Business Day immediately prior to the Determination Date, discarding the two highest and the two lowest closing prices, and averaging the remaining closing prices. The "Base Share Price" shall be equal to $39.31; provided, however, that the Base Share Price, and the other calculations provided for in this Section 8.2(f) shall be appropriately adjusted if, after the date of this Agreement and on or prior to the Closing Date, the outstanding Parent Common Shares shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, share split, reverse share split, combination or exchange of shares, or any dividend payable in Parent Common Share shall be declared thereon with a record date within such period, or any similar event shall occur. The "Expected Closing Date" shall be the date mutually agreed upon by the Company and Parent for holding the Closing or, in the absence of such mutual agreement, the later of (x) January 4, 2005 and (y) the Business Day immediately following the obtaining of the Company Equityholder Approval and the Parent Shareholder Approval; or    ##### 

  

   

 (g) by written notice of Parent or MergerCo, if the Company Board shall (A) fail to include a recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B) withdraw, modify or change, or propose or announce any intention to withdraw, modify or change, in a manner material and adverse to Parent or MergerCo, such recommendation, or (C) approve or recommend, or announce any intention to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal.   

 8.2 Effect of Termination.    

 (a) Subject to Section 8.2(b), in the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and have no effect, without any liability on the part of Parent, MergerCo or the Company and their respective directors, officers, employees, partners or stockholders and all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall cease, except for the agreements contained in Section 6.4, the last sentence of Section 6.7, Section 6.8, this Section 8.2 and Article IX; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Section 8.2(a) shall relieve any party from liabilities or damages arising out of any fraud or willful breach by such party of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement.    

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e), or by Parent or MergerCo pursuant to Section 8.1(g), then the Company shall pay to Parent, subject to the provisions of Section 8.3(a), an amount in cash equal to $50,000,000 (the "Break-up Fee"). Payment of the Break-up Fee required by this Section 8.2(b) shall be payable by the Company to Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds (i) in the case of termination of this Agreement by the Company under Section 8.1(e) promptly after the date of consummation of such Acquisition Proposal or (ii) in the case of termination of this Agreement by Parent or MergerCo under Section 8.1(g), within three (3) Business Days after the date of termination.    

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent and MergerCo hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(g) in circumstances where the Break-up Fee is payable in accordance with Section 8.2(b), the payment of the Break-up Fee shall constitute liquidated damages with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim which Parent or MergerCo would otherwise be entitled to assert against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets, or against any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members or stockholders, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy available to Parent and MergerCo. The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, in light of the difficulty of accurately determining actual damages with respect to the foregoing upon any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(g) in circumstances where the Break-up Fee is payable in accordance with Section 8.2(b), the rights to payment under Section 8.2(b): (i) constitute a reasonable estimate of the damages that will be suffered by reason of any such proposed or actual termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(g) and (ii) shall be in full and    ##### 

  

   

complete satisfaction of any and all damages arising as a result of the
foregoing. Except for nonpayment of the amounts set forth in Section 8.2(b),
Parent and MergerCo hereby agree that, upon any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(g) in circumstances where the
Break-up Fee is payable in accordance with Section 8.2(b), in no event shall
Parent or MergerCo (i) seek to obtain any recovery or judgment against the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets,
or against any of their respective directors, officers, employees, partners,
managers, members or stockholders, or (ii) be entitled to seek or obtain any
other damages of any kind, including, without limitation, consequential,
indirect or punitive damages.    

 (d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 8.2(b) are an integral part of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the Break-up Fee, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a final adjudication on the merits against the Company for the Break-up Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent interest on the Break-up Fee from and including the date payment of the Break-up Fee was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate of Bank of America, National Association in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.   

 8.3 Payment of Amount or Expense.    

 (a) In the event that the Company is obligated to pay Parent the Break-up Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or the Company or Parent is obligated to pay the other the expenses set forth in Section 6.4(c)(collectively, the "Section 8.2 Amount"), the Company or Parent (the "Payor") shall pay to the other party (the "Payee") from the applicable Section 8.2 Amount deposited into escrow in accordance with the next sentence, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Section 8.2 Amount and (ii) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Payee without causing the Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A) (H) or 856(c)(3)(A) (I) of the Code ("Qualifying Income"), as determined by the Payees independent certified public accountants, plus (2) in the event the Payee receives either (X) a letter from the Payees counsel indicating that the Payee has received a ruling from the IRS described in Section 8.3(b)(ii) or (B) an opinion from the Payees outside counsel as described in Section 8.3(b)(ii), an amount equal to the Section 8.2 Amount less the amount payable under clause (1) above. To secure the Payors obligation to pay these amounts, the Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the Section 8.2 Amount with an escrow agent selected by the Payor and on such terms (subject to Section 8.3(b)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Section 8.2 Amount pursuant to this Section 8.3(a) shall be made at the time the Payor is obligated to pay the Payee the such amount pursuant to Section 6.4(c) or Section 8.2(b), as applicable, by wire transfer or bank check.    

 (b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Section 8.2 Amount in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Payee unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from the Payees    ##### 

  

   

independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that
can be paid by the escrow agent to the Payee without causing the Payee to
fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying
Income or a subsequent letter from the Payees accountants revising that
amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the
Payee, or (ii) a letter from the Payees counsel indicating that the Payee
received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Payee of the
Section 8.2 Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code (or alternatively, the Payees outside counsel has rendered a
legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Payee of the Section 8.2
Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from
gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code),
in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the
Section 8.2 Amount to the Payee. The Payor agrees to amend this Section 8.3
at the request of the Payee in order to (x) maximize the portion of
the Section 8.2 Amount that may be distributed to the Payee hereunder
without causing the Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections
856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the Payees chances of securing
a favorable ruling described in this Section 8.3(b) or (z) assist Parent
in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as
described in this Section 8.3(b). The escrow agreement shall also provide
that any portion of the Section 8.2 Amount held in escrow for five years
shall be released by the escrow agent to the Payor. The Payor shall not be
a party to such escrow agreement and shall not bear any cost of or
have liability resulting from the escrow agreement.   

 8.4 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto at any time before or after any approval hereof by the stockholders of the Company and the shareholders of Parent; provided, however, that after any such stockholder or shareholder approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such stockholders or shareholders without obtaining such approval.   

 8.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of the party against which such waiver or extension is to be enforced. The failure of a party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.
