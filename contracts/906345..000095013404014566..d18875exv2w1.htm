<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the &#147;Agreement&#148;), dated as of October
4, 2004, is made by and among Camden Property Trust, a Texas real estate

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
capital stock of the Company or any shares of capital stock of MergerCo:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Each common share of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per
share, of Parent (&#147;Parent Common Shares&#148;) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
outstanding and shall be unchanged by the Merger.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
MergerCo issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall continue to be issued and outstanding and shall constitute the only
issued and outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (&#147;Company Common Stock&#148;) that is owned by the Company, by any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or by Parent, MergerCo or any
other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Subject to Sections&nbsp;2.3 and 2.6, each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.1(c))
shall automatically be converted into, and shall be cancelled in exchange
for, the right to receive, at the option of the holder, as contemplated

become entitled in accordance with this Article&nbsp;II upon the surrender of
such Certificate.

between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding Parent Common Shares or Company Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason
of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination,
exchange of shares or readjustment, the Exchange Ratio, the Share
Consideration and the Cash Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly,
without duplication, to provide the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 Optional Termination. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section&nbsp;2.1,
the Company shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to and
under the circumstances set forth in Section&nbsp;8.1(f) hereof, unless Parent
elects, at its option, to increase the Exchange Ratio as described in such
Section&nbsp;8.1(f) in which case the term &#147;Share Consideration&#148; shall for all
purposes under this Agreement thereafter mean such increased number of Parent
Common Shares.

<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Parent shall designate American Stock Transfer &#038; Trust Company or another
agent reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company to act as agent
(the &#147;Exchange Agent&#148;) for purposes of conducting the election procedure
described in this Section&nbsp;2.3 and the exchange procedure described in
Section&nbsp;2.4.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Parent shall prepare a form of election, which form shall be
subject to the reasonable approval of the Company (the &#147;Election Form&#148;)
and shall contain a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates therefore representing shares of Company Common Stock shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent), for mailing with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) The Election Form shall be mailed with the Joint Proxy
Statement/ Prospectus to the record holders of shares of Company Common
Stock as of the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting. The
Company shall also use its reasonable efforts to make the Election Form
and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus available to all Persons who
become holders of shares of Company Common Stock during the period
between such record date and the Election Deadline.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or in the case of
nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions
and documentation):



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) to elect to receive the Share Consideration for one or
more shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder (the &#147;Share

<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) to elect to receive the Cash Consideration for one or
more shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder (the &#147;Cash
Election Shares&#148;); and



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) to indicate that such holder makes no such election with
respect to one or more shares of Company Common Stock held by such
holder (the &#147;Non-Election Shares&#148;).



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) Nominee record holders who hold shares of Company Common Stock
on behalf of multiple beneficial owners shall indicate how many of the
shares of Company Common Stock held by the nominee will be Share Election
Shares, Cash Election Shares or Non-Election Shares, respectively.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) If a holder of shares of Company Common Stock either (i)&nbsp;does
not submit a properly completed Election Form prior to the Election
Deadline or (ii)&nbsp;revokes an Election Form prior to the Election Deadline
and does not resubmit a properly completed Election Form prior to the
Election Deadline, the shares of Company Common Stock held by such
stockholder shall be treated as Non-Election Shares.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) Any election to receive the Share Consideration or the Cash
Consideration shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. An Election Form will be properly completed only if
accompanied by Certificates duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form
acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company (or accompanied by an
appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, provided such
Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent within three (3)
NYSE trading days after the date of execution of such guarantee of
delivery) representing all shares of Company Common Stock covered
thereby. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person
submitting such Election Form to the Exchange Agent by written notice to
the Exchange Agent only if such written notice is actually received by
the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In addition, all
Election Forms shall be deemed to be automatically revoked if this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article&nbsp;VIII. Any Certificate
or Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock relating to
any revoked Election Form shall be promptly returned without charge to
the Person submitting the Election Form to the Exchange Agent.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) The Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine
when any election, modification or revocation is received and whether any
such election, modification or revocation has been properly made and to
disregard immaterial defects in any Election Form, and any good faith
decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding
and conclusive. Neither Parent, MergerCo, the Company nor the Exchange

Certificates, Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent (i)&nbsp;certificates
representing Parent Common Shares sufficient to deliver the aggregate
Share Consideration and (ii)&nbsp;the Aggregate Cash Consideration payable
pursuant to this Article&nbsp;II in exchange for Certificates representing
Cash Election Shares. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote
or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the Parent Common
Shares held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall
receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed
with respect to such shares for the account of the Persons entitled
thereto.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) After completion of the allocation referred to in Section
2.3(i), each holder of an outstanding Certificate or Certificates who has
surrendered such Certificate or Certificates to the Exchange Agent will,
upon acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive (i)
a certificate or certificates representing the number of whole Parent
Common Shares into which the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Certificates
surrendered shall have been converted into Share Election Shares pursuant
to this Agreement, (ii)&nbsp;the amount of cash into which the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificate or Certificates surrendered shall have been converted into
Cash Election Shares pursuant to this Agreement and (iii)&nbsp;the right to
receive any other distribution paid with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock prior to the Effective Time, in each case without interest.
The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with
such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices. Each outstanding Certificate that prior to the Effective Time
represented Company Common Stock and which is not surrendered to the
Exchange Agent in accordance with the procedures provided for herein
shall, except as otherwise herein provided, until duly surrendered to the
Exchange Agent, be deemed to evidence the right to receive the Share
Consideration or the right to receive the Cash Consideration into

the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of
the Company of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock
and if such Certificates are presented to the Company for transfer, they
shall be cancelled against delivery of certificates for the Share
Consideration or the Cash Consideration or both, as hereinabove provided.
No dividends on Parent Common Shares that have been declared will be
remitted to any Person entitled to receive Parent Common Shares under
this Agreement until such Person surrenders the Certificate or
Certificates representing Company Common Stock, at which time such
dividends shall be remitted to such Person, without interest.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Appropriate transmittal materials in a form satisfactory to
Parent and the Company (including a letter of transmittal specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such
certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of such certificate to the
Exchange Agent) shall be mailed as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time to each holder of record of Company Common Stock as of the
Effective Time who did not previously submit a properly completed
Election Form. Parent shall not be obligated to deliver cash and/or a
certificate or certificates representing Parent Common Shares to which a
holder of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled as a result of
the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates
representing the shares of Company Common Stock for exchange as provided
in this Section&nbsp;2.4, or, in default thereof, an appropriate affidavit of
loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond as may be required by Parent
or the Exchange Agent. If any certificates evidencing Parent Common
Shares are to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate evidencing Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof
that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the
Certificate and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
tax required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for Parent Common
Shares in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.4(a) that

the Effective Time (as well as any proceeds from any investment thereof)
shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Parent. Any stockholders of
Company who have not theretofore complied with Sections&nbsp;2.3(b) or 2.4(c)
shall thereafter look only to Parent for the consideration deliverable in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as
determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon.
Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be
liable to any holder of stock represented by any Certificate for any
consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of the Company to
establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be
conclusive with respect thereto.

shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock.

otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a Parent Common Share
(after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall
receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined by
multiplying (x)&nbsp;the fractional share interest to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled by (y)&nbsp;the average closing price of a Parent Common Share

excess, if any, of the Option Payment over the exercise price per share
of such Company Option; provided that if the exercise price per share of

in respect thereof. All payments under this Section&nbsp;2.7(a) shall be
subject to any applicable withholding tax. For purposes of this Section
2.7, the &#147;Option Payment&#148; shall mean the sum of (x) $13.8057 plus (y)&nbsp;the
product of the Average Parent Common Share Price times the Exchange Ratio

Schedule, each of the Company and the Partnership has filed all required
forms, and reports with the SEC since January&nbsp;1, 2001 (collectively, the

respects in accordance with the applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act, the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the &#147;Securities Laws&#148;). As of their respective dates, the
Company SEC Reports (a)&nbsp;complied as to form in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Laws and (b)&nbsp;did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated balance sheets
included in or incorporated by reference into the Company SEC Reports
(including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, or the Partnership, as the case may be, as of
its date and each of the consolidated statements of income, retained
earnings and cash flows of the Company or the Partnership, as the case
may be, included in or incorporated by reference into the Company SEC
Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in
all material respects the results of operations, retained earnings or
cash flows, as the case may be, of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, or the Partnership, as the case may be, for the periods set
forth therein, in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied
during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein and except,
in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q
pursuant to Sections&nbsp;13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and normal year-end
audit adjustments which would not be material in amount or effect.
Except for the Partnership, no Company Subsidiary is required to file any
form or report with the SEC. The certificates of the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company or the Partnership, as
the case may be, required by Rules&nbsp;13a-14 and 15d-14 of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company SEC Reports, as applicable, are true and
correct as of the date of this Agreement as they relate to a particular
Company SEC Report, as though made as of the date of this Agreement. The
Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures,
has conducted the procedures in accordance with their terms and has
otherwise operated in compliance with the requirements under Rules&nbsp;13a-15
and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act.

material obligations under this Agreement or (iii)&nbsp;have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

businesses only in the ordinary course of business and there has not been: (a)
any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other distribution
with respect to any shares of capital stock of the Company; (b)&nbsp;any material
commitment, contractual obligation (including, without limitation, any
management or franchise agreement, any lease (capital or otherwise) or any

Company Subsidiaries outside the ordinary course of business except for
Commitments for expenses of attorneys, accountants and investment bankers
incurred in connection with the Merger; or (c)&nbsp;any material change in the
Company&#146;s accounting principles, practices or methods except insofar as may

Tax Returns as required to be paid by it, except, in each case, where the
failure to file such Tax Returns or pay such Taxes would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company (i)&nbsp;for
all taxable years commencing with December&nbsp;31, 1994 through December&nbsp;31, 2003
has been subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust (a &#147;REIT&#148;)
within the meaning of Section&nbsp;856 of the Code and has satisfied all
requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years and (ii)&nbsp;has operated since
December&nbsp;31, 2003 to the date hereof, and intends to continue to operate, in
such a manner as to permit it to continue to qualify as a REIT. Except as set
forth in Section&nbsp;3.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the most recent
financial statements contained in the Company SEC Reports reflect, to the
knowledge of the Company, an adequate reserve for all Taxes payable by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions
thereof through the date of such financial statements in accordance with GAAP,
whether or not shown as being due on any Tax Returns. True, correct and
complete copies of all federal, state and local Tax Returns for the Company and
each Company Subsidiary with respect to the taxable years commencing on or
after January&nbsp;2001 and all written communications with any taxing authority
relating to such Tax Returns requested by Parent, MergerCo or their respective
representatives have been delivered or made available to representatives of
Parent. To the knowledge of the Company, and except as set forth in Section
3.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no deficiencies for any Taxes have
been proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, and no requests for waivers of
the time to assess any such Taxes are pending. The Partnership is and has been
for all prior periods taxable as a partnership and not as an association
taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes. Except as set forth
in Section&nbsp;3.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no Tax Protection
Agreements. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;3.10 &#147;Tax Protection Agreements&#148;
shall mean any agreement to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party pursuant to which (a)&nbsp;any liability to holders of OP Units relating to
Taxes may arise, whether or not as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b)&nbsp;in connection with the
deferral of income Taxes of a holder of OP Units, the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries have agreed to (i)&nbsp;maintain a minimum level of debt or continue a
particular debt, (ii)&nbsp;retain or not dispose of assets for a period of time that
has not since expired, (iii)&nbsp;make or refrain from making Tax elections, (iv)
operate (or refrain from operating) in a particular manner, and/or (v)&nbsp;only

in the aggregate, are not material in amount, do not materially detract from
the value of or materially interfere with the present use of any of the Company
Properties subject thereto or affected thereby, and do not otherwise have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, valid policies of title insurance have

hereof, in full force and effect and no material claim has been made against

Effect; (ii)&nbsp;neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received
written notice of any violation of any federal, state or municipal law,
ordinance, order, regulation or requirement affecting any of the Company
Properties issued by any governmental authority which have not been cured,
contested in good faith or which violations would not, individually, or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (iii)&nbsp;there are no material
structural defects relating to any of the Company Properties, except for any

receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal by such Third Party and of the material terms and

the Company&#146;s approval or recommendation of the Merger, (ii)&nbsp;approve or
recommend an Acquisition Proposal to its stockholders or (iii)&nbsp;cause the

Board makes such determination, the Company may enter into a definitive

<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Subject to Section&nbsp;8.2(b), in the event of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith

part of Parent, MergerCo or the Company and their respective directors,

any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained in this Agreement.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to

Parent and MergerCo hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that, with
respect to any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.1(e)
or Section&nbsp;8.1(g) in circumstances where the Break-up Fee is payable in
accordance with Section&nbsp;8.2(b), the payment of the Break-up Fee shall

assert against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of
their respective assets, or against any of their respective directors,

the foregoing. Except for nonpayment of the amounts set forth in Section
8.2(b), Parent and MergerCo hereby agree that, upon any termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.1(e) or Section&nbsp;8.1(g) in
circumstances where the Break-up Fee is payable in accordance with
Section&nbsp;8.2(b), in no event shall Parent or MergerCo (i)&nbsp;seek to obtain
any recovery or judgment against the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets, or against any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members or

Section&nbsp;8.2(b) are an integral part of the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to
pay the Break-up Fee, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a final adjudication on the merits

escrow an amount in cash equal to the Section&nbsp;8.2 Amount with an escrow
agent selected by the Payor and on such terms (subject to Section&nbsp;8.3(b))
as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow
