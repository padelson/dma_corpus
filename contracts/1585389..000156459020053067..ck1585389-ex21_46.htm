treatment of fractional shares of SmartStop Class A Common Stock in accordance
with Section 3.1(d) (the "Merger Consideration");

 

(ii)All Eligible Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder thereof shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration therefor in accordance with this Agreement;

prior to the Merger Effective Time shall remain outstanding and, collectively,
shall constitute the only issued and outstanding membership interests of the
Surviving Entity.

 

(b)Adjustment of the Merger Consideration. Between the date of this Agreement
and the Merger Effective Time, if the issued and outstanding shares of SST IV
Common Stock, securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
shares of SST IV Common Stock, shares of SmartStop Common Stock or securities

Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or other
securities or a different class by reason of any stock split (whether forward
or reverse), combination, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization,
distribution, merger or exchange or other similar transaction, or a stock
dividend having a record date within such period shall have been declared,
then (without limiting any other rights of the Parties hereunder), the
Exchange Ratio shall be ratably adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
such change, and thereafter all references to the Exchange Ratio shall be
deemed to be the Exchange Ratio as so adjusted. For the avoidance of doubt,
(i) no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this Section

 

15

   

3.1(b) for any shares issued pursuant to SST IV's or SmartStop's distribution
reinvestment plan or redeemed pursuant to SST IV's or SmartStop's share
redemption program and (ii) nothing in this Section 3.1(b) shall be construed
to permit the Parties to take any action except to the extent consistent with,
and not otherwise prohibited by, the terms of this Agreement.

transfer books of SST IV shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no
further registration of transfers of SST IV Common Stock. From and after the

deductible pursuant to and in accordance with Section 3.4 shall include such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld under the Code and any
applicable state or local Tax laws with respect to the lapsing of any
restrictions on SST IV Restricted Share Awards.

employee, officer, director, agent or Affiliate of such entities, shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration (or the
appropriate portion thereof) that has been delivered to a public official

amounts so delivered that remain unclaimed by holders of Eligible Shares
immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat
to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of SmartStop free and clear
of any claims or interest of such holders or their successors, assigns or
personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

amounts in respect thereof, including any dividends payable on shares of
SmartStop Class A Common Stock ) for the benefit of holders of Eligible Shares
or SST IV Restricted Share Awards.

indicated in the notes thereto, or, in the case of the unaudited financial

permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q or any successor form under the Exchange
Act, which such adjustments are not, individually or in the aggregate,
material to SST IV) and (iv) fairly present, or will fairly present, as the

(d)(i) SST IV maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to
ensure that material information required to be disclosed by SST IV in the
reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to SST IV's
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer of SST IV required under the Exchange Act with respect
to such reports, and (ii) such disclosure controls and procedures are
effective in timely alerting SST IV's principal executive officer and
principal financial officer to material information required to be included in
SST IV's periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. SST IV and the SST
IV Subsidiaries have designed and maintained a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) reasonably designed to provide reasonable assurances (A)
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (B) that transactions are
executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations,
(C) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements and to maintain asset accountability, (D) that access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific
authorizations, (E) that the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences and (F) that accounts, notes and other
receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate
procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and
timely basis. SST IV has disclosed to SST IV's auditors and audit committee,
based on the most recent evaluation by its Chief Executive Officer and its
Chief Financial Officer prior to the date of this Agreement, (1) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect SST IV's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (2) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in internal control over financial reporting.

 

(e)SST IV is not, and none of the SST IV Subsidiaries is, a party to, and
neither SST IV nor any SST IV Subsidiary has any commitment to become a party
to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract
or arrangement, including any Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among SST IV and any SST IV Subsidiary, on the one
hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate of SST IV or any SST IV Subsidiary,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or
effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, SST IV, any SST IV Subsidiary or SST
IV's or such SST IV Subsidiary's audited financial statements or other SST IV
SEC Documents.

or to carry on its respective business substantially as they are being
conducted as of the date hereof (the "SST IV Permits"), and all such SST IV
Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except where the failure to be
in possession of, or the failure to be valid or in full force and effect of,
any of the SST IV Permits, individually, or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a SST IV Material Adverse Effect. SST IV has
paid all fees and assessments due and payable, in each case, in connection
with all such Permits, except where failure to pay, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a SST IV Material Adverse
Effect. No event has occurred with respect to any of the SST IV Permits which
permits, or after notice or lapse of time or both would permit, revocation or
termination thereof or would result in any other material impairment of the
rights of the holder of any such SST IV Permits. Neither SST IV nor any of the
SST IV Subsidiaries has received any notice indicating, nor to the Knowledge
of SST IV, is there any pending applicable petition, objection or other
pleading with any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction or authority over
the operations of SST IV or the SST IV Subsidiaries or the SST IV Properties
that impairs the validity of any SST IV Permit or which would reasonably be
expected, if accepted or granted, to result in the revocation of any SST IV
Permit, except where the impairment or revocation of any such SST IV Permits,
individually, or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
SST IV Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b)Since January 1, 2018, neither SST IV nor any SST IV Subsidiary has been in
conflict with, or in default or violation of, (i) any Law applicable to SST IV
or any SST IV Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of SST IV or any
SST IV Subsidiary is bound (except for compliance with Laws addressed in
Section 4.10, Section 4.11, Section 4.13 and Section 4.16 which are solely
addressed in those Sections) or (ii) any SST IV Permits (except for the SST IV
Permits addressed in Section 4.11, which are solely addressed in that
Section), except, in each case, for any such conflicts, defaults or violations
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a SST IV Material Adverse Effect.

 

Litigation

 

. There is no material Action to which SST IV or any SST IV Subsidiary is a
party (either as plaintiff or defendant) pending or, to the Knowledge of SST
IV, threatened before any Governmental Authority and, to the Knowledge of SST
IV, there is no basis for any such Action. Neither SST IV nor any SST IV
Subsidiary has been permanently or temporarily enjoined by any Order from
engaging in or continuing to conduct the business of SST IV or the SST IV
Subsidiaries. No Order has been issued in any proceeding to which SST IV or
any of the SST IV Subsidiaries is or was a party, or, to the Knowledge of SST
IV, in any other proceeding, that enjoins or requires SST IV or any of the SST
IV Subsidiaries to take action of any kind with respect to its businesses,
assets or properties. Since December 31, 2017, none of SST IV, any SST IV
Subsidiary or any Representative of the foregoing has received or made any
settlement offer for any material Action to which SST IV or any SST IV
Subsidiary is a

 

22

   

party or potentially could be a party (in each case, either as plaintiff or
defendant), other than settlement offers that do not exceed $500,000
individually.

received written notice of any uncured violation of any Law (including zoning,

Properties issued by any Governmental Authority; and (iii) except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a SST IV Material Adverse Effect,

SST IV Properties.

 

(b)Except as disclosed in property condition assessments and similar
structural engineering reports relating to the SST IV Properties, SST IV has

prior to the date of this Agreement, except as has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a SST IV
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c)SST IV and the SST IV Subsidiaries have good title to, or a valid and
enforceable leasehold interest in, all material personal property assets
owned, used or held for use by them. Neither SST IV's, nor the SST IV
Subsidiaries', ownership of any such personal property is subject to any
Liens, other than Permitted Liens.

 

Environmental Matters

expected to have a SST IV Material Adverse Effect: (i) no written
notification, demand, request for information, citation, summons or order has
been received, no complaint has been filed, no penalty has been assessed and
no investigation, action, suit or proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge
of SST IV, is threatened relating to SST IV, any of the SST IV Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties, and relating to or arising out of any
Environmental Law or Hazardous Substance; (ii) SST IV and the SST IV
Subsidiaries are and, for the past three (3) years, have been, in compliance

the extent applicable, operate its properties or to carry on its respective
business substantially as they are being conducted as of the date hereof, and
all such Environmental Permits are valid and in full force and effect; and
(iv) there are no liabilities or obligations of SST IV or any of the SST IV
Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute,
determined, determinable or otherwise arising under or relating to any
Environmental Law or any Hazardous Substance and there is no condition,
situation or set of circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result
in any such liability or obligation.

(b)Each Contract in any of the categories set forth in Section 4.12(a) to
which SST IV or any SST IV Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound as of
the date hereof is referred to herein as a "SST IV Material Contract."

 



 

(c)Each SST IV Material Contract is legal, valid, binding and enforceable on
SST IV and/or the SST IV Subsidiary that is a party thereto and, to the
Knowledge of SST IV, each other party thereto, and is in full force and
effect, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law). SST IV and each SST IV
Subsidiary has performed all obligations required to be performed by it prior
to the date hereof under each SST IV Material Contract and, to the Knowledge
of

 

24

   

SST IV, each other party thereto has performed all obligations required to be
performed by it under such SST IV Material Contract prior to the date hereof,

Subsidiary has received any written notice of the intention of any party to
cancel, terminate, materially change the scope of rights under or fail to
renew any SST IV Material Contract.

 



 

Section 4.13Taxes.

 

(a)SST IV and each SST IV Subsidiary has timely filed with the appropriate
Governmental Authority all United States federal income Tax Returns and all
other material Tax Returns required to be filed, taking into account any
extensions of time within which to file such Tax Returns, and all such Tax
Returns were complete and correct in all material respects. SST IV and each
SST IV Subsidiary has duly paid (or there has been paid on their behalf), or
made adequate provisions in accordance with GAAP for, all material Taxes
required to be paid by them, whether or not shown on any Tax Return. No
written claim has been proposed by any Governmental Authority in any
jurisdiction where SST IV or any SST IV Subsidiary do not file Tax Returns
that SST IV or any SST IV Subsidiary is or may be subject to Tax by such
jurisdiction

 

(b)SST IV (i) for all taxable years commencing with SST IV's year ending
December 31, 2017 and through December 31, 2019, has been subject to taxation
as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code and has satisfied all
requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years; (ii) has operated since
January 1, 2020 to the date hereof, in a manner consistent with the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT; (iii) intends to
continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for its taxable
year that will include the day of the Merger; and (iv) has not taken or
omitted to take any action that could reasonably be expected to result in a
challenge by the IRS or any other Governmental Authority to its status as a
REIT, and no such challenge is pending or, to the Knowledge of SST IV,
threatened. SST IV does not own a direct or indirect ownership interest in an
entity that is a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes,
other than a corporation that qualifies as a Qualified REIT Subsidiary or as a
Taxable REIT Subsidiary of SST IV. SST IV's dividends paid deduction, within
the meaning of Section 561 of the Code, for all taxable years commencing with
SST IV's year ending December 31, 2017, taking into account any dividends
subject to Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code, has not been less than the
sum of (A) SST IV's REIT taxable income, as defined in Section 857(b)(2) of
the Code, determined without regard to any dividends paid deduction for such
year and (B) SST IV's net capital gain for such year.

 

(c)(i) There are no audits, investigations by any Governmental Authority or
other proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of SST IV, threatened with
regard to any material Taxes or material Tax Returns of SST IV or any SST IV
Subsidiary; (ii) no material deficiency for Taxes of SST IV or any SST IV
Subsidiary, has been claimed, proposed or assessed in writing or, to the
Knowledge of SST IV, threatened, by any Governmental Authority, which
deficiency has not yet been settled except for such deficiencies which are
being contested in good faith or with respect to which the failure to pay,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
SST IV Material Adverse Effect; (iii) neither SST IV nor any SST IV Subsidiary
has waived any statute of limitations with respect to the assessment of
material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time (other than pursuant to an
automatic extension to file a Tax Return requested in the ordinary course of
business) with respect to any material Tax assessment or deficiency for any
tax year that is not closed under the applicable statute of limitations; (iv)
neither SST IV nor any SST IV Subsidiary is currently the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any material Tax Return (other than
pursuant to an automatic extension to file a Tax Return requested in the
ordinary course of business); and

 

25

   

(v) neither SST IV nor any SST IV Subsidiary has entered into any "closing
agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or
similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law).

 

(d)Each SST IV Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company and that has not elected to be a Taxable REIT Subsidiary has
been since its formation treated for United States federal income tax purposes
as a partnership, disregarded entity, or Qualified REIT Subsidiary, as the
case may be, and not as a corporation (or other entity taxable as a
corporation) whose separate existence is respected for United States federal
income tax purposes, or a "publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of
Section 7704(b) of the Code that is treated as a corporation for United States
federal income tax purposes under Section 7704(a) of the Code.

 

(e)Neither SST IV nor any SST IV Subsidiary holds any asset the disposition of
which would be subject to Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-7, nor have
they disposed of any such asset during its current taxable year.

 

(f)Since its inception, SST IV and the SST IV Subsidiaries have not incurred
(i) any material liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(1), 857(b)(4),
857(b)(6)(A), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, (ii) any liability for Taxes under
Sections 857(b)(5) (for income test violations), 856(c)(7)(C) (for asset test
violations), or 856(g)(5)(C) (for violations of other qualification
requirements applicable to REITs) and (iii) any material liability for Tax
other than (A) in the ordinary course of business, or (B) transfer or similar
Taxes arising in connection with sales of property. No event has occurred,
and to the Knowledge of SST IV no condition or circumstances exists, which
presents a material risk that any material liability for Taxes described
clause (i) or (iii) of the preceding sentence or any liability for Taxes
described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence will be imposed upon SST IV
or any SST IV Subsidiary for any taxable period (or portion thereof) preceding
the Merger.

 

(g)SST IV and the SST IV Subsidiaries have complied, in all material respects,
with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes
(including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446
and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any state and foreign Laws)
and have duly and timely withheld and, in each case, have paid over to the
appropriate taxing authorities all material amounts required to be so withheld
and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof under all applicable Laws.

 

(h)There are no SST IV Tax Protection Agreements (as hereinafter defined) in
force at the date of this Agreement, and, as of the date of this Agreement, no
Person has raised in writing, or to the Knowledge of SST IV threatened to
raise, a material claim against SST IV or any SST IV Subsidiary for any breach
of any SST IV Tax Protection Agreements. As used herein, "SST IV Tax
Protection Agreements" means any written agreement to which SST IV or any SST
IV Subsidiary is a party pursuant to which: (i) any liability of SST IV or any
SST IV Subsidiary to holders of limited partnership interests in a SST IV
Subsidiary Partnership (as hereinafter defined) relating to Taxes may arise,
whether or not as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and/or (ii) in connection with the deferral of
income Taxes of a holder of limited partnership interests or limited liability
company interests in a SST IV Subsidiary Partnership, SST IV or any SST IV
Subsidiary has agreed to (A) maintain a minimum level of debt, continue a
particular debt or provide rights to guarantee debt, (B) retain or not dispose
of assets, (C) make or refrain from making Tax elections, and/or (D) only
dispose of assets in a particular manner. As used herein, "SST IV Subsidiary
Partnership" means a SST IV Subsidiary that is treated as a partnership for
United States federal income tax purposes.

 

(i)There are no Liens for Taxes upon any property or assets of SST IV or any
SST IV Subsidiary except for Permitted Liens.

 

(j)There are no Tax allocation or sharing agreements or similar arrangements
(other than Non-Tax Contracts) with respect to or involving SST IV or any SST
IV Subsidiary, and after the Closing Date, neither SST IV nor any SST IV
Subsidiary shall be bound by any such Tax allocation or sharing agreements or
similar arrangements or have any liability thereunder for amounts due in
respect of periods prior to the Closing Date.

 

(k)Except for property Tax appeals made in the ordinary course of business,
neither SST IV nor any SST IV Subsidiary has requested or received any written
ruling of a Governmental Authority or entered into

 

26

   

any written agreement with a Governmental Authority with respect to any Taxes,
and neither SST IV nor any SST IV Subsidiary is subject to written ruling of a
Governmental Authority.

 

(l)Neither SST IV nor any SST IV Subsidiary (i) has been a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated United States federal income Tax Return
or (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than any SST IV
Subsidiary) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
Contract, or otherwise (other than pursuant to a Non-Tax Contract).

 

(m)Neither SST IV nor any SST IV Subsidiary has participated in any
"reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b).

 

(n)Neither SST IV nor any SST IV Subsidiary has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two (2) years
prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could
otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(o)No written power of attorney that has been granted by SST IV or any SST IV
Subsidiary (other than to SST IV or a SST IV Subsidiary) currently is in force
with respect to any matter relating to Taxes, other than any power of attorney
that will terminate on or before the Closing.

 

(p) To the Knowledge of SST IV, SST IV is a "domestically controlled qualified
investment entity" within the meaning of Section 897(h)(4)(B) of the Code.

third party, (ii) to the Knowledge of SST IV, no Person is misappropriating,
infringing or otherwise violating any Intellectual Property of SST IV or any
SST IV Subsidiary, and (iii) SST IV and the SST IV Subsidiaries own or are

Property necessary to conduct the business of SST IV and the SST IV
Subsidiaries as it is currently conducted. Since January 1, 2018, neither SST
IV nor any SST IV Subsidiary has received any written or, to the Knowledge of
SST IV, verbal complaint, claim or notice alleging misappropriation,
infringement or violation of any Intellectual Property rights of any third
party.

expected to have a SST IV Material Adverse Effect, all premiums due and
payable under all material insurance policies and all material fidelity bonds
or other material insurance Contracts providing coverage for SST IV and the
SST IV Subsidiaries (the "SST IV Insurance Policies") have been paid, and SST
IV and the SST IV Subsidiaries have otherwise complied in all material
respects with the terms and conditions of all SST IV Insurance Policies. No

replaced on substantially similar terms prior to the date of such
cancellation.

financial statements and to maintain asset accountability, (D) that access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or specific
authorizations, (E) that the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences and (F) that accounts, notes and other
receivables and inventory are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate
procedures are implemented to effect the collection thereof on a current and
timely basis. SmartStop has disclosed to SmartStop's auditors and audit

management or other employees who have a significant role in internal control
over financial reporting.

 

(e)SmartStop is not, and none of the SmartStop Subsidiaries is, a party to,
and neither SmartStop nor any SmartStop Subsidiary has any commitment to

any SmartStop Subsidiary, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where

which would reasonably be expected, if accepted or granted, to result in the
revocation of any SmartStop Permit, except

where the impairment or revocation of any such SmartStop Permits,
individually, or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
SmartStop Material Adverse Effect.

case, for any such conflicts, defaults or violations that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a SmartStop Material
Adverse Effect.

SmartStop, threatened before any Governmental Authority and, to the Knowledge

(b)Each Contract in any of the categories set forth in Section 5.12(a) to
which SmartStop or any SmartStop Subsidiary is a party or by which it is bound
as of the date hereof is referred to herein as a "SmartStop Material
Contract."

 

(c)Each SmartStop Material Contract is legal, valid, binding and enforceable
on SmartStop and/or the SmartStop Subsidiary that is a party thereto and, to
the Knowledge of SmartStop, each other party thereto, and is in full force and
effect, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law). SmartStop and each SmartStop
Subsidiary has performed all obligations required to be performed by it prior
to the date hereof under each SmartStop Material Contract and, to the
Knowledge of SmartStop, each other party thereto has performed all obligations
required to be performed by it under such SmartStop Material Contract prior to
the date hereof, except where in each case the failure to perform,

breach or violation of, or default under, any SmartStop Material Contract, and
no event has occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would

Adverse Effect. Since December 31, 2019 and as of the date hereof, neither
SmartStop nor any SmartStop Subsidiary has received any written notice of the
intention of any party to cancel, terminate, materially change the scope of
rights under or fail to renew any SmartStop Material Contract.

 

Section 5.13Taxes.

 

(a)Each SmartStop Party and each other SmartStop Subsidiary has timely filed
with the appropriate Governmental Authority all United States federal income
Tax Returns and all other material Tax Returns required to be filed, taking
into account any extensions of time within which to file such Tax Returns, and
all such Tax Returns were complete and correct in all material respects. Each
SmartStop Party and each other SmartStop Subsidiary has duly paid (or there
has been paid on their behalf), or made adequate provisions in accordance with
GAAP for, all material Taxes required to be paid by them, whether or not shown
on any Tax Return. No written claim has been proposed by any Governmental
Authority in any jurisdiction where SmartStop or any SmartStop Subsidiary do
not file Tax Returns that SmartStop or any SmartStop Subsidiary is or may be
subject to Tax by such jurisdiction.

 

(b)SmartStop (i) for all taxable years commencing with SmartStop's year ending
December 31, 2014 and through December 31, 2019, has been subject to taxation
as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code and has satisfied all
requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years; (ii) has operated since
January 1, 2020 to the date hereof, in a manner consistent with the
requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT; (iii) intends to
continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for its taxable
year that will include the day of the

 

37

   

Merger; and (iv) has not taken or omitted to take any action that could
reasonably be expected to result in a challenge by the IRS or any other
Governmental Authority to its status as a REIT, and no such challenge is
pending or, to the Knowledge of SmartStop, threatened. SmartStop does not own
a direct or indirect ownership interest in an entity that is treated as a
corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, other than a
corporation that qualifies as a Qualified REIT Subsidiary or as a Taxable REIT
Subsidiary of SmartStop. SmartStop's dividends paid deduction, within the
meaning of Section 561 of the Code, for all taxable years commencing with
SmartStop's year ending December 31, 2014, taking into account any dividends
subject to Sections 857(b)(9) or 858 of the Code, has not been less than the
sum of (A) SmartStop's REIT taxable income, as defined in Section 857(b)(2) of
the Code, determined without regard to any dividends paid deduction for such
year and (B) SmartStop's net capital gain for such year.

 

(c)(i) There are no audits, investigations by any Governmental Authority or
other proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of SmartStop, threatened with
regard to any material Taxes or material Tax Returns of SmartStop or any
SmartStop Subsidiary; (ii) no material deficiency for Taxes of SmartStop or
any SmartStop Subsidiary has been claimed, proposed or assessed in writing or,
to the Knowledge of SmartStop, threatened, by any Governmental Authority,
which deficiency has not yet been settled except for such deficiencies which
are being contested in good faith or with respect to which the failure to pay,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
SmartStop Material Adverse Effect; (iii) neither SmartStop nor any SmartStop
Subsidiary has waived any statute of limitations with respect to the
assessment of material Taxes or agreed to any extension of time (other than
pursuant to an automatic extension to file a Tax Return requested in the
ordinary course of business) with respect to any material Tax assessment or
deficiency for any tax year that is not closed under the applicable statute of
limitations; (iv) neither SmartStop nor any SmartStop Subsidiary is currently
the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any material Tax
Return (other than pursuant to an automatic extension to file a Tax Return
requested in the ordinary course of business); and (v) neither SmartStop nor
any SmartStop Subsidiary has entered into any "closing agreement" as described
in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of
state, local or foreign income Tax Law).

 

(d)Each SmartStop Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company and that has not elected to be a Taxable REIT Subsidiary has
been since its formation treated for United States federal income tax purposes
as a partnership, disregarded entity, or Qualified REIT Subsidiary, as the
case may be, and not as a corporation(or other entity taxable as a
corporation) whose separate existence is respected for United States federal
income tax purposes, or a "publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of
Section 7704(b) of the Code that is treated as a corporation for United States
federal income tax purposes under Section 7704(a) of the Code.

 

(e)Neither SmartStop nor any SmartStop Subsidiary holds any asset the
disposition of which would be subject to Treasury Regulation Section
1.337(d)-7, nor have they disposed of any such asset during its current
taxable year.

 

(f)(i) Since its inception, SmartStop and the SmartStop Subsidiaries have not
incurred (i) any material liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(1),
857(b)(4), 857(b)(6)(A), 857(b)(7)(A), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, (ii) any
liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b)(5) (for income test violations),
856(c)(7)(C) (for asset test violations), or 856(g)(5)(C) (for violations of
other qualification requirements applicable to REITs) and (iii) any material
liability for Tax other than (A) in the ordinary course of business, or (B)
transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with sales of property. No
event has occurred, and to the Knowledge of SmartStop no condition or
circumstances exists, which presents a material risk that any material
liability for Taxes described clause (i) or (iii) of the preceding sentence or
any liability for Taxes described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence
will be imposed upon SmartStop or any SmartStop Subsidiary for any taxable
period (or portion thereof) preceding the Merger.

 

(g)SmartStop and the SmartStop Subsidiaries have complied, in all material
respects, with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of
Taxes (including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445,
1446 and 3402 of the Code or similar provisions under any state and foreign
Laws) and have duly and timely withheld and, in each case, have paid over to
the appropriate taxing authorities all material amounts required to be so
withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof under all
applicable Laws.

agreements or similar arrangements or have any liability thereunder for
amounts due in respect of periods prior to the Closing Date.

successor, by Contract, or otherwise (other than pursuant to a Non-Tax
Contract).

 

(m) Neither SmartStop nor any SmartStop Subsidiary has participated in any

(n)Neither SmartStop nor any SmartStop Subsidiary has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock qualifying for
tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (i) in the two (2) years
prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could
otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in conjunction with
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(o)No written power of attorney that has been granted by SmartStop or any

and SmartStop and the SmartStop Subsidiaries have otherwise complied in all
material respects with the terms and conditions of all SmartStop Insurance

capital stock to the other Party and provide such other assistance as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement and shall provide to
their and each other's counsel such representations as reasonably necessary to
render the opinions required to be filed therewith. The Form S-4 and the Proxy
Statement shall include all information reasonably requested by such other
Party to be included therein. Each of SST IV and SmartStop shall promptly
notify the other Party upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement, and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof,

Stockholder Approvals, any information relating to SmartStop or SST IV, or any
of their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by SmartStop or SST IV
which, in the reasonable judgment of SmartStop or SST IV, should be set forth
in an amendment of, or a supplement to, any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, as applicable, in the light of the circumstances under

information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and SmartStop and SST IV

of, or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement and, to the extent
required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to stockholders of SmartStop and SST IV.

 

(c)Subject to SST IV's rights with respect to a Superior Proposal under
Section 7.3, as promptly as practicable after the SEC advises it has no
comments or no further comments to the Proxy Statement or Form S-4, SST IV
shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the SST IV Governing Documents,
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Stockholders Meeting solely for the purpose of obtaining the Stockholder
Approvals; provided, that such record date shall not be more than ninety (90)
days prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting. SST IV shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed
to SST IV's stockholders entitled to vote at the Stockholders Meeting and to

declared effective under the Securities Act (provided that there are no
outstanding SEC comments on the Proxy Statement or Form S-4 and the SEC has
not otherwise enjoined mailing or use of the Proxy Statement). SST IV shall,
through the SST IV Special Committee and the SST IV Board, recommend to its
stockholders that they provide the Stockholder Approvals, include the SST IV
Special Committee and SST IV Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement and
solicit and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Stockholder
Approvals, except to the extent that the SST IV Special Committee and SST IV
Board shall have made an Adverse

 

49

   

Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 7.3(c); provided, however, for
the avoidance of doubt, no Adverse Recommendation Change shall alter the other
obligations under Section 7.1 unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
in accordance with its terms prior to the Stockholders Meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.1(c), SST IV shall
have the right to make one or more postponements, recesses or adjournments of
the Stockholders Meeting (i) if, on a date for which the Stockholders Meeting
is scheduled, SST IV has not received proxies representing a sufficient number
of shares of SST IV Common Stock to obtain the Stockholder Approvals, whether
or not a quorum is present, or (ii) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement required under applicable Law
to be filed with the SEC and/or disseminated to SST IV's stockholders is
timely filed with the SEC and/or disseminated to SST IV's stockholders;
provided, however, that the Stockholders Meeting shall not be postponed or

Law) and in the case of clause (ii), more than ten (10) Business Days from the
previously scheduled date of such meeting, or (B) more than one hundred twenty
(120) days from the record date for the Stockholders Meeting; provided,
further, the Stockholders Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned on the
date the Stockholders Meeting is scheduled if SST IV shall have received
proxies in respect of an aggregate number of shares of SST IV Common Stock,
which have not been withdrawn, such that Stockholder Approvals would be
obtained at such meeting.

Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance notice to all of their respective properties, offices,
books, Contracts, personnel and records that the other Party may reasonably
request and, during such period, each of the Parties shall, and shall cause
each of their respective subsidiaries to and shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives to, furnish reasonably promptly to the

document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
federal or state securities Laws as the other Party may reasonably request. In
connection with such reasonable access to information, each of the Parties
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause its respective
Representatives to participate in meetings and telephone conferences with the
other Parties and their Representatives prior to the mailing of the Proxy
Statement, prior to the Stockholders Meeting, respectively, and at such other
times as may be reasonably requested. No investigation under this Section
7.2(a) or otherwise shall affect any of the representations and warranties of
the Parties contained in this Agreement or any condition to the obligations of
the Parties under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Parties shall be required by this Section 7.2(a) to provide the other Parties
or their respective Representatives with access to or to disclose information
(A) that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third
party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after
the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business in accordance
with this Agreement (provided, however, that the withholding Party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts (without payment of any consideration,
fees or expenses) to obtain the required consent of such third party to such
access or disclosure), (B) of a sensitive or personal nature that would
reasonably be expected to expose SST IV or SmartStop to the risk of liability,
(C) the disclosure of which would violate any Law applicable to such Party or
any of its Representatives (provided, however, that the withholding Party
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute
arrangements to permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of any Law or
duty), (D) that is subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or
other legal privilege (provided, however, that the withholding Party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to
the maximum extent that does not result in a loss of any such attorney-client,
attorney work product or other legal privilege, including by means of entry
into a customary joint defense agreement that would alleviate the loss of such
privilege) or (E) for the purpose of allowing Parties or their respective
Representatives to collect samples of soil, air, water, groundwater or
building materials. The Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to
minimize any disruption to the businesses of the other Parties and any of
their respective subsidiaries that may result from the requests for access,
data and information hereunder. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, each Party
shall not, and shall cause its respective Representatives and Affiliates not
to, except in the ordinary course of business, contact or otherwise
communicate with third parties with which the other Party or any of its
subsidiaries has a business relationship regarding the business of such other
Party and its subsidiaries

 

50

   

or this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without
the prior written consent of such other Party.

 

(b)Each Party will hold, and will cause its respective Representatives and
Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including any information
exchanged pursuant to this Section 7.2, in confidence to the extent required
by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the confidentiality
provisions in Section 2 of the Exclusivity Agreement, which confidentiality
provisions shall remain in full force and effect pursuant to the terms thereof
notwithstanding the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
termination thereof.

 

Section 7.3No Solicitation; Superior Proposals.

 

(a)Except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.3, SST IV shall not, and
shall cause each of the SST IV Subsidiaries and shall direct each of its and
their respective directors, officers, Affiliates and Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, facilitate or knowingly
encourage any inquiries, proposals or offers for, or engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information
or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to, any inquiry,
proposal, offer or other action that constitutes, or may reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or engage in,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any
Person regarding or otherwise in furtherance of, or furnish to any Person
other than SmartStop or its Representatives, any information in connection
with or for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating any inquiry, proposal,
offer or other action that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, or to otherwise obtain, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) release any
Person from or fail to enforce any confidentiality agreement, standstill
agreement or similar obligation (provided that SST IV shall be permitted to
waive or to not enforce any provision of any confidentiality agreement,
standstill agreement or similar obligation to permit a Person to make a
confidential Acquisition Proposal directly to the SST IV Special Committee if
the SST IV Special Committee determines in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel that any such failure to waive or to not enforce would
be inconsistent with the SST IV directors' duties under Maryland Law), (iv)
enter into any Contract contemplating or otherwise relating to an Acquisition
Proposal (other than an Acceptable NDA pursuant to Section 7.3(b)), or (v)
take any action to exempt any Person from any Takeover Statute or similar
restrictive provision of the SST IV Charter, the SST IV Bylaws or
organizational documents or agreements of any SST IV Subsidiary. In
furtherance of the foregoing and as otherwise permitted by this Section 7.3,
SST IV shall, and shall cause each SST IV Subsidiary and each Representative
of SST IV and the SST IV Subsidiaries to, immediately cease any discussions,
negotiations or communications with any Person with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and shall promptly terminate all
physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such Person
and use reasonable efforts to cause such Person to return or destroy all non-
public information concerning SST IV and the SST IV Subsidiaries to the extent
permitted pursuant to any confidentiality agreement with such Person.

 

(b)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to the time, but not after, Stockholder Approvals are obtained, SST IV
and its Representatives may, in response to an unsolicited, bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 7.3,
(x) contact such Person to clarify the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal and (y)(i) provide information in response to a request
therefor by the Person who made such written Acquisition Proposal; provided
that (A) such information is provided pursuant to (and only pursuant to) one
or more Acceptable NDAs, and (B) SST IV, prior to or concurrently with the
time such information is provided, provides such information to SmartStop, and
(ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with the Person
who made such written Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, in
each such case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, the SST IV Special
Committee has either determined that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal or determined in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel and outside financial advisors that such Acquisition Proposal
could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.

 

(c)SST IV will promptly (and in any event no later than one (1) Business Day
after receipt thereof) notify SmartStop in writing if (i) any Acquisition
Proposal is received by SST IV or any SST IV Subsidiary, (ii) any request for
information relating to SST IV or any SST IV Subsidiary is received by SST IV
or any SST IV Subsidiary from any Person who informs SST IV or any SST IV
Subsidiary that it is considering making or has made an Acquisition Proposal
or (iii) any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated with SST
IV or any SST IV

 

51

   

Subsidiary regarding any Acquisition Proposal, and shall, in any such notice
to SmartStop, indicate the identity of the Person making, and the material
terms and conditions of, such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (and
shall include with such notice (A) copies of any written Acquisition Proposal,
including any proposed transaction agreement and any related transaction
documents and financing commitments, if any, and (B) a written summary of the
material terms of any related Acquisition Proposal not made in writing
(including any material terms proposed orally or supplementally)), and
thereafter shall promptly (and in any event no later than one (1) Business Day
after the occurrence of such developments, discussions or negotiations or
receipt of materials) (I) keep SmartStop reasonably informed of all material
developments, discussions and negotiations concerning any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry and (II) provide SmartStop with any written
supplements or written additions to any written Acquisition Proposal,
including any revisions to any proposed transaction agreement and any related
transaction documents and financing commitments, if any. Neither SST IV nor
any SST IV Subsidiary will enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent
to the date of this Agreement that prohibits SST IV from providing any
information to SmartStop in accordance with this Section 7.3.

 

(d)Except as expressly provided in Section 7.3(e), Section 7.3(f), and Section
7.3(g), neither the SST IV Board, nor any committee thereof, nor any group of
directors, formally or informally, shall: (i) change, withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify or publicly propose or announce or authorize or resolve to,
or announce its intention to change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in
each case in a manner adverse to SmartStop, the SST IV Board Recommendation,
(ii) authorize, approve, endorse, declare advisable, adopt or recommend or
propose to publicly authorize, approve, endorse, declare advisable, adopt or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) authorize, cause or permit SST IV
or any SST IV Subsidiary to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement,
or (iv) fail to make the SST IV Board Recommendation or to include the SST IV
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any event described in clause
(i), (ii), (iii) or this clause (iv), an "Adverse Recommendation Change").

 

(e)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, subject to
compliance with the provisions of this Section 7.3(e), if SST IV receives an
Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal did not result from a
material breach of this Section 7.3 and is not withdrawn, and the SST IV
Special Committee determines that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisor, that failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in
connection with such Superior Proposal or that failure to terminate this
Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement for such Superior
Proposal would be inconsistent with the SST IV directors' duties under
Maryland Law, then, provided that Stockholder Approvals have not yet been
obtained, the SST IV Board (based on the recommendation of the SST IV Special
Committee) may (x) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (y) enter
into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement relating to or implementing the
Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section
9.1(c)(ii); provided, that, in the case of each of clause (x) and (y), the SST
IV Board may not take action contemplated by this Section 7.3(e) unless:

 

(i)SST IV has notified SmartStop in writing that the SST IV Board intends to
take such action at least five (5) Business Days in advance of effecting an
Adverse Recommendation Change and/or entering into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the reasons for
such action, describe the material terms of the Superior Proposal and attach
the most current version of such agreements (including any amendments,
supplements or modifications) between SST IV and the party making such
Superior Proposal (a "SST IV Change Notice"); and

 

(ii)during the five (5) Business Day period following SmartStop's receipt of a
SST IV Change Notice, SST IV shall, and shall direct its outside financial and
outside legal advisors to, negotiate in good faith with SmartStop (to the
extent SmartStop wishes to negotiate) to make adjustments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement such that the Superior Proposal ceases to
constitute (in the good faith determination of the SST IV Special Committee,
after consultation with outside legal counsel and outside financial advisors)
a Superior Proposal; provided, that any amendment, supplement or modification
to any Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a new Acquisition Proposal and SST
IV may not enter into any agreement relating to the Superior Proposal pursuant
this Section 7.3(e) or make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this
Section

 

52

   

7.3(e) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) unless SST
IV has complied with the requirements of this Section 7.3(e) with respect to
such new Acquisition Proposal including sending an additional SST IV Change
Notice (except that the new negotiation period under this Section 7.3(e)(ii)
shall be four (4) Business Days instead of five (5) Business Days).
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.3(e)(ii), neither SmartStop's
acceptance nor rejection of SST IV's offer to negotiate pursuant to this
Section 7.3(e)(ii) shall have any bearing on SmartStop's right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii) herein.

 

(f)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
after the date of this Agreement and before Stockholder Approvals are
obtained, the SST IV Special Committee and the SST IV Board may, if the SST IV
Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with
SST IV's directors' duties under Maryland Law, make an Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to an Intervening Event; provided, that, prior to making
such Adverse Recommendation Change, SST IV shall have complied with clauses
(i) and (ii) of Section 7.3(e).

 

(g)Nothing in this Section 7.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent
the SST IV Special Committee, the SST IV Board or SST IV, directly or
indirectly, from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of SST IV a
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal as contemplated by Rule 14d-9
or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any required
disclosure to the stockholders of SST IV under applicable Law, including Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or
(iii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of SST IV if the SST IV Board
determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel
(and based on the recommendation of the SST IV Special Committee) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the duties of the SST IV directors
under Maryland Law; provided, however, that to the extent any such disclosure
addresses the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the
SST IV Special Committee or the SST IV Board with respect to this Agreement or
an Acquisition Proposal, such disclosure shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change if not accompanied by an express public affirmation of
the SST IV Board Recommendation; provided, further, that a "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act shall not be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation
Change.

 

(h)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none
of SST IV, any SST IV Subsidiary or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives shall reimburse or agree to reimburse the fees or expenses of
any Person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, in connection with any Acceptable NDA but excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, in connection with any acquisition agreement or merger
with respect to a Superior Proposal entered into pursuant to this Section 7.3
and resulting in termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)).

 

(i)SST IV agrees that in the event any Representative of SST IV or any SST IV
Subsidiary takes any action that, if taken by SST IV would constitute a
violation of this Section 7.3, and such action was taken at the direction or
with the prior consent of the SST IV Special Committee, then SST IV shall be
deemed to be in violation of this Section 7.3 for all purposes of this
Agreement.

 

(j)For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i)"Acquisition Proposal" means any bona fide proposal or offer from any
Person (other than SmartStop or any SmartStop Subsidiaries) made after the
date of this Agreement, whether in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, relating to any (A) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination or similar transaction involving SST IV or any SST IV
Subsidiary that would constitute a "significant subsidiary" (as defined in
Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X) representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the
consolidated assets of SST IV, (B) sale or other disposition, by merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination or any similar
transaction, of any assets of SST IV or any SST IV Subsidiaries that are
significant subsidiaries representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the
consolidated assets of SST IV, (C) issue, sale or other disposition by SST IV
or any SST IV Subsidiaries of (including by way of

 

53

   

merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or any similar
transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or
securities convertible into, such securities) representing twenty percent
(20%) or more of the votes associated with the outstanding shares of SST IV
Common Stock, (D) tender offer or exchange offer in which any Person or
"group" (as such term is defined under the Exchange Act) shall acquire
beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange
Act), or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, of twenty percent (20%) or
more of the votes associated with the outstanding shares of SST IV Common
Stock, or (E) recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or
other similar type of transaction with respect to SST IV in which a third
party shall acquire beneficial ownership of twenty percent (20%) or more of
the outstanding shares of SST IV Common Stock; provided, however, that the
term "Acquisition Proposal" shall not include (I) the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (II) any merger,
consolidation, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization or
similar transaction solely among SST IV and one or more of the SST IV
Subsidiaries or solely among the SST IV Subsidiaries.

 

(ii)"Intervening Event" means, with respect to SST IV, a change in
circumstances or development that materially affects the business, assets or
operations of SST IV and the SST IV Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that was
not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the SST IV Board prior to the
execution of this Agreement, which change in circumstances or development
becomes known to the SST IV Board prior to Stockholder Approvals being
obtained; provided, however, that in no event shall the following events,
circumstances or changes in circumstances constitute an Intervening Event: (i)
the receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any matter
relating thereto or consequence thereof, (ii) any effect arising out of or
related to the COVID-19 pandemic or COVID-19 Measures and (iii) any effect
arising out of the announcement or pendency of, or actions required to be
taken pursuant to, this Agreement.

 

(iii)"Superior Proposal" means a written Acquisition Proposal (except for
purposes of this definition, the references in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" to "twenty percent (20%)" shall be replaced with "fifty percent
(50%)") that the SST IV Board (based on the recommendation of the SST IV
Special Committee) determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation
with its outside legal and financial advisors, and after taking into account
(A) all of the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal and this
Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by SmartStop) and (B) the
feasibility and certainty of consummation of such Acquisition Proposal on the
terms proposed (taking into account such legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and conditions to consummation
thereof as the SST IV Special Committee determines in good faith to be
material to such analysis)), to be more favorable from a financial point of
view to the stockholders of SST IV (in their capacities as stockholders) than
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (as it
may be proposed to be amended by SmartStop) pursuant to Section 7.3(e)(ii).

limit the freedom of such Party, its subsidiaries (including subsidiaries of
SmartStop after the Closing) or their Affiliates with respect to, or their

(b)In connection with and without limiting the foregoing Section 7.5(a), each
of the Parties shall give (or shall cause their respective Affiliates to give)
any notices to third parties, and each of the Parties shall use, and cause
each of their respective Affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to
obtain any third party consents that are necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

Parties shall cooperate with respect to reasonable accommodations that may be
requested or appropriate to obtain such consents.

 

Section 7.6Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation.

 

(a)The SmartStop Parties and their Representatives shall give prompt notice to
SST IV, and SST IV and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to the
SmartStop Parties, of any notice or other communication received by such Party
from any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement, the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b)The SmartStop Parties and their respective Representatives shall give
prompt notice to SST IV, and SST IV and its Representatives shall give prompt
notice to the SmartStop Parties, if (i) any representation or warranty made by
it contained in this Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that it would
be reasonable to expect that the applicable closing conditions would be
incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date or (ii) it fails to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement; provided, that no
such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of the Parties or the conditions to the obligations of the Parties
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the failure by the SmartStop Parties, SST IV or their respective
Representatives to provide such prompt notice under this Section 7.6(b) shall
not constitute a breach of covenant for purposes of Section 8.2(b), Section
8.3(a), Section 9.1(c)(i), or Section 9.1(d)(i).

 

(c)The SmartStop Parties and their respective Representatives shall give
prompt notice to SST IV, and SST IV and its Representatives shall give prompt
notice to the SmartStop Parties, of any Action commenced or, to such Party's
Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving such Party or any
SmartStop Subsidiary or SST IV Subsidiary, respectively, or any of their
respective directors, officers or partners that relates to this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. SST IV and
its Representatives shall give the SmartStop Parties the opportunity to
reasonably participate in the defense and settlement of any Action against SST
IV or its directors, officers or partners relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall consider in good faith
SmartStop's advice with respect to such Action, and no settlement in respect
of any such Action shall be agreed to without SmartStop's prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). SmartStop and its Representatives shall give SST IV the
opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense and settlement of any
Action against SmartStop or its directors, officers or partners relating to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall
consider in good faith SST IV's advice with respect to such Action, and no
settlement in respect of any such Action shall be agreed to without SST IV's
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned).

 

Section 7.7Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

 

(a)Without limiting or being limited by the provisions of Section 7.7(b),
during the period commencing as of the Merger Effective Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Merger Effective Time, SmartStop shall (and
shall cause the Surviving Entity to), to the fullest extent SST IV would be
permitted to do so under applicable Law and the SST IV Governing Documents as
currently in effect:

 

(i)indemnify, defend and hold harmless each current and former manager,
director, officer, partner, member, trustee, employee and agent of SST IV or
any of the SST IV Subsidiaries or other individuals with rights to
indemnification or exculpation pursuant to the SST IV Governing Documents or
any indemnification agreements of SST IV or SST IV Subsidiaries (such
agreements, the "Additional Indemnification Agreements") (collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") against and

 

56

   

from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any Action to the extent such Action arises out of or pertains
to (A) any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such
Indemnified Party's capacity as a manager, director, officer, partner, member,
trustee, employee or agent of SST IV or any of the SST IV Subsidiaries
(whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Merger Effective Time)
or (B) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Merger Effective Time), and

 

(ii)pay in advance of the final disposition of any such Action the costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and any expenses incurred by
any Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to
indemnification of any Indemnified Party), without the requirement of any bond
or other security, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, but subject to SmartStop's or the Surviving Entity's receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such amount if
it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled
to be indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, SmartStop or the Surviving Entity, as applicable, (x) shall not
settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any Action against or of any Indemnified Party for
which indemnification may be sought under this Section 7.7(a) without the
Indemnified Party's prior written consent (which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Action that is
subject to indemnification by SmartStop and the Surviving Entity under this
Section 7.7(a), (y) shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) and (z) shall not have any obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine in a final and non-appealable order that such indemnification is
prohibited by applicable Law.

 

(b)Without limiting the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, each of SmartStop and the Surviving Entity agree that during the period
commencing as of the Merger Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Merger Effective Time, all rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Merger Effective Time, and advancement of expenses now existing in favor
of any Indemnified Party as provided in the SST IV Governing Documents and
Additional Indemnification Agreements shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 

(c)For a period of six (6) years following the Merger Effective Time, the
organizational documents of SmartStop, Merger Sub and any applicable SmartStop
Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions and
rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party than those included in the SST IV Governing Documents or any
similar organizational documents or agreements of any SST IV Subsidiary. No
such provision shall be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six (6) years following the Merger Effective Time in any manner that would
affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the
Merger Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties, unless such modification
shall be required by applicable Law and then only to the minimum extent
required by applicable Law.

 

(d)For a period of six (6) years after the Merger Effective Time, SmartStop
shall cause the Surviving Entity to maintain in effect SST IV's current
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering each Person currently
covered by SST IV's directors' and officers' liability insurance policies for
acts or omissions occurring prior to and through the Merger Effective Time;
provided, that in lieu of such obligation, (i) the Surviving Entity may
substitute therefor policies of an insurance company with the same or better
rating as SST IV's current insurance carrier the material terms of which,
including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect
to such directors and officers than SST IV's existing policies as of the date
hereof or (ii) in consultation with SmartStop,

 

57

   

SST IV may obtain extended reporting period coverage under SST IV's existing
insurance programs (to be effective as of the Merger Effective Time) for a
period of six (6) years after the Merger Effective Time for a cost not in
excess of three times the current annual premiums for such insurance; and
provided, further, that in no event shall the Surviving Entity be required to
pay annual premiums for insurance under this Section 7.7(d) in excess of 300%
of the most recent annual premiums paid by SST IV for such purpose, it being
understood that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, the Surviving Entity shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such
coverage as may be obtained for such 300% amount.

 

(e)If SmartStop or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-
up, or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and

and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all successors
and assigns of SmartStop, SST IV and the Surviving Entity and shall not be
amended in a manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Party (including his or
her successors, assigns and heirs) without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (including such successors, assigns and heirs) affected
thereby. The exculpation and indemnification provided for by this Section 7.7
shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which an
Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law, Contract or
otherwise. SmartStop shall cause the Surviving Entity to pay all reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in enforcing the obligations provided in this Section 7.7.

 

Section 7.8Dividends.

 

(a)In the event that a distribution with respect to the shares of SST IV
Common Stock permitted under the terms of this Agreement has a record date
prior to the Merger Effective Time and has not been paid prior to the Closing
Date, such distribution shall be paid to the holders of such shares of SST IV
Common Stock on the Closing Date promptly after the Merger Effective Time. SST
IV shall coordinate with SmartStop on the declaration, setting of record dates
and payment dates of dividends on SST IV Common Stock so that holders of SST
IV Common Stock (i) do not receive dividends on both SST IV Common Stock and
SmartStop Class A Common Stock received in the Merger in respect of a single
distribution period or fail to receive a dividend on either SST IV Common
Stock or SmartStop Class A Common Stock received in the Merger in respect of
a single distribution period or (ii) do not receive both a dividend permitted
by the proviso to Section 6.2(b)(iii) on SmartStop Class A Common Stock
received in the Merger and a dividend permitted by the proviso to Section
6.1(b)(iii) on SST IV Common Stock or fail to receive either a dividend
permitted by the proviso to Section 6.2(b)(iii) on SmartStop Class A Common
Stock received in the Merger or a dividend permitted by the proviso to
Section 6.1(b)(iii) on SST IV Common Stock.

 

(b)In the event that either SST IV or SmartStop shall declare or pay any
dividend or other distribution that is expressly permitted pursuant to the
proviso at the end of Section 6.1(b)(iii) or Section 6.2(b)(iii),
respectively, it shall notify the other Party at least twenty (20) days prior
to the Closing Date, and such other Party shall be entitled to declare a
dividend per share payable (i) in the case of SST IV, to holders of SST IV
Common Stock, in an amount per share of SST IV Common Stock equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the dividend declared by SmartStop with
respect to each share of SmartStop Class A Common Stock by (B) the Exchange
Ratio, and (ii) in the case of SmartStop, to holders of SmartStop Class A
Common Stock, in an amount per share of SmartStop Class A Common Stock equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the dividend declared by SST IV with
respect to each share of SST IV Common Stock by (B) the Exchange Ratio. The
record date and time and payment date and time for any dividend payable
pursuant to this Section 7.8(b) shall be prior to the Closing Date.

applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be

documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer,
value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any transfer, recording,
registration and other fees and any similar taxes that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together with
any related interest, penalties or additions to such taxes, "Transfer Taxes"),
and shall reasonably cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of
Transfer Taxes. These taxes shall be the obligations of SmartStop and the
SmartStop Subsidiaries without deduction or withholding from or to the Merger
Consideration.

 

(e)With respect to the taxable year of SST IV ending with the Merger Effective
Time, SST IV shall take all necessary actions, including declaring and paying
dividends sufficient to satisfy its requirement under Section 857(a)(1), to
cause SST IV to qualify as a REIT for its shortened taxable year ending with
the Merger Effective Time.

due, the Payor shall reimburse the Recipient for all reasonable costs and
expenses actually incurred or accrued by the Recipient (including reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and
enforcement of this Section 9.3. Further, if the Payor fails to timely pay any
amount due to the Recipient pursuant to Section 9.3(b) and, in order to obtain
the payment, the Recipient commences an Action that results in a judgment
against the Payor for the payment set forth in this Section 9.3, the Payor
shall pay to the Recipient its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees) in connection with such
Action, together with interest on such amount at a rate per annum equal to the
prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

 

(f)If the Payor becomes obligated to make a payment under this Section 9.3,
then, if requested by the Recipient, the Payor shall deposit into escrow an
amount in cash equal to the Termination Payment or the Expense Reimbursement
Payment, as applicable, with an escrow agent selected by the Recipient, after
reasonable consultation with the Payor, and pursuant to a written escrow
agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") reflecting the terms set forth in this
Section 9.3(f) and otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Payor and the escrow
agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Termination Payment or the
Expense Reimbursement Payment, as applicable, shall be made by the Payor in
accordance with the timing set forth in Section 9.3(c) or, at the Recipient's
reasonable request, promptly after receipt of notice from the Recipient that
the Escrow Agreement has been executed by the parties thereto. The Escrow
Agreement shall provide that the Termination Payment or the Expense
Reimbursement Payment, as applicable, in escrow or the applicable portion
thereof shall be released to the Recipient on an annual basis based upon the
delivery by Recipient to the escrow agent of any one (or a combination) of the
following:

 

65

   

(i)a letter from the Recipient's independent certified public accountants
indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the
Recipient without causing the Recipient to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the applicable taxable year of the
Recipient determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(I) or 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code
(such income, "Qualifying REIT Income"), in which case the escrow agent shall
release to the Recipient such maximum amount stated in the accountant's
letter;

 

(ii)a letter from the Recipient's counsel indicating that the Recipient
received a private letter ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the
Recipient of the Termination Payment or Expense Reimbursement Payment, as
applicable, would either constitute Qualifying REIT Income or would be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release to the Recipient the
remainder of the Termination Payment or Expense Reimbursement Payment, as
applicable; or

 

(iii)a letter from the Recipient's counsel indicating that the Recipient has
received a tax opinion from the Recipient's outside counsel or accountant,
respectively, to the effect that the receipt by the Recipient of the
Termination Payment or Expense Reimbursement Payment, as applicable, should
either constitute Qualifying REIT Income or should be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which
case the escrow agent shall release to the Recipient the remainder of the
Termination Payment or Expense Reimbursement Payment, as applicable.

 

The Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to amend this Section 9.3(f) at
the reasonable request of the Recipient in order to (A) maximize the portion
of the Termination Payment or Expense Reimbursement Payment, as applicable,
that may be distributed to the Recipient hereunder without causing the
Recipient to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code, (B) improve the Recipient's chances of securing the favorable
private letter ruling from the IRS described in this Section 9.3(f) or (C)
assist the Recipient in obtaining the favorable tax opinion from its outside
counsel or accountant described in this Section 9.3(f). The Escrow Agreement
shall provide that the Recipient shall bear all costs and expenses under the
Escrow Agreement. The Payor shall not be a party to the Escrow Agreement and
shall not bear any liability, cost or expense resulting directly or indirectly
from the Escrow Agreement (other than any Taxes imposed on the Payor in
connection therewith).

Severability

 

. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced under any present or future Law, or public policy,
(a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable, (b) this Agreement
shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never comprised a part hereof, and (c) all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable term or other
provision or by its severance herefrom so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that transactions contemplated by this
Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 

Counterparts

 

. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which together shall be deemed one and the same
agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered (electronically by email or
facsimile) to the other Parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by
facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in portable document form (pdf), or
by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and
pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical
delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.

 

Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries

 

. This Agreement (including the Exhibit, Schedules, the SmartStop Disclosure
Letter and the SST IV Disclosure Letter) and Section 2 of the Exclusivity
Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written

 

67

   

and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and (b) except for the provisions of Article 3 and Section 7.7,
which, from and after the Merger Effective Time, shall be for the benefit of
the holders of SST IV Common Stock immediately prior to the Merger Effective
Time and Indemnified Parties, respectively, are not intended to confer upon
any Person other than the Parties hereto any rights or remedies. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties and any inaccuracies in such representations
and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with Section
10.6 without notice or liability to any other Person. Consequently, Persons
other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in
this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the
date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 

Amendment; Extension; Waiver

 

. At any time prior to the Merger Effective Time, SST IV (in all events
subject to the prior approval of the SST IV Special Committee) and SmartStop
(for itself and on behalf of the other SmartStop Parties, and in all events
subject to the prior approval of the SmartStop Special Committee) may, to the
extent permitted under applicable Law and except as otherwise set forth
herein, (a) amend any provision of this Agreement, (b) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Party, (c)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other
Party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement or (d) subject to the requirements of applicable Law, waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any such amendment of this Agreement shall be valid only if
specifically set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of all
Parties. Any such grant by a Party of an extension or waiver in respect of any
provision of this Agreement shall be valid only if specifically set forth in
an instrument in writing by such Party. The failure of any Party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of those rights. The rights and remedies herein
provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by Law, except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in Section
9.3 (Fees and Expenses).

 

Section 10.7Governing Law; Venue.

 

(a)This Agreement, and all claims or causes of actions (whether at Law, in
contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or related to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement,
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of Maryland without giving effect to its conflicts of laws principles (whether
the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland).

 

(b)All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be heard and determined exclusively in
any Maryland state or federal court located in Baltimore City exercising
jurisdiction over the subject matter of such dispute(s). Each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of any such Maryland state or federal court located in Baltimore
City for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any Party, (ii) agrees not to commence any such Action
except in such courts, (iii) agrees that any claim in respect of any Action
may be heard and determined in any such Maryland state or federal court, (iv)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection to
such court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over the Party in any such
dispute, (v) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such Action, (vi) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such dispute and
(vii) agrees, with respect to any Action filed in a Maryland state court, to
jointly request an assignment to the Maryland Business and Technology Case
Management Program. Each of the Parties agrees that a final judgment in any
such dispute shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in Section 10.2. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party
to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

Assignment

 

. Except as may be required to satisfy the obligations contemplated by Section
7.7 (Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance), neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement
shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or
otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the
other Parties. This Agreement shall be binding upon,

 

68

   

inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns, and any attempted or purported assignment
or delegation in violation of this Section 10.8 shall be null and void.

 

Specific Performance

 

. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that, prior to the effective time of any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article 9, each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and each Party hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is
entitled at Law or in equity. In the event that any Action should be brought
in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no Party shall allege,
and each Party hereby waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at
law. To the extent any Party brings an Action to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an
Action to specifically enforce any provision that survives termination of this
Agreement) when expressly available to such Party pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended to (a) the
twentieth (20th) Business Day following the resolution of such Action, or (b)
such other time period established by the court presiding over such Action.

 

Waiver of Jury Trial

 

. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY and UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, ANY INSTRUMENT OR OTHER DOCUMENT DELIVERED
PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.
EACH PARTY (a) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (b) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER AND THAT IT
MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (c) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.10.

 

Authorship

 

. The Parties agree that the terms and language of this Agreement are the
result of negotiations between the Parties and their respective advisors and,
as a result, there shall be no presumption that any ambiguities in this
Agreement shall be resolved against any Party. Any controversy over
construction of this Agreement shall be decided without regard to events of
authorship or negotiation.
