v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and entered into
as of July __, 2007, by and among Hewlett-Packard Company, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Narwhal Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and
Neoware, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company").

_RECITALS_

A. It is proposed that Merger Sub will merge with and into Company (the
"Merger") and each share (a "Share") of the Common Stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of Company ("Company Common Stock") that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger (other than Shares held by Company or Parent
or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Company or of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time) will thereupon be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to $16.25 per
Share, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), all upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein.

B. The Board of Directors of Company (the "Company Board") has unanimously (i)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of, Company
stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable the "agreement of merger"
(as such term is used in Section 251 of the DGCL) contained in this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") and (iii)
determined to recommend that Company stockholders adopt the "agreement of
merger" set forth in this Agreement.

C. The board of directors of Merger Sub has unanimously approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, and Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub,
has adopted the "agreement of merger" set forth in this Agreement, in each
case in accordance with the DGCL.

D. Parent, Merger Sub and Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Company. As a result of the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").



 

1 1.2 _Effective Time; Closing_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DGCL (the time of such filing with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Company and Parent
and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "Effective Time"). The
closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP, located at One Liberty Plaza, New York,
New York, at 10 a.m., New York City time, on the second business day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, or at such
other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the date
on which the Closing occurs, the "Closing Date").

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and Section 259 of the DGCL. 

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of Company shall be amended and restated in its
entirety to be identical to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in
accordance with the DGCL and as provided in such Certificate
of Incorporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that at the Effective Time,
Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of
the corporation is Neoware, Inc." At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of
Company shall be amended and restated in their entirety to be identical to the
Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until thereafter amended in accordance with the DGCL and as provided in such
Bylaws.

1.5 _Directors and Officers_. The initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until their respective successors are duly appointed.

1.6 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any shares
of capital stock of Company, the following shall occur:

(a) _Company Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than any (i) Shares to be canceled pursuant to
_Section 1.6(b)_ and (ii) Appraisal Shares, will be canceled and extinguished
and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal
to the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the certificate representing
such Share in the manner provided in _Section 1.7_ (or in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit and bond, if
required, in the manner provided in  _Section 1.9_). At the Effective Time,
such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such Shares (a "Certificate")
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration.



 

2 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury and Parent Owned Stock_. Each Share held by
Company or Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Company or of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and extinguished without any conversion thereof or the payment of any
consideration therefor.

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plans_. At the Effective Time, all
Company Options outstanding under the Company Stock Plans shall be treated in
accordance with _Section 5.9_.

(e) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such shares (the "Appraisal Shares") pursuant
to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.6(a)_, but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, the
Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is
not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under
Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 1.6(a)_. Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any
Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to the DGCL received by Company, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

1.7 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. Parent shall select Computershare Trust Company of New
York or another institution reasonably satisfactory to Company to act as the
Paying Agent (the "Paying Agent") in the Merger and, prior to the Effective
Time, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent reasonably
satisfactory to Company.



 

3 (b) _Parent to Provide Merger Consideration_. Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall make available or cause the Merger Sub to make available
to the Paying Agent, for payment in accordance with this _Article I_ , funds
for the benefit of the holders of Shares in amounts and at the times necessary
for the payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_
upon surrender of Certificates, it being understood that any and all interest
earned on funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement
shall be turned over to Parent. Any cash deposited with the Paying Agent
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund".

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective
Time) of a Certificate or Certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares that were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_: (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount
of cash (after taking into account all Certificates surrendered by such
holder) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_ and
the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than a Person in whose name in which the Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the
payment thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Persons
requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by
it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(e) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Paying Agent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any

amended (the "Code") or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law or under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, the amount of such consideration shall be treated for
all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom
such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis,
_provided_ that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts

the Shares formerly represented thereby. If any Certificates shall not have
been surrendered prior to two years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any Merger Consideration would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such
Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 1.7_,
neither Parent, Merger Sub, the Paying Agent nor the Surviving Corporation

shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such Merger Consideration as
may be required pursuant to _Section 1.6(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to
deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against Parent, Company, the Paying Agent or any of
their respective representatives or agents with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.7 _Intellectual Property_.

(a) Section 2.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete and
accurate list (by name and version number) as of the date hereof of all
current and standard Company Products.

(b) Section 2.7(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete and
accurate list of the following Owned Company IP: (i) all
registered Trademarks and material unregistered Trademarks; (ii) all Patents
and (iii) all registered Copyrights, in each case listing, as applicable, (A)
the name of the applicant/registrant and current owner, (B) the jurisdiction
where the application/registration is located and (C) the application or
registration number. To the knowledge of Company, none of the Owned Company IP
is invalid or unenforceable, except for any such invalidity or
unenforceability that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Section 2.7(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete and
accurate list of Companys Domain Name registrations. Section 2.7(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter identifies, for each Domain Name registration, the
named owner, and the registrar or equivalent Person with whom that Domain
Name is registered. To the knowledge of Company, Companys use and
registration of its Domain Name registrations is not improper or inappropriate
and, to the knowledge of Company, would not infringe any third partys
Intellectual Property Rights, except for any such infringement that,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. In the case in
which Company or any of its Subsidiaries has acquired ownership of a Domain
Name registration from another party, Company or its Subsidiary has made or
procured a transfer of the Domain Name in accordance with the procedure of the
registrar, except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(d) In each case in which Company or any of its Subsidiaries has acquired
ownership of any registered Trademarks, registered Copyrights or Patents
currently included in the Owned Company IP from another Person as set forth in
Section 2.7(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Company or one of its
Subsidiaries has recorded or caused to be recorded each such acquisition with
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the U.S. Copyright Office, or their
respective equivalents in the applicable jurisdiction, in each case in
accordance with applicable Laws, except as, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.



 

16 (e) Section 2.7(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete and
accurate list of all material Contracts (i) under which Company or any of its
Subsidiaries uses or has the right to use any Licensed Company IP, other than
licenses and related services agreements for commercially available software
that is used by Company or any of its Subsidiaries but not incorporated into
any Company Products and that has not been substantially customized solely for
use by Company or (ii) under which Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
licensed to others the right to use or agreed to transfer to others any of
the Company IP or Company Intellectual Property Rights, other than customer
licenses and other agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business,
in each case specifying the parties to the agreement (such agreements, the
"Company IP Agreements"). Except as set forth in any of the Company IP
Agreements, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any
exclusive license under any material Owned Company IP, Company Intellectual
Property Rights or any licenses to use any material Company Source Code (other
than source code licenses granted in connection with source code escrows). To
the knowledge of Company and except as, individually or in the aggregate,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (1) no third parties to the Company IP Agreements are in
breach thereof, (2) there are no pending disputes regarding the scope of such
Company IP Agreements, performance under the Company IP Agreements, or with
respect to payments made or received under such Company IP Agreements and (3)
all Company IP Agreements are binding and are in full force and effect.

(f) To the knowledge of Company, the Owned Company IP, together with the
Licensed Company IP, is sufficient for the conduct of the business of Company
as currently conducted. Without limiting the foregoing, to the knowledge of
Company, Company and its Subsidiaries have the right to use all material
software development tools, library functions, or compilers that the Company
and its Subsidiaries (i) use to create, modify, compile, or support any
material Company Product or (ii) use to provide any material services provided
by Company and its Subsidiaries.

(g) Company and its Subsidiaries own all right, title and interest in the
Owned Company IP, free and clear of all Liens other than (i)
encumbrances, restrictions or other obligations arising under any of the
Company IP Agreements and (ii) Liens that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had or would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

(h) Company and each of its Subsidiaries has taken reasonable and appropriate
steps to protect and preserve the confidentiality of the Trade Secrets
that comprise any part of the Company IP, and to the knowledge of Company,
there are no unauthorized uses, disclosures or infringements of any such Trade
Secrets by any Person. To the knowledge of Company, all use and disclosure by
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of Trade Secrets owned by another Person
have been pursuant to the terms of a written agreement with such Person or
were otherwise lawful, except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Without limiting the foregoing, Company and its Subsidiaries have a
policy requiring employees and certain consultants and contractors to  



 

17  execute a confidentiality and assignment agreement substantially in
Companys standard form previously provided to Parent. Company and its
Subsidiaries have enforced such policy, except where for any failures to
enforce that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(i) To the knowledge of Company, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor any of its or their current products or services or other operation
of Companys or its Subsidiaries business has infringed upon or otherwise
violated, or is infringing upon or otherwise violating, in any respect the
Intellectual Property Rights of any third party, except for any such
infringement that, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of Company, no Person or any of such Persons products or services
or other operation of such Persons business is infringing upon or otherwise
violating in any material respect any Owned Company IP.

(j) There is no Proceeding by a third party pending or, to the knowledge of
Company, threatened with respect to, and Company has not been notified in
writing of, any alleged infringement or other violation in any material
respect by Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their current
products or services or other operation of Companys or its Subsidiaries
business of the Intellectual Property Rights of such third party. To the
knowledge of Company, there is no pending or threatened claim challenging the
validity or enforceability of, or contesting Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries rights with respect to, any of the Company IP. Company and its
Subsidiaries are not subject to any Order that restricts or impairs the
use of any Company IP or Company Intellectual Property Rights, other than
restrictions or impairments that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(k) The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) will not result
in (i) Company or its Subsidiaries granting to any third party any rights or
licenses to any Company IP or Company Intellectual Property Rights, (ii) any
right of termination or cancellation under any Company IP Agreement, (iii)
the imposition of any Lien on any Owned Company IP or (iv) after the
consummation of the Merger, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries being required,
under the terms of any agreement to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party, to grant any third party any rights or licenses to any of
Parents or any of its Subsidiaries material Intellectual Property or
material Intellectual Property Rights, except, in the case of each of clauses
(i), (ii) and (iii), as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(l) To the knowledge of Company, there are no design or other errors in the
Company Products that permit unauthorized access to computers or systems of
users through those Company Products and that, individually or in the
aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable
steps and implemented reasonable procedures to try to prevent viruses and
other disabling codes from entering Company Products. For the avoidance of
doubt, any unauthorized access caused in whole or in part, by the operating
systems, hardware or software of third parties, shall not be deemed to be
caused by the Company Products.



 

18 (m) To the knowledge of Company, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is in violation in any material respect of any Company IP Agreement under
which it has licensed any software incorporated into a Company Product that is
distributed as "open source software" or under a similar licensing or
distribution model (including but not limited to the GNU General Public
License).

(n) To the knowledge of Company, neither Company nor any Subsidiary has
experienced any defects in the software and hardware used in their business
as it is currently conducted that have not been fully resolved, including any
error or omission in the processing of any data, and that have had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(o) Company and its Subsidiaries have in place the disaster recovery plans and
procedures described on Section 2.7(o) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(p) To the knowledge of Company, none of the material Company Source Code for
the Company Products has been published or disclosed by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except to its employees or advisers or pursuant to non-
disclosure agreements or under source code escrow agreements with escrow
agents that include appropriate non-disclosure provisions, or, to the
knowledge of Company, by any other person except as authorized by Company
under a non-disclosure agreement. To the knowledge of Company, no condition
has occurred that would be sufficient to entitle the beneficiary under any
source code escrow arrangement under which Company has deposited any material
Company Source Code for any Company Product to require release of such Company
Source Code, other than conditions that relate to the solvency or financial
condition of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or that relate to the
involvement of Company or its Subsidiaries in any bankruptcy, assignment for
the benefit of creditors, or other activity or Proceeding under any Law
relating to insolvency or the protection of creditors. The consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) will not
constitute a condition sufficient to entitle the beneficiary under any source
code escrow arrangement under which Company has deposited any material
Company Source Code for any Company Product to require release of such Company
Source Code.

written or unwritten or otherwise, funded or unfunded, including each
"employee benefit plan," within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA") which is or has been maintained,
contributed to, or required to be contributed to, by Company or any
Subsidiary of Company or any other Person under common control with Company or
any Subsidiary of Company within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code (each,
including each Subsidiary of Company, a "Company ERISA Affiliate") for the
benefit of any current or former employee, consultant or director of Company
or any Company ERISA Affiliate (each a "Company Employee"), and with respect
to which Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate has or may have any liability
or obligation (collectively, the "Company Employee Plans"), and (ii) each
employment, severance or consulting agreement (other than customary offer
letters provided in the ordinary course) between Company or any Company ERISA

Neither Company nor any Company ERISA Affiliate has any plan or commitment (i)

Employee Agreement, or (ii) to modify or amend any Company Employee Plan or
Company Employee Agreement (except to the extent required by Law or as

terms and in material compliance with applicable Laws, including but not
limited to ERISA and the Code. Company and its Company ERISA Affiliates
have performed in all material respects all obligations required to be
performed by them under each Company Employee Plan. All the Company Employee
Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code have
received timely determination letters from the IRS, no such determination
letter has been revoked nor has revocation been  



 

22  threatened, and no such Company Employee Plan has been amended since the
date of its most recent determination letter or application therefor in any
respect, and no act or omission has occurred, that would reasonably be
expected to result in the loss of its qualification. No "prohibited
transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406
and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, has
occurred with respect to any Company Employee Plan. Neither Company nor any
Company ERISA Affiliate is subject to any penalty or tax with respect to any
Company Employee Plan under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Sections 4975 through
4980 of the Code, nor is any employee of Company subject to any penalty under
Section 409A of the Code. Company and each Company ERISA Affiliate have timely
made all contributions and other payments required by and due under the terms
of each Company Employee Plan. Where applicable and to the knowledge of
Company, each Company Employee Plan that is maintained in any non-U.S.
jurisdiction (each, a "Company International Plan") has been approved by the
relevant taxation and Governmental Entity so as to enable Company and/or its
Company ERISA Affiliate to enjoy the most favorable taxation status possible,
and Company is not aware of any basis on which such approval may cease to
apply. Except to the extent limited by applicable Law, each Company Employee
Plan can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the Effective
Time in accordance with its terms, without material liability to
Parent, Company or any of its Company ERISA Affiliates (other than ordinary
administration expenses). There are no audits, inquiries or Proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened by the Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS") or the Department of Labor ("DOL"), or any similar
Governmental Entity with respect to any Company Employee Plan. No Company
Employee Plan has assets that include securities issued by Company or a
Company ERISA Affiliate. There are no Proceedings pending, or, to the
knowledge of Company, threatened or reasonably anticipated (other than routine
claims for benefits) against any Company Employee Plan.

(d) _No Pension or Welfare Plans_. Neither Company nor any Company ERISA
Affiliate has ever maintained or contributed to (i) a "employee pension
benefit plan," within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA ("Pension Plan")
that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, (ii) a
Pension Plan which is a "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA, (iii) a Pension Plan which is a "multiple employer plan" for purposes
of ERISA, (iv) a "funded welfare plan" within the meaning of Section 419 of
the Code, or (v) a Company International Plan that is a defined benefit
pension plan. No Company Employee Plan provides health benefits that are not
fully insured through an insurance contract. No Company International Plan has
any material unfunded liabilities that, as of the Effective Time, will not be
offset by insurance or fully accrued.

(e) _No Post-Employment Obligations_. No Company Employee Plan currently
provides, or reflects or represents any liability to provide post-termination
or retiree welfare benefits to any person for any reason, except as may be
required by COBRA or other applicable statute, and neither Company nor any
Company ERISA Affiliate has any liability to provide post-termination or
retiree welfare benefits to any person or ever represented, promised or
contracted to any Company Employee (either individually or to Company
Employees as a group) or any other person that such Company Employee(s)
or other person would be provided with post-termination or retiree welfare
benefits, except to the extent required by COBRA or other applicable statute.
As used in this Agreement, "COBRA" shall mean the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended and as codified in Section
4980B of the Code and Section 601 et. seq. of ERISA.

requirements of COBRA, the requirements of the Family Medical Leave Act of
1993, as amended, the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996, the requirements of the Womens Health and Cancer
Rights Act of 1998, the requirements of the Newborns and Mothers Health
Protection Act of 1996, or any amendment to each such act, or any similar
provisions of foreign and state Laws applicable to Company Employees.

(g) _Effect of Transaction_.

(1) The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of an
individuals termination of employment within one year prior to or three years
following the transactions contemplated hereby), constitute an event under any
Company Employee Plan, Company Employee Agreement, trust or loan with respect
to any Company Employee that will or may result in (i) any payment (whether of
severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness,

executed confidentiality agreement, the terms of which are at least as
restrictive as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (an
"Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement") and (y) promptly after furnishing to
any such Person any nonpublic information that has not been previously
furnished or made available to Parent, Company furnishes Parent copies of such
nonpublic information, (B) in no event shall Company, its Subsidiaries or its

in writing, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within
twenty-four (24) hours of the initial contact with any Solicited Person), of
the identity of each Solicited Person and the date of first contact. Subject

discussion, negotiation or other action permitted by this _Section 5.3(b)_
conducted by Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its and their respective
Representatives.

practicable (and, in any event, within 24 hours) after receipt of any

it reasonably believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal, Company shall
provide Parent with oral and written notice of the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity
of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry and a copy of all written materials provided in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. Company shall provide Parent as
promptly as practicable (and, in any event within 24 hours) oral and written

material amendments or proposed material amendments) of any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry and shall immediately provide to Parent a copy of
all written materials subsequently provided to or by Company in connection
with such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

(d) _Superior Offers_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
_Section 5.3(a)_ or _Section 5.3(b)_ , at any time prior to receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, in the event that Company receives (x) an
unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that
did not result from a breach of _Section 5.3(a)_ or (y) a bona fide written
Acquisition proposal from a Solicited Person that did not result from a breach
of _Section 5.3(b)_ (or a breach of _Section 5.3(a)_ after the Solicitation
Period End Date), and the Company Board determines in good faith (following
the receipt of the advice of its outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to result
in, a Superior Offer, Company may then take the following actions:

(i) Furnish non-public information to the third party making such Acquisition
Proposal, _provided_ that (A) (1) one business day prior to furnishing any
such nonpublic information to such party, Company gives Parent written notice
of its intention to furnish nonpublic information and (2) Company receives
from the third party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B)
contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such third
party, Company furnishes Parent a list of such nonpublic information provided
to such third party and, to the extent such nonpublic information has not
been previously furnished to Parent, copies of such nonpublic information;
and



 

38 (ii) Engage in discussions and negotiations with the third party with respect
to the Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ that one business day prior to
entering into discussions or negotiations with such third party, Company gives
Parent written notice of the intention to enter into negotiations with such
third party.

(e) _Changes of Recommendation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in _Section 5.2(b)_ or this _Section 5.3_, at any time prior to
receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify the Company Board Recommendation, and, in the case
of a Superior Offer that is a tender or exchange offer made directly to its
stockholders, may recommend that its stockholders accept the tender or
exchange offer (any of the foregoing actions, whether by the Company Board or
a committee thereof, together with any other public statement that makes it
reasonably apparent that the Company Board or a committee thereof desires to
take any of the following actions, a "Change of Recommendation"), if, and only
if, all of the following conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (v) are
met: 

(i) The Company Board receives an Acquisition Proposal not solicited in breach
of this _Section 5.3_ that constitutes a Superior Offer and such Superior
Offer has been made and has not been withdrawn;

(ii) Company shall not have breached any of the provisions set forth in
_Section 5.2_ or this _Section 5.3_;

(iii) The Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after receipt of
advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer,
the failure of the Company Board to effect a Change of Recommendation would be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to
its stockholders under applicable Law;

(iv) Company shall have delivered to Parent written notice (a "Change of
Recommendation Notice") at least five (5) business days prior to effecting
such Change of Recommendation, which notice shall (1) state expressly that
Company has received an Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board has
determined is a Superior Offer and that Company intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation and the manner in which it intends or may intend to do so and
(2) include the identity of the person making such Superior Offer, the most
current written draft agreement relating to the transaction that constitutes
such Superior Offer and all related transaction agreements to which Company
would be a party; _provided_ that any material amendment to the terms of such
Superior Offer shall require a new notice and a new five (5) business day
period; and



 

39 (v) during any such five (5) business day period, Company and the Company
Board shall have considered in good faith any counter-proposal to such
Superior Offer made by Parent and directed its financial and legal advisors to
negotiate on its behalf in good faith with respect to the terms of such
counter-proposal.

(f) _Compliance with Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prohibit Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that the content of any such disclosure
thereunder shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement;  _provided_ ,
_further_ that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any "stop-
look-and-listen" communication by Company or the Company Board to the
stockholders of Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act shall not be considered a failure to make, or a withdrawal,
amendment, modification or change of, all or a portion of the Company Board
Recommendation. Without limiting the foregoing proviso, Company shall not
effect a Change of Recommendation unless specifically permitted pursuant to
the terms of _Section 5.3(e)_. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3(f)_
shall be interpreted to affect or otherwise qualify, limit or modify in any
way the rights of Parent set forth in _Article VII_.

(g) _Certain Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms
shall have the following meanings:

(i) "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any offer or proposal, or indication of
interest in making an offer or proposal, relating to any transaction or
series of related transactions involving, directly or indirectly: (A) the
purchase or acquisition by any Person or "group" (as defined under Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) of more
than a fifteen percent (15%) interest in the total outstanding voting
securities of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any tender offer or
exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person or group
beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of the total outstanding
voting securities of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) any merger,
consolidation, business combination or other transaction involving Company or
any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to which the Company stockholders immediately

transaction, (C) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license, acquisition or
disposition of assets of Company (including its Subsidiaries taken as a whole)
representing more than fifteen percent (15%) of the aggregate fair market
value of Companys business immediately prior to such acquisition, or (D) any
liquidation or dissolution (or the adoption of a plan pertaining thereto) of
Company or the declaration or payment of an extraordinary dividend (whether in

transactions contemplated hereby shall not be deemed an Acquisition Proposal
in any case; and

(ii) "Superior Offer" shall mean any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
not solicited in breach of _Section 5.3_ involving the acquisition, directly
or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation or other business combination, all or substantially all of the
assets of Company or a majority of the outstanding Shares, on terms that the
Company Board has in good faith concluded (following the receipt of advice of
its outside legal counsel and its financial adviser), taking into account,
among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal and the Person making the proposal, (a) 



 

40  would be more favorable from a financial point of view to Companys
stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders) than the terms of this
Agreement (in each case taking into account any changes to the terms of this

procedures and financial reporting processes) during the period prior to
the Effective Time to obtain all information concerning its business,
including the status of product development efforts, properties, results of
operations and personnel, as such other party may reasonably request, and,
during such period, upon request Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent a copy of any report, schedule,

set forth in _Article VI_ or any other obligations of the parties hereto
under this Agreement.

5.5  _Public Disclosure_. Parent and Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or making any public statement with respect
to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or
make any such public statement without the prior written consent of the other

_however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party,
issue such press release or make such public statement as such party
determines in good faith, following consultation with legal counsel, is
required by Law or the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Global Market or
the New York Stock Exchange if it has used commercially reasonable efforts to
consult with the other party prior thereto and _provided_ , _further_ , that,
following a Change of Recommendation, no such consultation or agreement shall
be required.

with respect to any such filing, shall permit the other to review and discuss
in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection
with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white

information and promptly provide the other with copies of all filings,
presentations or submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations)

Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, _provided_ that with
respect to any such filing, presentation or submission, each of Parent and
Company need not supply the other with copies (or in case of oral
presentations, a summary) to the extent that any Law applicable to such party
requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any
such properties or information. Except to the extent prohibited by applicable
Law, Parent and Company (or their respective counsel) shall consult with the
other on the strategy for dealing with the FTC, DOJ, the European Commission
or any other Governmental Entity with responsibility for reviewing

its counsel) of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable
Governmental Entity such amendment or supplement.

(d) _Reasonable Efforts_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each of the
parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with

consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable
best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all commercially
reasonable acts necessary to cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in
_Article VI_ to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers and Consents from Governmental Entities and the making of

avoid any Proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of
all necessary Consents from third parties, and (iv) the execution or delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions

connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Company and the Company
Board shall, if any takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable
to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as

required to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Merger, under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as
amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, and any other Law designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolizing or
restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"), to respond to any
governmental requests for information under any Antitrust Law, and to contest
and resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial
action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts, prevents or prohibits the
consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any Antitrust Law, including vigorously defending in
litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any party through
a final and nonappealable judgment. If any objections are asserted with
respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust
Law or if any suit is instituted by any Governmental Entity or any private
party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of
any Antitrust Law, each of Parent, Merger Sub and Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections or challenge as such
Governmental Entity or private party may have to such transactions under such
Antitrust Law so as to permit the consummation of all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



 

43 (f) _Limitation on Divestiture_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to require
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any Action of
Divestiture, and Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, take or agree to take any Action of Divestiture. For purposes of this
Agreement, an "Action of Divestiture" shall mean agreeing, proposing or
carrying out any agreement (i) to limit in any manner whatsoever or not to
exercise any rights of ownership of any securities (including the Company

Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) to limit in any manner whatsoever

satisfied by it under this Agreement such that the condition set forth in
_Section 6.3(b)_ would not be satisfied.

(b) _By Parent_. Parent shall give prompt written notice to Company of any
representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub contained in this

be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement such that
the condition set forth in _Section 6.2(b)_ would not be satisfied.

to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the transactions

of any, Company Option. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the holders
of Company Options, each Company Option shall be either exercised by the
option holder or cancelled and extinguished and automatically converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash from the Surviving Corporation equal to
the positive product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of
Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the per share exercise price of such Company Option (the
"Option Consideration"). For the avoidance of doubt, each Company Option
having a per  



 

44  share exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall
at the Effective Time automatically be canceled and extinguished without
the conversion thereof or the payment of any consideration therefor. The
payment of the Option Consideration to the holder of a Company Option shall be
reduced by any income or employment tax withholding required under the Code or
any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such Company Option. Prior
to the Effective Time, Company shall take all action necessary to effect the
terminations anticipated by this _Section 5.9(a)_ under any outstanding
Company Options, including, but not limited to, any actions required by the
applicable Company Stock Plan.

(b) _Conversion of Company Stock Awards Held by Certain Company Employees_.
Effective as of the Effective Time, each unvested share of Company
Stock Awards granted under the Company Stock Plans or unvested Shares
acquired through the early exercise of a Company Option ("Company Restricted
Stock") and held by a Company Employee who is employed by Company or one of
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time and becomes an
employee of Parent or one of its Subsidiaries immediately after the Effective
Time shall cease to represent Shares and shall be converted automatically into
a right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Company
Restricted Stock in an amount, and subject to such terms and conditions,
determined as provided below. Each such share of Company Restricted Stock so
converted by Parent shall be subject to, and shall become vested upon, terms
and conditions that are substantially similar to those currently applicable to
such Company Restricted Stock, except that each converted share of Company
Restricted Stock shall represent the right to receive an amount equal to the
Merger Consideration as each share vests, subject to applicable withholding
requirements, and continue to be subject to the other terms and conditions of
the Company Stock Plan under which the Company Restricted Stock was granted,
the applicable stock option agreement and the applicable restricted stock
purchase agreement, as the case may be.

(c) _Service Credit_. Each employee of Company who becomes an employee of
Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) after
the Effective Time shall be referred to hereafter as a "Continuing Employee".
Continuing Employees shall be eligible to receive benefits consistent with
Parents applicable human resources policies. Each Continuing Employee shall
receive credit for prior service with Company only for purposes of determining
the vacation accrual rate pursuant to Parents standard procedures. Each
Continuing Employees service for all other purposes shall be calculated based
upon the date of hire by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, except as
otherwise required by Law. Company shall cash-out any accrued and unused
vacation, sick leave or time off days prior to the Closing Date that Parent
determines are not able to be carried over. In addition, with respect to U.S.
employees of Company and its Subsidiaries that become eligible to participate
in Parents employee benefit plans, Parent shall (i) waive all limitations
with respect to preexisting conditions and waiting periods, except to the
extent such conditions would apply absent any changes in plan coverage,
and (ii) provide credit to each such employee for any co-payments and
deductibles under such plans where paid by the employee prior to the change in
coverage for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.



 

45 (d) _Termination of Company 401(k) Plans_. Effective as of no later than the
day immediately preceding the Effective Time, each of Company and any Company
ERISA Affiliate shall terminate Company Employee Plans that includes a Code
Section 401(k) arrangement (a "Terminating Plan") pursuant to resolutions of
the Company Board substantially in the form provided in Section 5.9(d) of the
Company Disclosure Letter. Company shall provide Parent with evidence that
such Terminating Plan(s) have been terminated before the Effective Time, and
shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Terminating
Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require.

(e) _Employee Communications_. With respect to matters described in _Section
5.9_, Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to consult with Parent
(and consider in good faith the advice of Parent) prior to sending any notices
or other communication materials to Company Employees and Company will not
send any written notices or other written communication materials to Company
Employees without the prior written consent of Parent.

(f) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This _Section 5.9_ shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and
nothing in this _Section 5.9_, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this _Section 5.9_ or is intended to be an amendment to any
Company Employee Plan.

5.10 _Indemnification; Insurance_.

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all
indemnification agreements in effect immediately prior to the date hereof
between Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on one hand, and any of their
respective current or former directors and officers, on the other hand, in and
to the extent of their capacities as such and not as securityholders
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties"). In addition, for a period of six
(6) years following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to cause the Company Charter Documents and
the Subsidiaries Charter Documents to contain provisions relating to
indemnification, exculpation and the liability of directors and officers no
less favorable than such provisions included in the Company Charter Documents
or the Subsidiary Charter Documents, as applicable, in each case as of the
date hereof, and during such six (6) year period, to not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify such documents in any manner that would affect adversely the
rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were
directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries or agents of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except as required by Law.

(b) After the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
indemnify and hold harmless and provide advancement of expenses to each
of the Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent Company was permitted to do
so under applicable Law prior to the Effective Time, against all costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any
Proceeding (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to any action or omission in their capacity as an officer, director,
fiduciary or agent of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, occurring on or
before the Effective Time, to the same extent as provided in the Company
Charter Documents as of the date hereof.



 

46 (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance ("DandO Insurance") in respect of acts or
omissions occurring on or before the Effective Time, on terms and conditions
no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than those of the DandO Insurance
in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Surviving Corporation may, at its option:

(i) substitute therefor policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries containing terms and conditions no
less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than the DandO Insurance that are
with carriers with the same or better rating as the carrier of the DandO
Insurance as of the date of this Agreement; or

(ii) request, at least ten (10) business days prior to the Effective Time,
that Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under
its existing insurance program (to be effective as of the Effective Time);

_provided_ , _further, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations
under this _Section 5.10(c)_, the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of
the amount paid by Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (which
premiums Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in Section
5.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter); _provided_ , _however_ , that, if
equivalent coverage cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by paying
aggregate premiums in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of such amount,
the Surviving Corporation shall only be required to maintain as much coverage
as can be obtained by paying aggregate premiums equal to two hundred percent
(200%) of such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing and in lieu of all
obligations of the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this
_Section 5.10(c)_, Parent or, at Parents written direction, Company, may
purchase a "tail" policy of directors and officers liability insurance
covering a period of six years after the Effective Time, which policy (i)
shall be on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties
than those of the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement and
be written by a carrier with the same or better rating as the carrier of the
DandO Insurance as of the date of this Agreement, (ii) shall be prepaid and non-
cancelable, and (iii) shall have aggregate premiums not in excess of two
hundred percent (200%) of the aggregate annual amounts paid by Company for
coverage for its last full fiscal year; _provided_ , _however_ , that, if
equivalent coverage cannot be obtained or can be obtained only by
paying aggregate premiums in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of such
amount, Parent or Company shall obtain (and the Surviving Corporation shall
only be required to maintain) as much coverage as can be obtained by paying
aggregate premiums equal to two hundred percent (200%) of such amount.

(d) This _Section 5.10_ is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its
successors and assigns.

5.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall take
all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under applicable
Law) to cause any dispositions of Shares (including derivative securities
with respect to Shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated by
_Article II_ and _Section 5.9_ by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.



 

47 5.12 _Merger Sub Compliance_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply with all
of Merger Subs obligations under or relating to this Agreement. Merger Sub
shall not engage in any business that is not in connection with or incident to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.



 

56 8.5 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure
Letter, (i) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement
shall continue in full force and effect until the Effective Time and shall
survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) are not intended to confer
upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as specifically
provided, following the Effective Time, in _Section 5.10_.

 

8.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

8.7 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_.

(a) _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

(b) _Specific Performance._ It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state or foreign country having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

8.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

8.9 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware state
court, for the purposes of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby (and each agrees that no such Proceeding
relating to this Agreement shall be brought by it or any of its affiliates
except in such courts). Each of the parties hereto further agrees that, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, service of any process, summons,
notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such partys respective address
set forth above shall be effective service of process for any Proceeding in
Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted
to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding sentence.
Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and agrees
not to plead or claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any Proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any
Delaware State court, or that any such Proceeding brought in any such court
has been brought in an inconvenient forum.



 

57 8.10 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

8.11 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties. Any purported assignment in violation of this
_Section 8.11_ shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

8.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND COMPANY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR COMPANY IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
