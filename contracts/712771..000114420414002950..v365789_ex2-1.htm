on a consolidated basis, (i) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed (taking into account all available extensions)
(and until the Effective Time will so file) all Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them in all jurisdictions, (ii) all
such Tax Returns are (or, in the case of Tax Returns to be filed prior to the Effective Time, will be) true and complete in all

Taxes that are required to be paid by any of them, except with respect to matters contested in good faith in appropriate proceedings

or the appropriate state, local or foreign Tax authority have been resolved and either no deficiencies were asserted as a result
of such examinations or any asserted deficiencies have been paid in full and reflected in the Parent Financial Statements. Except
as set forth in <U>Section 4.10(a)</U> of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are no current, pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened actions, audits, or examinations by any Governmental Entity responsible for the collection or imposition of
Taxes with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any pending judicial Tax proceedings or any other Tax disputes, assessments
or claims. Except as set forth in <U>Section 4.10(a)</U> of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received (i) a request for information related to Tax matters, or (ii) a notice of deficiency
or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted or assessed by any Governmental Entity responsible for the collection
or imposition of Taxes with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent has made available to the Company true and complete
copies of the United States federal, state, local and foreign income Tax Returns filed by Parent or its Subsidiaries and all examination
reports and statements of deficiency assessed against or agreed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries since December 31, 2009.
There are no material Liens with respect to any Taxes upon any of Parent&rsquo;s or its Subsidiaries&rsquo; assets, other than
Permitted Liens. No claim has ever been made by any Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
does not file Tax Returns that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. <B> </B></P>

duties to Parent&rsquo;s shareholders under applicable Law and that such Parent Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and
such Superior Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal after taking into account

at the annual meeting shall elect the number of directors as determined. Within the foregoing limits, the number of directors may

individual selected by a majority of the Former ConnectOne Directors then serving on the Board (including anyone who became a Legacy
Director as a result of the cessation of service of a Former ConnectOne Director) and then approved by a vote of two-thirds of

ceases service on the Board, the term &ldquo;Legacy Director&rdquo; shall mean an individual selected by a majority of the Former
Pre-Merger Center Directors then serving on the Board (including anyone who became a Legacy Director as a result of the cessation
of service of a Former Pre-Merger Center Director) and then approved by a vote of two-thirds of the entire Board, such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a replacement director cannot be selected by
means of this process after a good faith attempt to do so, &nbsp;the Board, by a vote of two-thirds of the entire Board, shall
select an individual to replace the director who has left the board.</P>
