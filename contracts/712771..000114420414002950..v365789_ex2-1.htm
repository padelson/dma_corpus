shares under the Company Stock Compensation Plans and that are not
fully vested as of the date hereof ("Company Restricted Shares") are
described in _Section 3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company
Restricted Shares are presently governed by the Company Stock Compensation
Plans and the agreements pursuant to which such Company Restricted Shares
were granted (each, a "Company Restricted Share Grant Agreement"). True and
complete copies of all Company Restricted Share Grant Agreements relating to
unvested Company Restricted Shares have been delivered to Parent's counsel
(with a designation that such copies have been delivered pursuant to Section
1.6(b) of the then current draft of this Agreement). Effective upon the

exchanged for the Per Share Stock Consideration.

date hereof ("Company Performance Units") are described in _Section 3.2(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. Such description sets forth the maximum
number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to each such
Company Performance Unit. The Company Performance Units are presently governed
by the Company Stock Compensation Plans and the agreements pursuant to which
such Company Performance Units were granted (each, a "Company Performance
Unit Grant Agreement"). True and complete copies of all Company Performance
Unit Grant Agreements relating to all Company Performance Units have been
delivered to Parent's counsel (with a designation that such copies have been
delivered pursuant to Section 1.6(c) of the then current draft of this
Agreement). Effective upon the Effective Time, all Company Performance
Units shall be deemed earned and vested in accordance with each Company
Performance Grant Agreement and the underlying shares of Company Common Stock
issuable thereunder, the calculation of which shall be based upon the
performance of the Company and the applicable peer entities through December
31, 2013, will be exchanged for the Per Share Stock Consideration.

  



  

(d) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to register under the Securities Act the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the New Stock Options, and to keep
such registration in effect until such time as all New Stock Options have
been exercised.

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and
DPC Shares), which shall be converted into treasury stock of Parent as

2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

  



  

(a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into
which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or
Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. The
Company and Parent shall have the right to review both the letter of
transmittal and the instructions prior to the Effective Time and provide
reasonable comments thereon. After the Effective Time, upon surrender of a
Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration to
which such holder of Company Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant
to the provisions of Article I, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash
constituting Merger Consideration (constituting cash to be paid in lieu of
fractional shares) or on any unpaid dividends or distributions, if any,
payable to holders of Certificates.

  



  

(b) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time
with respect to Parent Common Stock and payable to the holders of record
thereof shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until
the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with this
Article II. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock,
if any, represented by such Certificate.

  



  

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

  



  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
Merger Consideration as determined in accordance with Article I of this
Agreement and this Article II.

--- 

    



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend
or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a
shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
Parent shall pay to each former shareholder of the Company who otherwise
would be entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock an
amount in cash determined by multiplying such fractional interest by the
Parent Common Stock Average Price. All shares of Company Common Stock held by
any such former shareholder immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
aggregated before determining the need to pay cash in lieu of fractional
shares to such former shareholder.

  



  

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company for six months after the Effective Time shall be
paid to Parent. Any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of the shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional
shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock
deliverable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder
holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any
interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates are not surrendered or the
payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such payments
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental unit or
agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned
property Laws, escheat Laws and any other applicable Law, become the property
of Parent (and to the extent not in its possession shall be paid over to it),
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled to
such claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  



  

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu
of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

(h) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to make suitable arrangements with shareholders of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time to enable those shareholders to
exchange their stock certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock
for comparable stock certificates representing the same number of shares of
Parent Common Stock but reflecting that Parent's name has been changed as set
forth in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

prospectuses and other documents, together with amendments thereto,
required to be filed with the SEC since December 31, 2012 (together with the
Company's Registration Statement on Form S-1, No. 333-185979, as such

direct control of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including
all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive
ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have
a materially adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls
described in the following sentence. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP. The Company has designed disclosure controls and
procedures (within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated
under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries is made known to the management of the Company by
others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required by the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company Reports. Management of the Company
has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof,
to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Company's Board of
Directors (1) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
internal controls which could adversely affect in any material respect
the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data
and identify any material weaknesses in internal controls and (2) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Company's internal controls. The Company has no
such significant deficiencies or material weaknesses or allegations of fraud
that have not been remediated to the satisfaction of the Company's auditors
and the audit committee of the Company's Board of Directors.

  



  

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 3.5(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, since January 1, 2010, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any member of the
Company's Board of Directors or executive officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, has received any material written complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or their respective internal accounting controls.

3.10 _Taxes_.

  



  

(a) Except where a failure to file Tax Returns, a failure of any such Tax
Return to be complete and accurate in any respect or the failure to pay any
Tax, individually or in the aggregate, would not be material to the results
of operations or financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, (i) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have timely
filed (taking into account all available extensions) (and until the Effective
Time will so file) all Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them in all
jurisdictions, (ii) all such Tax Returns are (or, in the case of Tax Returns
to be filed prior to the Effective Time, will be) true and complete in all
respects, and (iii) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have duly and
timely paid (and until the Effective Time will so pay) all Taxes that are
required to be paid by any of them, except with respect to matters contested
in good faith in appropriate proceedings and adequately reserved in the
Company Financial Statements. The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (x) did not, as of the date of each consolidated statement of
condition included in the Company Financial Statements, exceed the
accruals and reserves for Tax liabilities (rather than any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the Company Financial Statements (rather than
in any notes thereto), and (y) will not exceed that reserve as adjusted for
the passage of time through the Effective Time in accordance with the past
custom and practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries in filing their Tax
Returns. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived
any statute of limitations with respect to any material Taxes or, to the
extent related to such Taxes, agreed to any extension of time with respect to
a Tax assessment or deficiency, in each case to the extent such waiver or
agreement is currently in effect. Except as set forth in _Section 3.10(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Tax Returns of the Company and its
Subsidiaries which have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the
"IRS") or the appropriate state, local or foreign Tax authority have been
resolved and either no deficiencies were asserted as a result of such
examinations or any asserted deficiencies have been paid in full and
reflected in the Company Financial Statements. Except as set forth in _Section
3.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no current, pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened actions, audits,
or examinations by any Governmental Entity responsible for the collection or
imposition of Taxes with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any pending judicial Tax proceedings or any other Tax disputes, assessments
or claims. Except as set forth in _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, as of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received (i) a request for information related to Tax
matters, or (ii) a notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount
of Tax proposed, asserted or assessed by any Governmental Entity responsible
for the collection or imposition of Taxes with respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. The Company has made available to Parent true and
complete copies of the United States federal, state, local and foreign income
Tax Returns filed by the Company or its Subsidiaries and all
examination reports and statements of deficiency assessed against or agreed
to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries since December 31, 2009. There
are no material Liens with respect to any Taxes upon any of the Company's or
its Subsidiaries' assets, other than Permitted Liens. No claim has ever been
made by any Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 3.10(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has requested
any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return which Tax Return has
not since been filed, (ii) is a party to any agreement providing for the
allocation or sharing of Taxes or otherwise has any liability for Taxes of
any person other than the Company and its Subsidiaries, (iii) has issued or
assumed any obligation under Section 279 of the Code, any high yield discount
obligation as described in Section 163(i)(1) of the Code or any registration-
required obligation within the meaning of Section 163(f)(2) of the Code that
is not in registered form, (iv) is or has been a United States real
property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code, (v) is or has been a member of an affiliated group (within the meaning
of Section 1504(a) of the Code) filing consolidated United States federal
income Tax Returns (other than such a group the common parent of which is or
was the Company), (vi) has been a party to any distribution occurring during
the last three years in which the parties to such distribution treated the
distribution as one to which Section 355 of the Code (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law) applied, or (vii) has participated
in or otherwise engaged in any "Reportable Transaction" as defined in Section
6707A(c)(1) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b).

  



  

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 3.10(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no officer, director, employee or contractor (or former
officer, director, employee or contractor) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is entitled to now, or will or may be entitled to as a
consequence of this Agreement or the Merger (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event), any payment or benefit from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which if paid or
provided would constitute an "excess parachute payment", as defined in
Section 280G of the Code or regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(d) Each plan, program, arrangement or contract that constitutes in any part
a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Section
409A of the Code is identified as such in _Section 3.10(d)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. The terms of each of the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
"nonqualified deferred compensation plans" subject to Code Section 409A (and
associated U.S. Treasury Department guidance) comply with Code Section 409A
(and associated U.S. Treasury Department guidance) and each
such "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" has been operated in
compliance with Code Section 409A (and associated U.S. Treasury Department
guidance). Each Company Stock Option has an exercise price that equals or
exceeds the fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock as of the
date of grant of such Company Stock Option (and as of any later modification
thereof within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code).

  



  

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to pay, gross
up, or otherwise indemnify any officer, director, employee or contractor for
any Taxes, including potential Taxes imposed under Section 409A or Section
4999 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have made
any payments to employees that are not deductible under Section 162(m) of the
Code and consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger will not cause any
payments to employees to not be deductible thereunder.

(f) Except as set forth in _Section 3.10(f)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to

income for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing
Date as a result of any (i) change in method of accounting for a taxable
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date; (ii) use of an improper method
of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date;
(iii) "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax law)
executed on or prior to the Closing Date; (iv) intercompany transaction or
any excess loss account described in Treasury Regulations under Section 1502
of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign Tax law); (v) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on
or prior to the Closing Date; (vi) prepaid amount received on or prior to the
Closing Date; (vii) election under Section 108(i) of the Code; or (vii)
income that accrued in a prior taxable period but that was not included in
taxable income for that or another prior taxable period.

  



  

(g) Except as set forth in _Section 3.10(g)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied with all
applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment and
withholding of Taxes and have, within the time and in the manner provided by
law, withheld and paid over to the proper Governmental Entities all amounts
required to be so withheld and paid over under applicable laws; and (ii) the
Company and its Subsidiaries have maintained such records in respect to each
transaction, event and item (including as required to support otherwise
allowable deductions and losses) as are required under applicable Tax law,
except where the failure to comply or maintain records under (i) or (ii)
would not be material to the results of operations or financial condition of
the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

  



  

(h) For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) the term "Tax" or "Taxes" shall
mean, with respect to any person, all federal, state, local, foreign and
other taxes, customs, tariffs, imposts, levies, duties, government fees or
other like assessments or charges of any kind imposed by any jurisdiction,

3.11 _Employee Benefits; Labor and Employment Matters_.

  



  

(a) Except as disclosed in _Section 3.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate
sponsor, maintain, administer, contribute to or has an obligation to
contribute to or liability under (i) any "employee pension benefit plan",
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") (the "Company Pension Plans"), (ii) any
"employee welfare benefit plan", within the meaning of Section 3(l) of ERISA
(the "Company Welfare Plans"), or (iii) any other employee benefit plan,
program, policy, agreement or arrangement, including any deferred
compensation, retirement, profit sharing, incentive, bonus, commission, stock
option or other equity based, phantom, change in control, retention,
employment, consulting, severance, dependent care, sick leave,
vacation, flex, cafeteria, retiree health or welfare, supplemental income,
fringe benefit or other similar plan, program, policy, agreement or
arrangement, whether written or unwritten (collectively with the Company
Pension Plans and the Company Welfare Plans, the "Company Benefit Plans").
Since January 1, 2008, neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has
(i) established, maintained, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any
plan subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA
or (ii) contributed to or had an obligation to contribute to any
"multiemployer plan", within the meaning of Sections 3(37) and 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA. No Company Benefit Plan is a multiple employer plan as defined in
Section 210 of ERISA. As used herein, "ERISA Affiliate", with respect to the
Company, means any entity required to be aggregated with the Company under
Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA, and with
respect to Parent, means any entity required to be aggregated with Parent
under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA.

  



  

(b) The Company has delivered to Parent's counsel true and complete copies of
each of the following with respect to each of the Company Benefit Plans
(with a designation that such copies have been delivered pursuant to Section
3.11(b) of the then current draft of this Agreement): (i) each Company
Benefit Plan (together with any and all amendments thereto), summary plan
description, summary of material modifications, employee handbooks or manuals
or, where a Company Benefit Plan has not been reduced to writing, a summary of
all material terms of such Company Benefit Plan; (ii) trust agreement,
insurance contract, annuity contract or other funding instruments if any;
(iii) the three most recent actuarial reports, if any; (iv) the three most
recent financial statements, if any; (v) the three most recent annual reports
on Form 5500, including any schedules and attachments thereto; (vi) all
determination, opinion, notification and advisory letters and rulings,
compliance statements, closing agreements, or similar materials specific to
each Company Benefit Plan from the IRS or any Governmental Entity and copies
of all pending applications with the IRS or any Governmental Entity
that relate to any Company Benefit Plan; (vii) correspondence regarding
actual or potential audits or investigations to or from the IRS, the
Department of Labor (the "DOL") or any other Governmental Entity with respect
to any Company Benefit Plan since January 1, 2011; and (viii) all material
written contracts relating to each Company Benefit Plan, including
fidelity or ERISA bonds and administrative service agreements.

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 3.11(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, at December 31, 2012, the fair value of plan assets of each
Company Pension Plan equals or exceeds the present value of the projected
benefit obligations of each such plan based upon the actuarial assumptions
used for purposes of the preparation of the Company Financial Statements for
the year ended December 31, 2012.

  



  

(d) All contributions (including all employer contributions and employee
salary reduction contributions) and premium payments required to be made
to or with respect to each Company Benefit Plan under the terms thereof,
ERISA or other applicable Law have been timely made, and all amounts properly
accrued to date as liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries which have
not been paid have been properly recorded on the books of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

(e) No event has occurred and no condition exists with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan that has subjected or could subject the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate to any tax, fine, penalty or other
liability under the Code or ERISA.

  



  

(f) Each of the Company Benefit Plans has been operated in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the provisions
of ERISA, the Code, all regulations, rulings and announcements promulgated or
issued thereunder, and all other applicable governmental laws and
regulations. Furthermore, the IRS has issued a favorable determination letter
with respect to each Company Pension Plan that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code to the effect that the Company Pension Plan
satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code (taking into account
all changes in qualification requirements under Section 401(a) for which the
applicable "remedial amendment period" under Section 401(b) of the Code has
expired) and no condition or circumstance exists which could reasonably be
expected to disqualify any such plan. Each Company Pension Plan subject to the
provisions of Section 401(k) or 401(m) of the Code, or both, has been tested
for and has satisfied the requirements of Section 401(k)(3), Section
401(m)(2) and Section 416 of the Code, as applicable, for each of the last
three plan years. There has not been, nor is there likely to be, a partial
termination of any Company Pension Plan within the meaning of Section
411(d)(3) of the Code. None of the assets of any Company Pension Plan are
invested in or consist of Company Common Stock.

(g) No non-exempt prohibited transaction, within the meaning of Section 4975
of the Code or Sections 406 or 407 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any
of the Company Benefit Plans. None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
or any plan fiduciary of any Company Benefit Plan has engaged in, or has any
liability in respect of, any transaction in violation of Section 404 of ERISA.

  



  

(h) There are no pending, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or
anticipated claims (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf
of or against any of the Company Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto.
None of the Company Benefit Plans is the subject of any pending or any
threatened investigation, audit or administrative proceeding, including any
voluntary compliance submission through the IRS\'s Employee Plans Compliance
Resolution System or the DOL\'s Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program, by or
with the IRS, the DOL or any other Governmental Entity.

  



  

(i) Except as set forth in _Section 3.11(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no Company Benefit Plan provides medical benefits, death
benefits or other non-pension benefits (whether or not insured) beyond an
employee\'s retirement or other termination of service, other than (i)
coverage mandated by continuation coverage laws, or (ii) death benefits under
any Company Pension Plan. There are no unfunded benefit obligations which are
not accounted for by full reserves shown in the Company Financial Statements,
or otherwise noted on the Company Financial Statements.

  



  

(j) There are no welfare benefit funds (within the meaning of Section 419 of
the Code) related to a Company Welfare Plan, and any Company Welfare Plan
that is a group health plan (within the meaning of Section 4980B(g)(2) of the
Code) complies with all of the applicable material requirements of Section
4980B of the Code.

  



  

(k) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is funded wholly or
partially through an insurance policy, there will be no liability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time under any such
insurance policy or ancillary agreement with respect to such insurance policy
in the nature of a retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or
other actual or contingent liability arising wholly or partially out of
events occurring prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(l) Except as set forth in _Section 3.11(l)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event, such as a termination of employment) (i) entitle any
current or former officer, employee, director or consultant of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or a bonus or (ii) accelerate the
time of payment, funding, vesting, or increase the amount, of any bonus or any
compensation due to, or result in the forgiveness of any indebtedness of, any
current or former officer, employee, director or consultant of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

(m) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has
announced an intention to create, or has otherwise created, a legally
binding commitment to adopt any additional Company Benefit Plans or to amend
or modify any existing Company Benefit Plan.

  



  

(n) With respect to the Company Benefit Plans, no event has occurred and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, there exists no condition or set of
circumstances in connection with which the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate would be subject to any liability (other than
a liability to pay benefits thereunder) under the terms of such Company
Benefit Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law which has had, or
would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

with respect to any misclassification of any Person as an independent
contractor or temporary worker hired through a temporary worker agency rather

applicable Laws respecting employment, employment practices, labor relations,
employment discrimination, health and safety, terms and conditions of

incurred, nor do they expect to incur without Parent's prior written consent,
any liability or obligation under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act, the regulations promulgated thereunder or any similar state
or local Law.

  



  

(p) There is no unfair labor practice charge or complaint against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, before the National Labor Relations Board, any court or
any Governmental Entity.

3.13 _Compliance with Applicable Law_.

  



  

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in _Section 3.13(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries hold
all material licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations necessary for
the lawful conduct of its business, and each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has complied with, and is not in default in any respect under,
any applicable Law of any federal, state or local Governmental Entity
relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries (other than where such defaults or
non-compliance will not, alone or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company). Except as disclosed in _Section 3.13(a)_  of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and its Subsidiaries have not
received notice of violation of, and do not know of any such violations of,
any of the above which have or are likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Company, or its
Subsidiaries, or to the Knowledge of the Company, any director, officer,
employee, agent or other person acting on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has, directly or indirectly, (i) used any funds of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for unlawful contributions, unlawful gifts,
unlawful entertainment or other expenses relating to political activity, (ii)
made any unlawful payment to foreign or domestic governmental officials or

Article IV and Articles V and VI of this Agreement, dated as of the date
hereof and referenced to the applicable specific sections and subsections of
Articles IV, V and VI of this Agreement, which have been delivered on the date
hereof by Parent to the Company. Each exception set forth in the Parent
Disclosure Schedule is identified by reference to, or has been grouped
under a heading referring to, a specific individual Section or subsection of
Articles IV, V or VI of this Agreement and shall be deemed disclosure with
respect to such referenced Section or subsection and also any other Section or
subsection of Articles IV, V or VI of this Agreement to which the relevance
of such item is readily apparent. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the
preceding sentence, a representation or warranty may be qualified by a
section of the Parent Disclosure Schedule even if such representation or
warranty does not expressly state that it is so qualified. Except as set forth
in the Parent Disclosure Schedule or as disclosed in any Parent Reports filed
by Parent with the SEC since December 31, 2012 and prior to the date hereof
(but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors," or disclosures of risks set forth in any "forward-
looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly

hereby represents and warrants to the Company as follows:

power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent is registered as a bank
holding company under the BHCA. Copies of the certificate of incorporation
and by-laws of Parent have previously been delivered to the Company's counsel
(with a designation that such copies have been delivered pursuant to Section

Each of Parent's Subsidiaries has the power and authority (corporate or
other) to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted
by it or the character or the location of the properties and assets owned or
leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where

Effect on Parent. Copies of the certificate of incorporation, by-laws,
certificate of formation, operating agreement, as applicable, and any other
governing documents of each Subsidiary of Parent have previously been
delivered to the Company's counsel (with a designation that such copies have

Preferred Stock (designated as Series B Preferred Stock, liquidation value

of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof.

  



  

(b) All outstanding options that may be exercised for shares of Parent Common
Stock (whether or not vested) (each, a "Parent Stock Option" and collectively
the "Parent Stock Options") and outstanding shares of restricted Parent Common
Stock ("Parent Restricted Shares") are described in _Section 4.2(b)_ of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule and are presently governed by the Parent Stock
Incentive Plans and the agreements pursuant to which such Parent Stock Options
or Parent Restricted Shares were granted (each, a "Parent Option/Restricted
Share Grant Agreement"). True and complete copies of the Parent Stock
Incentive Plans (including without limitation an amendment to the 2003 Non-
Employee Director Stock Option Plan adopted by the Board of Directors of
Parent contemporaneously with such Board's adoption of this Agreement) and
all Parent Option/Restricted Share Grant Agreements relating to outstanding
Parent Stock Options or outstanding Parent Restricted Shares have been

the holder, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock covered thereby, the
date of grant, the exercise price, the vesting schedule, the expiration date

as of the date hereof Parent does not have and is not bound by any outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements of any
character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of Parent Common
Stock or any other equity security of Parent or any securities representing
the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares of Parent Common Stock
or any other equity security of Parent. Assuming the receipt of all necessary
approvals from Parent's shareholders with respect to the Parent Shareholder
Matters, the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
Merger will be duly authorized and validly issued and, at the Effective Time,
all such shares will be fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof.

of all Liens, and all of such shares or other equity interests are duly
authorized and validly issued, are (if applicable) fully paid and

attaching to the ownership thereof. No Subsidiary of Parent has or is bound
by any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, calls,
commitments or agreements of any character with any party that is not a
direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent calling for the purchase or issuance
of any shares of capital stock or any other equity interest of such
Subsidiary or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity interests of such
Subsidiary. The authorized capital stock of the Parent's Bank consists of one
share of common stock. There is one share of the Parent's Bank's common stock
outstanding; such share is owned by Parent.

adopted by the Board of Directors of Parent and the Parent's
shareholders. With respect to each grant of Parent Stock Options and Parent
Restricted Shares, (i) each such grant was duly authorized no later than the
date on which the grant was by its terms to be effective by all necessary
action, including, as applicable, approval by the Board of Directors of
Parent (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof) or a duly
authorized delegate thereof, and any required shareholder approval by the

otherwise coordinated the grant of Parent Stock Options or Parent Restricted

registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be
made with respect thereto, that they were required to file since December 31,
2010 with (i) the FRB, (ii) the OCC, (iii) the FDIC and (iv) any other bank
regulator that regulates Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively with
the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC, the "Parent Regulatory Agencies"), and have
paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith. Except
for normal examinations conducted by the Parent Regulatory Agencies in the
regular course of the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and except as
set forth in _Section 4.5(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, no Parent
Regulatory Agency has initiated any proceeding or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, investigation into the business or operations of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries since December 31, 2010 the effect of which is reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or to delay approval of the
Merger or the Bank Merger by any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over
the Merger, the Bank Merger, Parent, the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries or which is reasonably likely to result in such Governmental
Entity's objecting to the Merger or the Bank Merger. There is no unresolved
violation, criticism, or exception by any Parent Regulatory Agency with
respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries the effect of which is reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent or to delay approval of the Merger or the
Bank Merger by any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Merger,
the Bank Merger, Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries or
which is reasonably likely to result in such Governmental Entity's objecting
to the Merger or the Bank Merger.

  



  

(b) Parent has filed all reports, schedules, registration statements,
prospectuses and other documents, together with amendments thereto, required
to be filed with the SEC since December 31, 2009 (the "Parent Reports"). As
of their respective dates of filing with the SEC (or, if amended or
superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of
such subsequent filing), the Parent Reports complied, and each Parent Report
filed subsequent to the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time will
comply, in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank
Act, and did not or will not, as the case may be, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. There are no
outstanding comments from, or unresolved issues raised by, the SEC with
respect to any of the Parent Reports. None of Parent's Subsidiaries is
required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to Sections 13 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act. No executive officer of Parent has failed in any
respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Sections 302
or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and to the Knowledge of Parent no enforcement
action has been initiated by the SEC against Parent or its officers or
directors relating to disclosures contained in any Parent Report.

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and
direct control of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all
means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-
exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be
expected to have a materially adverse effect on the system of
internal accounting controls described in the following sentence. Parent and
its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Parent has designed disclosure
controls and procedures (within the meaning of Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
promulgated under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries is made known to the management of
Parent by others within those entities as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required by the Exchange Act with respect to the Parent Reports. Management
of Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date
hereof, to Parent's auditors and the audit committee of Parent's Board of
Directors (1) any significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
internal controls which could adversely affect in any material respect the
Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and
identify any material weaknesses in internal controls and (2) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parent's internal controls. Parent has no
such significant deficiencies or material weaknesses or allegations of fraud
that have not been remediated to the satisfaction of Parent's auditors and
the audit committee of the Parent's Board of Directors.

  



  

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 4.5(d)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, since January 1, 2010, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any member of Parent's Board of
Directors or executive officer of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has
received any material written complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal
accounting controls.

(collectively, the "Parent Financial Statements"). The consolidated
statements of financial condition of Parent (including the related notes,
where applicable) included within the Parent Financial Statements fairly
present in all material respects, and the consolidated statements of
financial condition of the Parent (including the related notes, where
applicable) to be included or incorporated by reference in the S-4 will
fairly present in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof, and the consolidated
statements of income, changes in shareholders\' equity and cash flows
(including the related notes, where applicable) included within the Parent
Financial Statements fairly present in all material respects, and the
consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders\' equity and cash
flows of Parent (including the related notes, where applicable) to be
included or incorporated by reference in the S-4 will fairly present in all
material respects, the consolidated results of operations, changes in
shareholders' equity and cash flows and the consolidated financial
position of the Parent and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods
therein set forth; each of the Parent Financial Statements (including the
related notes, where applicable) complies, and each of such consolidated
financial statements (including the related notes, where applicable) to be
included or incorporated by reference in the S-4 will comply, with accounting
requirements applicable to financial statements to be included or incorporated
by reference in the S-4 and with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto, including without limitation Regulation S-X; and
each of the Parent Financial Statements (including the related notes, where
applicable) has been, and each of such consolidated financial
statements (including the related notes, where applicable) to be included or
incorporated by reference in the S-4 will be, prepared in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC with respect to financial
statements included on Form 10-Q. Parent has previously made available to the
Company its unaudited consolidated statement of condition as of December 31,
2013 and its unaudited consolidated statement of income for the year ended
December 31, 2013 (the "Parent Unaudited Year-End Financial Statements"). The
Parent Unaudited Year-End Financial Statements, as applicable, (i) fairly
present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent
and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and the consolidated results of
operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries for the year ended December
31, 2013, and (ii) have been prepared in all material respects on the same
basis as the year-end statements of condition and year-end statements of
income included within the Parent Financial Statements. The books and records
of the Parent and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in
accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting
requirements, and reflect only actual transactions.

(b) Except as and to the extent reflected, disclosed or reserved against in
the Parent Financial Statements (including the notes thereto), as of
September 30, 2013, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries had any
liabilities, whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise, material to
the financial condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis
which were required to be so disclosed under GAAP. Since September 30, 2013,
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries have incurred any liabilities
except in the Ordinary Course of Business, except as specifically
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Since September 30, 2013, there has not been any material change in the
internal controls utilized by Parent to assure that its consolidated
financial statements conform with GAAP. Parent is not aware of any
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
such internal controls that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and is
not aware of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves Parent's
management or other employees who have a significant role in such internal
controls.

  



  

(d) ParenteBeard LLP was independent with respect to the Parent and its
Subsidiaries within the meaning of the rules of the applicable bank
regulatory authorities and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board with
respect to the year-end financial statements included within the Parent
Financial Statements. Parent engaged BDO USA LLP to succeed ParenteBeard LLP
as Parent's independent auditors, effective July 8, 2013. BDO USA LLP is
independent with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries within the meaning of
the rules of the applicable bank regulatory authorities and the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Parent's Accounting Firm" shall mean ParenteBeard LLP for all times until its
dismissal by Parent on July 8, 2013 and shall mean BDO USA LLP for all
periods thereafter. The Parent's Accounting Firm is and has been
throughout the periods covered by the Parent Financial Statements a
registered public accounting firm (as defined in Section 2(a)(12) of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). _Section 4.6(d)_ of the Parent's Disclosure Schedule
lists all non-audit services performed by the Parent's Accounting Firm (or
any other of Parent's then independent public accountants) for Parent and its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2010.

  



  

4.7 _Broker_. Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent nor any of their
respective officers or directors has employed any broker or finder or
incurred any liability for any broker\'s fees, commissions or finder\'s fees
in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except that Parent has engaged, and will pay a fee or commission to, Keefe,
Bruyette and Woods, Inc.. (the "Parent Advisory Firm") in accordance with the
terms of a letter agreement between the Parent Advisory Firm and Parent, a
true and complete copy of which has previously been delivered by Parent to the
Company's counsel (with a designation that such copy has been delivered
pursuant to Section 4.7 of the then current draft of this Agreement).

4.10 _Taxes_.

  



  

(a) Except where a failure to file Tax Returns, a failure of any such Tax
Return to be complete and accurate in any respect or the failure to pay any
Tax, individually or in the aggregate, would not be material to the results
of operations or financial condition of Parent and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, (i) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed
(taking into account all available extensions) (and until the Effective Time
will so file) all Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them in all
jurisdictions, (ii) all such Tax Returns are (or, in the case of Tax Returns
to be filed prior to the Effective Time, will be) true and complete in
all respects, and (iii) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have duly and
timely paid (and until the Effective Time will so pay) all Taxes that are
required to be paid by any of them, except with respect to matters contested
in good faith in appropriate proceedings and adequately reserved in the
Parent Financial Statements. The unpaid Taxes of Parent and its Subsidiaries
(x) did not, as of the date of each consolidated statement of condition
included in the Parent Financial Statements, exceed the accruals and
reserves for Tax liabilities (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set
forth on the face of the Parent Financial Statements (rather than in any notes
thereto), and (y) will not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of
time through the Effective Time in accordance with the past custom and
practice of Parent and its Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations with
respect to any material Taxes or, to the extent related to such Taxes, agreed
to any extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency, in
each case to the extent such waiver or agreement is currently in effect.
Except as set forth in _Section 4.10(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule,
the Tax Returns of Parent and its Subsidiaries which have been examined by the
IRS or the appropriate state, local or foreign Tax authority have been
resolved and either no deficiencies were asserted as a result of such
examinations or any asserted deficiencies have been paid in full and reflected
in the Parent Financial Statements. Except as set forth in _Section 4.10(a)_
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, there are no current, pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened actions, audits, or examinations by any
Governmental Entity responsible for the collection or imposition of Taxes
with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any pending judicial Tax
proceedings or any other Tax disputes, assessments or claims. Except as set
forth in _Section 4.10(a)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as of the date
of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
(i) a request for information related to Tax matters, or (ii) a notice of
deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax proposed, asserted or
assessed by any Governmental Entity responsible for the collection or
imposition of Taxes with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent
has made available to the Company true and complete copies of the United
States federal, state, local and foreign income Tax Returns filed by Parent or
its Subsidiaries and all examination reports and statements of deficiency
assessed against or agreed to by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries since
December 31, 2009. There are no material Liens with respect to any Taxes upon
any of Parent's or its Subsidiaries' assets, other than Permitted Liens. No
claim has ever been made by any Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

since been filed, (ii) is a party to any agreement providing for the
allocation or sharing of Taxes or otherwise has any liability for Taxes of
any person other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, (iii) has issued or assumed
any obligation under Section 279 of the Code, any high yield discount
obligation as described in Section 163(i)(1) of the Code or any registration-

is not in registered form, (iv) is or has been a United States real
property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the
Code, (v) is or has been a member of an affiliated group (within the meaning
of Section 1504(a) of the Code) filing consolidated United States federal
income Tax Returns (other than such a group the common parent of which is or
was Parent), (vi) has been a party to any distribution occurring during the
last three years in which the parties to such distribution treated the
distribution as one to which Section 355 of the Code (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign Law) applied, or (vii) has participated
in or otherwise engaged in any "Reportable Transaction" as defined in Section
6707A(c)(1) of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b).

  



  

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 4.10(c)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, no officer, director, employee or contractor (or former officer,
director, employee or contractor) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is
entitled to now, or will or may be entitled to as a consequence of this
Agreement or the Merger (either alone or in conjunction with any other event),
any payment or benefit from Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which if paid or provided would constitute
an "excess parachute payment", as defined in Section 280G of the Code or
regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(d) Each plan, program, arrangement or contract that constitutes in any part
a nonqualified deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Section
409A of the Code is identified as such in _Section 4.10(d)_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule. The terms of each of Parent's and its Subsidiaries'
"nonqualified deferred compensation plans" subject to Code Section 409A (and
associated U.S. Treasury Department guidance) comply with Code Section 409A
(and associated U.S. Treasury Department guidance) and each
such "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" has been operated in
compliance with Code Section 409A (and associated U.S. Treasury Department
guidance). Each Parent Stock Option has an exercise price that equals or
exceeds the fair market value of a share of Parent Common Stock as of the
date of grant of such Parent Stock Option (and as of any later modification
thereof within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code).

  



  

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to pay, gross up,
or otherwise indemnify any officer, director, employee or contractor for any
Taxes, including potential Taxes imposed under Section 409A or Section 4999 of
the Code. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries have made any payments
to employees that are not deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code and
consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger will not cause any payments to
employees to not be deductible thereunder.

(g) Except as set forth in _Section 4.10(g)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, (i) Parent and its Subsidiaries have complied with all
applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the payment and
withholding of Taxes and have, within the time and in the manner provided by
law, withheld and paid over to the proper Governmental Entities all amounts
required to be so withheld and paid over under applicable laws; and (ii)
Parent and its Subsidiaries have maintained such records in respect to each
transaction, event and item (including as required to support otherwise
allowable deductions and losses) as are required under applicable Tax law,
except where the failure to comply or maintain records under (i) or (ii)
would not be material to the results of operations or financial condition of
Parent and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

Benefit Plan that has subjected or could subject Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate to any tax, fine, penalty or other
liability under the Code or ERISA.

  



  

(f) Each of the Parent Benefit Plans has been operated in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and in compliance with the provisions
of ERISA, the Code, all regulations, rulings and announcements promulgated or
issued thereunder, and all other applicable governmental laws and
regulations. Furthermore, the IRS has issued a favorable determination letter
with respect to each Parent Pension Plan that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code to the effect that the Parent Pension Plan
satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code (taking into account
all changes in qualification requirements under Section 401(a) for which the
applicable "remedial amendment period" under Section 401(b) of the Code has
expired) and no condition or circumstance exists which could reasonably be
expected to disqualify any such plan. Each Parent Pension Plan subject to the
provisions of Section 401(k) or 401(m) of the Code, or both, has been tested
for and has satisfied the requirements of Section 401(k)(3), Section
401(m)(2) and Section 416 of the Code, as applicable, for each of the last
three plan years. There has not been, nor is there likely to be, a partial
termination of any Parent Pension Plan within the meaning of Section 411(d)(3)
of the Code. None of the assets of any Parent Pension Plan are invested in or
consist of Parent Common Stock.

solicit or knowingly encourage or facilitate inquiries or proposals with
respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any

with, any person relating to, any Company Acquisition Proposal; provided that
in the event that, prior to the time that the Company's shareholders'
approval of the Company Shareholder Matters (the "Company Shareholder
Approval") is obtained but not after, (1) the Company receives, after the
execution of this Agreement, an unsolicited bona fide Company Acquisition
Proposal from a person other than Parent, and (2) the Company's Board
of Directors concludes in good faith (A) that, after consulting with its

Proposal or would reasonably be likely to result in a Company Superior
Proposal and (B) that, after considering the advice of outside counsel,
failure to take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to the Company's shareholders under applicable Law, the Company may, and may
permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries' representatives to,
furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information or data and participate
in negotiations or discussions with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;
provided that prior to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be
provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso, it shall have entered into an

"Confidentiality Agreement") and any non-public information provided to any
person given access to nonpublic information shall have previously been

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the date of the Company Shareholders
Meeting, the Company's Board of Directors may take any of the actions
specified in items (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence (a
"Company Subsequent Determination") after the fourth (4th) Business Day
following Parent's receipt of a written notice (the "Notice of Superior
Proposal") from the Company (A) advising that the Company's Board of
Directors has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written Company Acquisition
Proposal that it received (that did not result from a breach of this Section
5.3 or from an action by a representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries
that would have been such a breach if committed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries) constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being understood that the
Company shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal in
respect of any revised Superior Proposal from such third party or its
Affiliates that the Company proposes to accept), (B) specifying the material
terms and conditions of, and the identity of the party making, such Superior
Proposal, and (C) containing an unredacted copy of the relevant

that the Board of Directors of the Company determines, in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, results
in the applicable Company Acquisition Proposal no longer being a Superior
Proposal and (B) the Company's Board of Directors reasonably determines in
good faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure to take
such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company's
shareholders under applicable Law and that such Company Acquisition Proposal
is a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal has been made and has not
been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal after taking into
account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that are committed to
in writing by Parent pursuant to this Section 5.3(b).

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or modifying of the
Company Board Recommendation or the making of a Company Subsequent
Determination by the Company's Board of Directors shall not change the
approval of the Company's Board of Directors for purposes of causing any
takeover Laws (or comparable provisions of any certificate of incorporation,
by-law or agreement) to be inapplicable to this Agreement, the Voting
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the
Merger.

impediment under any applicable Law so as to enable the Closing to occur as
soon as possible; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall require the Company or Parent to take any actions specified in this

Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition.

  



  

(c) Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all
information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the S-4, any filing

the Exchange Act and any other statement, filing, notice or application made
by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the

extent practicable each will consult with the other on, in each case subject
to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, all

reasonable interest, all to the extent reasonably requested by the Party
seeking such access. However, neither Party shall be required to provide
access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would
violate or prejudice the rights of any customer, would contravene any Law or
Order or would waive any privilege. The Parties will use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain waivers of any such restriction (other than
waivers of the attorney-client privilege) and in any event make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

6.7 _Employee Benefit Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall cooperate to determine the manner in which their respective
employment benefit plans shall be integrated subsequent to the Effective Time
(it being understood that inclusion of specific employees in specific plans
may occur at different times with respect to different plans). With respect to
any such plan, other than an employee pension plan as such term is defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA, for purposes of determining eligibility
to participate, service with the Company, Parent and their respective
Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent that such entities
provide past service credit) shall be treated as service with the Surviving
Corporation and the Surviving Bank. The Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each such plan that is a group health plan to
waive pre-existing condition limitations applicable to their employees (to
the same extent such limitations were satisfied immediately prior to the
Closing).

  



  

6.8 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) For a period commencing as of the Effective Time and ending six years
after the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by Law, Parent shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time,
a director or officer of the Company, the Company's Bank, Parent or Parent's
Bank or who serves or has served at the request of the Company, the Company's
Bank, Parent or Parent's Bank as a director or officer with any other person
(collectively, the "Indemnitees") against any and all claims, damages,
liabilities, losses, costs, charges, expenses (including, subject to the
provisions of this Section 6.8, reasonable costs of investigation and the
reasonable fees and disbursements of legal counsel and other advisers and
experts as incurred), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement, asserted against, incurred by or imposed upon any Indemnitee by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the
Company, the Company's Bank, Parent or Parent's Bank or serves or has served
at the request of the Company, the Company's Bank, Parent or Parent's Bank as
a director or officer with any other person, in connection with, arising out
of or relating to (i) any threatened, pending or completed claim, action, suit
or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative),
including, without limitation, any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings
or investigations by or on behalf of or in the right of or against the
Company, the Company's Bank, Parent or Parent's Bank or any of their
Affiliates, or by any former or present shareholder of the Company or Parent
(each a Claim" and collectively, "Claims"), including, without limitation,
any Claim that is based upon, arises out of or in any way relates to the
Merger, the Bank Merger, the Proxy Statement, this Agreement, any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Indemnitee\'s service as a
member of the Board of Directors of the Company, Parent or their respective
Subsidiaries or of any committee thereof, the events leading up to the
execution of this Agreement, any statement, recommendation or solicitation
made in connection therewith or related thereto and any breach of any duty in
connection with any of the foregoing, or (ii) the enforcement of the
obligations of Parent set forth in this Section 6.8, in each case to the
fullest extent that the Company or Parent would have been permitted under its
certificate of incorporation and by-laws in effect as of the date hereof (and
Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred due to clauses (i) or (ii)
above to the fullest extent so permitted).

  



  

   

-94- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Any Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.8 shall
promptly notify Parent in writing upon learning of any Claim, but the
failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent of any liability it may have to
such Indemnitee except to the extent that such failure prejudices Parent. In
the event of any Claim as to which indemnification under this Section 6.8 is
applicable, (x) Parent shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and
Parent shall not be liable to the applicable Indemnitee for any legal expenses
of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof, except that if Parent
elects not to assume such defense, or counsel for such Indemnitee advises
that there are issues that raise conflicts of interest between Parent and
such Indemnitee, such Indemnitee may retain counsel satisfactory to such
Indemnitee, and Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for such Indemnitee as statements therefor are received; provided,
however, that Parent shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.8 to pay
for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnitees in any jurisdiction with
respect to a matter unless the use of one counsel for multiple Indemnitees
would present such counsel with a conflict of interest that is not waived,
and (y) the Indemnitees will cooperate in the defense of any such matter.
Parent shall not be liable for the settlement of any claim, action or
proceeding hereunder unless such settlement is effected with its prior written
consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.8, Parent
shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee when and if a
court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final and nonappealable, that
the indemnification of such Indemnitee in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable Law or public policy.

  



  

(b) Parent shall cause the persons serving as officers and directors of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of
six years from the Effective Time by the directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy presently maintained by the Company (provided that Parent
may substitute therefor policies having substantially the same or greater
coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not
materially less advantageous than such policy or single premium tail
coverage with policy limits substantially the same or greater than the
Company\'s existing annual coverage limits) with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and
directors in their capacity as such; provided, however, that the dollar
amount of the premiums payable by Parent for such insurance shall be subject
to such customary limitations (consistent with the limitations to be
developed under Section 6.8(c)) as shall be reasonably determined by the
Company and Parent prior to the Effective Time. If the premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed the limitations so agreed upon, then
Parent may satisfy its obligations under this Section 6.8(b) by causing to be
maintained policies which, in Parent's good faith determination, provide the
maximum coverage available at an annual premium consistent with such
limitations. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with Parent in the event that Parent determines to acquire, or
directs the Company to acquire, tail insurance with respect to the Company's
existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy.

(c) Parent shall cause the persons serving as officers and directors of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of
six years from the Effective Time by the directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy presently maintained by Parent (provided that Parent may
substitute therefor policies having substantially the same or greater coverage
and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not materially less
advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and
directors in their capacity as such; provided, however, that the dollar
amount of the premiums payable by Parent for such insurance shall be subject
to such customary limitations (consistent with the limitations to be
developed under Section 6.8(b)) as shall be reasonably determined by the
Company and Parent prior to the Effective Time. If the premiums for such
insurance would at any time exceed the limitations so agreed upon, then Parent
may satisfy its obligations under this Section 6.8(c) by causing to be
maintained policies which, in Parent's good faith determination, provide the
maximum coverage available at an annual premium consistent with such
limitations.

  



  

(d) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnitees and his or her heirs and
representatives.

  



  

6.9 _Additional Arrangements_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation considers or is advised that any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Constituent Corporations acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of each of the Constituent
Corporations or otherwise, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of the
Constituent Corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as
may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.

6.10 _Parent Dividends_. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement, Parent shall not increase the dollar amount
of its quarterly cash dividend beyond $0.075 per share.

  



  

6.11 _Employee Severance and other Employment Matters_.

  



  

(a) Although, except as otherwise provided for herein, the Surviving
Corporation shall be under no obligation to retain any employee of Company,
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, Parent will, as of the Effective
Date, make a good faith effort to offer, and cause its Subsidiaries to offer,
continued employment to each employee of the Company, Parent and their
respective Subsidiaries, whether in their current position or in another
position with the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, subject to the
Surviving Corporation's employment policies and procedures and the needs of
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the
forgoing, any person who is serving as an employee of either the Company,
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries as of the date hereof
whose employment is terminated or substantially adversely modified by the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries during the period from the
Effective Time until the one year anniversary of the Effective Time (unless
such termination or substantial adverse modification of employment is for
cause or such employee is a party to an employment agreement or other
arrangement that provides for severance) shall, unless otherwise set forth in
an agreement referenced in Section 6.11(b) of this Agreement, be entitled
to severance payments from the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries in
accordance with the severance formula set forth in _Section 6.11(a)_ of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule. For purposes of this Section 6.11, "cause" shall
mean termination or substantial adverse modification because of the
employee's personal dishonesty, incompetence, willful misconduct, breach of
fiduciary duty involving personal profit, intentional failure to perform
stated duties or willful violation of any Law (other than traffic violations
or similar minor offenses). For purposes of this Section 6.11, an employee's
employment shall be deemed to be substantially adversely modified if there
has been a substantial diminution in such employee\'s compensation or
the overall importance of such employee's position, as determined by
balancing (i) any increase or decrease in the scope of such employee's
responsibilities against (ii) any increase or decrease in the relative extent
of the business, activities or functions (or portions thereof) for which such
employee has and had responsibility; provided, however, that neither a change
of such employee's title or a change in the employer's organizational
hierarchy, without a decrease in relative responsibility balanced as
set forth above, shall be considered a substantial diminution of overall
importance.

  



  

(b) Parent shall honor, adopt and perform under and/or permit the Company to
honor and perform under those certain agreements set forth in _Section
6.11(b)_  of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Parent shall honor and perform
under those certain agreements set forth in _Section 6.11(b)_  of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule

6.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each Party shall give prompt notice
to the other Party of (a) any event, condition, change, occurrence, act or
omission that causes any of its representations hereunder to cease to be true
in all material respects (or, with respect to any such representation that is
qualified as to materiality, causes such representation to cease to be true in
all respects); and (b) any event, condition, change, occurrence, act or
omission that individually or in the aggregate has, or that, so far
as reasonably can be foreseen at the time of its occurrence, is reasonably
likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on such Party. Each of the Company
and Parent shall give prompt notice to the other Party of any notice or other
communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such third
party is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

  



  

6.13 _Certain Matters, Certain Revaluations, Changes and Adjustments_.
Notwithstanding that each Party believes that it and its Subsidiaries have
established all reserves and taken all provisions for possible loan losses
required by GAAP and applicable Laws, the Parties recognize that they may
have different loan, accrual and reserve policies (including loan
classifications and levels of reserves for possible loan losses). Between the
date hereof and the Effective Time, as part of a plan of integration for the
Merger and the Bank Merger, the Parties shall determine the steps that will
be required to conform their respective loan, litigation and real estate
valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and levels of
reserves) as of the Effective Time.

  



  

6.14. _Failure to Fulfill Conditions_. In the event that Parent or the
Company determines that a material condition to its obligation to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby cannot be fulfilled on or prior to the
Cut-off Date and that it will not waive that condition, it will promptly
notify the other Party. The Company and Parent will promptly inform the other
of any facts applicable to the Company or Parent, respectively, or their
respective directors, officers or Subsidiaries, that would be reasonably
likely to prevent or materially delay approval of the Merger or the Bank
Merger by any Governmental Entity or that would otherwise prevent or
materially delay completion of the Merger or the Bank Merger. Any information
so provided shall be retained by the receiving Party in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

6.15. _Printing and Mailing Expenses_. Parent, in reasonable consultation
with the Company, shall (subject to Section 9.3 of this Agreement) make all
arrangements with respect to the printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement.

  



  

6.16 _Pre-Closing Delivery of Financial Statements_. Prior to the Closing,
the Company shall deliver to Parent such consolidated financial statements of
the Company as Parent shall reasonably request in order to enable Parent to
comply with its reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, together with
an executed report of the Company's outside auditors with respect to all such
financial statements that have been audited. Such report shall be in form and
substance satisfactory to the Parent _._ The financial statements delivered
pursuant to this Section 6.16 shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and
shall conform to all provisions of the SEC's Regulation S-X, such that such
financial statements are suitable for filing by Parent with the SEC in
response to Items 2 and 9 of the SEC's Current Report on Form 8-K _._
Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause its outside
auditors to deliver to the Parent an executed consent, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Parent and suitable for filing by the Parent with the
SEC, which consent shall authorize the Parent to file with the SEC the report

prior to the Effective Time, either (i) a written opinion from its counsel
(based upon an affidavit from the Company that is approved by Parent) that the
transactions contemplated by, or the properties subject to, this Agreement
are not subject to the requirements of ISRA, or (ii) a Remediation
Certification (in form and substance satisfactory to Parent) prepared by a
New Jersey Licensed Site Remediation Professional ("LSRP") pursuant to ISRA
authorizing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement prior to the issuance of any "Response Action Outcome" as such term
is defined under ISRA and SRRA, or (iii) an approval of a Remedial Action
Workplan (in form and substance satisfactory to the Parent) , or (iv)
issuance of a waiver or other approval by the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection ("NJDEP") pursuant to N.J.A.C. 13:1K-11.2 through
11.8 with respect to each property in New Jersey that the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries owns or operates, in each case to the extent that such
property renders the provisions of ISRA applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company will obtain and maintain a
"Remediation Funding Source," as such term is defined under BCSRA, or other
financial assurance in form and amount approvable by the LSRP and the NJDEP
as required in furtherance of the Company's obligations under this Section
6.17.

  



  

6.18 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, to the extent
permitted by Law without expense to the Parties, the Parties will
use commercially reasonable efforts to take such steps as may be reasonably
necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Company Common
Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of shares of

required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and contemplated
by the Bank Merger Agreement shall have been obtained without the imposition
of any term or condition that would, in the reasonable judgment of Parent and
the Company, impair, in any material respect, the value of the Merger to the

it of the Merger.

Parent and the Company shall deliver to Lowenstein Sandler LLP representation
letters, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to

provided in Section 6.8 of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person other than
Parent and the Company any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature under or by reason of this Agreement. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. In certain instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
between the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of
the knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently, persons other than the
Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date
of this Agreement or as of any other date.

applicable record date, which shall be the 15th calendar day
immediately preceding such Dividend Payment Date or such other record date
fixed by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board
of Directors that is not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such
Dividend Payment Date (each, a " _Dividend Record Date_ "). Any such day that
is a Dividend Record Date shall be a Dividend Record Date whether or not such
day is a Business Day.

  



  

Holders of Designated Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividends,
whether payable in cash, securities or other property, other than
dividends (if any) declared and payable on Designated Preferred Stock as
specified in this Section 3 (subject to the other provisions of the
Certificate of Designations).

  



  

(b) _Priority of Dividends_. So long as any share of Designated Preferred
Stock remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution shall be declared or
paid on the Common Stock or any other shares of Junior Stock (other than
dividends payable solely in shares of Common Stock) or Parity Stock, subject
to the immediately following paragraph in the case of Parity Stock, and no
Common Stock, Junior Stock or Parity Stock shall be, directly or indirectly,
purchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired for consideration by the
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries unless all accrued and unpaid
dividends for all past Dividend Periods, including the latest
completed Dividend Period (including, if applicable as provided in Section
3(a) above, dividends on such amount), on all outstanding shares of
Designated Preferred Stock have been or are contemporaneously declared and
paid in full (or have been declared and a sum sufficient for the payment
thereof has been set aside for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Designated Preferred Stock on the applicable record date). The foregoing
limitation shall not apply to (i) redemptions, purchases or other acquisitions
of shares of Common Stock or other Junior Stock in connection with the
administration of any employee benefit plan in the ordinary course of
business (including purchases to offset the Share Dilution Amount (as defined
below) pursuant to a publicly announced repurchase plan) and consistent with
past practice, _provided_ that any purchases to offset the Share Dilution
Amount shall in no event exceed the Share Dilution Amount; (ii) purchases or
other acquisitions by a broker-dealer subsidiary of the Corporation solely
for the purpose of market-making, stabilization or customer facilitation
transactions in Junior Stock or Parity Stock in the ordinary course of its
business; (iii) purchases by a broker-dealer subsidiary of the Corporation of
capital stock of the Corporation for resale pursuant to an offering by the
Corporation of such capital stock underwritten by such broker-dealer
subsidiary; (iv) any dividends or distributions of rights or Junior Stock in
connection with a stockholders' rights plan or any redemption or repurchase
of rights pursuant to any stockholders' rights plan; (v) the acquisition by
the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries of record ownership in Junior
Stock or Parity Stock for the beneficial ownership of any other persons
(other than the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries), including as trustees
or custodians; and (vi) the exchange or conversion of Junior Stock for or
into other Junior Stock or of Parity Stock for or into other Parity Stock
(with the same or lesser aggregate liquidation amount) or Junior Stock, in
each case, solely to the extent required pursuant to binding
contractual agreements entered into prior to the Signing Date or any
subsequent agreement for the accelerated exercise, settlement or
exchange thereof for Common Stock. " _Share Dilution Amount_ " means the
increase in the number of diluted shares outstanding (determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States,
and as measured from the date of the Corporation's consolidated financial
statements most recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
prior to the Original Issue Date) resulting from the grant, vesting or
exercise of equity-based compensation to employees and equitably adjusted for
any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, reclassification or
similar transaction.

When dividends are not paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for payment
thereof set aside for the benefit of the holders thereof on the applicable
record date) on any Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock
having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a
dividend payment date falling within a Dividend Period related to such
Dividend Payment Date) in full upon Designated Preferred Stock and any shares
of Parity Stock, all dividends declared on Designated Preferred Stock and all
such Parity Stock and payable on such Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case
of Parity Stock having dividend payment dates different from the Dividend
Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date falling within the Dividend Period
related to such Dividend Payment Date) shall be declared _pro rata_ so that
the respective amounts of such dividends declared shall bear the same ratio
to each other as all accrued and unpaid dividends per share on the shares of
Designated Preferred Stock (including, if applicable as provided in Section
3(a) above, dividends on such amount) and all Parity Stock payable on such
Dividend Payment Date (or, in the case of Parity Stock having dividend payment
dates different from the Dividend Payment Dates, on a dividend payment date
falling within the Dividend Period related to such Dividend Payment Date)
(subject to their having been declared by the Board of Directors or a duly
authorized committee of the Board of Directors out of legally available funds
and including, in the case of Parity Stock that bears cumulative dividends,
all accrued but unpaid dividends) bear to each other. If the Board of
Directors or a duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors determines
not to pay any dividend or a full dividend on a Dividend Payment Date, the
Corporation will provide written notice to the holders of Designated
Preferred Stock prior to such Dividend Payment Date.

  



  

Subject to the foregoing, and not otherwise, such dividends (payable in cash,
securities or other property) as may be determined by the Board of
Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors may be
declared and paid on any securities, including Common Stock and other Junior
Stock, from time to time out of any funds legally available for such payment,
and holders of Designated Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to
participate in any such dividends.

Section 4. _Liquidation Rights_.

  



  

(a) _Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation_. In the event of any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation,
whether voluntary or involuntary, holders of Designated Preferred Stock shall
be entitled to receive for each share of Designated Preferred Stock, out of
the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof (whether capital or surplus)
available for distribution to stockholders of the Corporation, subject to the
rights of any creditors of the Corporation, before any distribution of such
assets or proceeds is made to or set aside for the holders of Common Stock
and any other stock of the Corporation ranking junior to Designated
Preferred Stock as to such distribution, payment in full in an amount equal
to the sum of (i) the Liquidation Amount per share and (ii) the amount of any
accrued and unpaid dividends (including, if applicable as provided in Section
3(a) above, dividends on such amount), whether or not declared, to the date
of payment (such amounts collectively, the " _Liquidation Preference_ ").

  



  

(b) _Partial Payment_. If in any distribution described in Section 4(a) above
the assets of the Corporation or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay
in full the amounts payable with respect to all outstanding shares of
Designated Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable with respect
of any other stock of the Corporation ranking equally with Designated
Preferred Stock as to such distribution, holders of Designated Preferred
Stock and the holders of such other stock shall share ratably in any such
distribution in proportion to the full respective distributions to which they
are entitled.

  



  

(c) _Residual Distributions_. If the Liquidation Preference has been paid in
full to all holders of Designated Preferred Stock and the corresponding
amounts payable with respect of any other stock of the Corporation ranking
equally with Designated Preferred Stock as to such distribution has been paid
in full, the holders of other stock of the Corporation shall be entitled to
receive all remaining assets of the Corporation (or proceeds thereof)
according to their respective rights and preferences.

  



  

(d) _Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Not Liquidation_. For purposes
of this Section 4, the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with
any other corporation or other entity, including a merger or consolidation in
which the holders of Designated Preferred Stock receive cash, securities or
other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange (for cash,
securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Corporation, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 5. _Redemption_.

  



  

(a) _Optional Redemption_. Except as provided below, the Designated Preferred
Stock may not be redeemed prior to the first Dividend Payment Date falling

first Dividend Payment Date falling on or after the third anniversary of the
Original Issue Date, the Corporation, at its option, subject to the approval
of the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency, may redeem, in whole or in part,
at any time and from time to time, out of funds legally available therefor,
the shares of Designated Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, upon notice
given as provided in Section 5(c) below, at a redemption price equal to the
sum of (i) the Liquidation Amount per share and (ii) except as otherwise
provided below, any accrued and unpaid dividends (including, if applicable as
provided in Section 3(a) above, dividends on such amount) (regardless of
whether any dividends are actually declared) to, but excluding, the date

Federal Banking Agency, may redeem, in whole or in part, at any time and from
time to time, the shares of Designated Preferred Stock at the time
outstanding, upon notice given as provided in Section 5(c) below, at a
redemption price equal to the sum of (i) the Liquidation Amount per share and
(ii) except as otherwise provided below, any accrued and unpaid dividends
(including, if applicable as provided in Section 3(a) above, dividends on
such amount) (regardless of whether any dividends are actually declared) to,
but excluding, the date fixed for redemption; _provided _ that (x) the
Corporation (or any successor by Business Combination) has received aggregate
gross proceeds of not less than the Minimum Amount (plus the "Minimum Amount"
as defined in the relevant certificate of designations for each other
outstanding series of preferred stock of such successor that was
originally issued to the United States Department of the Treasury (the
"Successor Preferred Stock") in connection with the Troubled Asset Relief
Program Capital Purchase Program) from one or more Qualified Equity Offerings
(including Qualified Equity Offerings of such successor), and (y) the
aggregate redemption price of the Designated Preferred Stock (and any
Successor Preferred Stock) redeemed pursuant to this paragraph may not exceed
the aggregate net cash proceeds received by the Corporation (or any
successor by Business Combination) from such Qualified Equity Offerings
(including Qualified Equity Offerings of such successor).

  



  

The redemption price for any shares of Designated Preferred Stock shall be
payable on the redemption date to the holder of such shares against
surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing such shares to the Corporation or
its agent. Any declared but unpaid dividends payable on a redemption date
that occurs subsequent to the Dividend Record Date for a Dividend Period shall
not be paid to the holder entitled to receive the redemption price on the
redemption date, but rather shall be paid to the holder of record of the
redeemed shares on such Dividend Record Date relating to the Dividend Payment
Date as provided in Section 3 above.

  



  

(b) _No Sinking Fund_. The Designated Preferred Stock will not be subject to
any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. Holders
of Designated Preferred Stock will have no right to require redemption or
repurchase of any shares of Designated Preferred Stock.

  



  

(c) _Notice of Redemption_. Notice of every redemption of shares of
Designated Preferred Stock shall be given by first class mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed at
their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the
Corporation. Such mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days
before the date fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this
Subsection shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or
not the holder receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by
mail, or any defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of
shares of Designated Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not
affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other
shares of Designated Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
shares of Designated Preferred Stock are issued in book-entry form through
The Depository Trust Corporation or any other similar facility, notice of
redemption may be given to the holders of Designated Preferred Stock at such
time and in any manner permitted by such facility. Each notice of redemption
given to a holder shall state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the number of
shares of Designated Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the
shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to be
redeemed from such holder; (3) the redemption price; and (4) the place or

(d) _Partial Redemption_. In case of any redemption of part of the shares of
Designated Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be redeemed
shall be selected either _pro rata_ or in such other manner as the Board of
Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof may determine to be fair and
equitable. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Board of Directors or a duly
authorized committee thereof shall have full power and authority to
prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of Designated Preferred
Stock shall be redeemed from time to time. If fewer than all the shares
represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued
representing the unredeemed shares without charge to the holder thereof.

  



  

(e) _Effectiveness of Redemption_. If notice of redemption has been duly
given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all
funds necessary for the redemption have been deposited by the Corporation, in
trust for the _pro rata_ benefit of the holders of the shares called for
redemption, with a bank or trust company doing business in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York, and having a capital and surplus of at least
$500 million and selected by the Board of Directors, so as to be and continue
to be available solely therefor, then, notwithstanding that any certificate
for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for
cancellation, on and after the redemption date dividends shall cease to accrue
on all shares so called for redemption, all shares so called for redemption
shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such
shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except
only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on such
redemption from such bank or trust company, without interest. Any funds
unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the
extent permitted by law, be released to the Corporation, after which time the
holders of the shares so called for redemption shall look only to the
Corporation for payment of the redemption price of such shares.

  



  

(f) _Status of Redeemed Shares_. Shares of Designated Preferred Stock that
are redeemed, repurchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall

Preferred Stock).

(a) _General_. The holders of Designated Preferred Stock shall not have any
voting rights except as set forth below or as otherwise from time to time
required by law.

  



  

(b) _Preferred Stock Directors_. Whenever, at any time or times, dividends
payable on the shares of Designated Preferred Stock have not been paid for an
aggregate of six quarterly Dividend Periods or more, whether or not
consecutive, the authorized number of directors of the Corporation shall
automatically be increased by two and the holders of the Designated Preferred
Stock shall have the right, with holders of shares of any one or more other
classes or series of Voting Parity Stock outstanding at the time, voting
together as a class, to elect two directors (hereinafter the _"_
_Preferred Directors_ _" _and each a _"_ _Preferred Director_ _"_ ) to fill
such newly created directorships at the Corporation's next annual meeting of
stockholders (or at a special meeting called for that purpose prior to such
next annual meeting) and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders
until all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past Dividend Periods,
including the latest completed Dividend Period (including, if applicable as
provided in Section 3(a) above, dividends on such amount), on all outstanding
shares of Designated Preferred Stock have been declared and paid in full at
which time such right shall terminate with respect to the Designated
Preferred Stock, except as herein or by law expressly provided, subject
to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the
character above mentioned; _provided_ that it shall be a qualification for
election for any Preferred Director that the election of such Preferred
Director shall not cause the Corporation to violate any corporate governance
requirements of any securities exchange or other trading facility on
which securities of the Corporation may then be listed or traded that listed
or traded companies must have a majority of independent directors. Upon any
termination of the right of the holders of shares of Designated Preferred
Stock and Voting Parity Stock as a class to vote for directors as provided
above, the Preferred Directors shall cease to be qualified as directors, the
term of office of all Preferred Directors then in office shall terminate
immediately and the authorized number of directors shall be reduced by the
number of Preferred Directors elected pursuant hereto. Any Preferred Director
may be removed at any time, with or without cause, and any vacancy created
thereby may be filled, only by the affirmative vote of the holders a majority
of the shares of Designated Preferred Stock at the time outstanding voting
separately as a class together with the holders of shares of Voting Parity
Stock, to the extent the voting rights of such holders described above are
then exercisable. If the office of any Preferred Director becomes vacant for
any reason other than removal from office as aforesaid, the remaining
Preferred Director may choose a successor who shall hold office for the
unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.

  



  

(c) _Class Voting Rights as to Particular Matters_. So long as any shares of
Designated Preferred Stock are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or
consent of stockholders required by law or by the Charter, the vote or consent
of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the shares of Designated Preferred
Stock at the time outstanding, voting as a separate class, given in person or

merger or consolidation with respect to which the Corporation is not the
surviving or resulting entity, are converted into or exchanged for preference
securities of the surviving or resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and
(y) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the
case may be, have such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and
limitations and restrictions thereof, taken as a whole, as are not materially
less favorable to the holders thereof than the rights,
preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions
thereof, of Designated Preferred Stock immediately prior to
such consummation, taken as a whole;

  



  

 _provided_ ,  _however_ , that for all purposes of this Section 7(c),
any increase in the amount of the authorized Preferred Stock, including any
increase in the authorized amount of Designated Preferred Stock necessary to

persons prior to the Signing Date, or the creation and issuance, or an
increase in the authorized or issued amount, whether pursuant to preemptive or
similar rights or otherwise, of any other series of Preferred Stock, or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any other
series of Preferred Stock, ranking equally with and/or junior to Designated
Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends (whether such

upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation will not be
deemed to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting

of outstanding shares of the Designated Preferred Stock.

  



  

(d) _Changes after Provision for Redemption_. No vote or consent of the
holders of Designated Preferred Stock shall be required pursuant to

ninth (9th) Dividend Period and the Baseline; and 
     |   | 
     |   | (ii) zero (0) at all other times. 
  



  

(ss) " _Voting Parity Stock_ " means, with regard to any matter as to which
the holders of Designated Preferred Stock are entitled to vote as specified
in Section 7(d) of these Standard Provisions that form a part of the
Certificate of Designation, any and all series of Parity Stock upon which
like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable with respect to
such matter.

  



  

Section 3. _Dividends_.

  



  

(a) _Rate_.

  



  

(i) The " _Applicable Dividend Rate_ " shall be determined as follows:

  



   | (1)| With respect to the Initial Dividend Period, the Applicable
Dividend Rate shall be five percent (5 %). 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

-19- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



   | (2)| With respect to each of the second (2nd) through the tenth (10th)
Dividend Periods, inclusive (in each case, the " _Current Period_ "), the
Applicable Dividend Rate shall be: 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(A) (x) the applicable rate set forth in column "A" of the table in Section
3(a)(iii), based on the Percentage Change in QSBL between the Dividend Period
that was two Dividend Periods prior to the Current Period (the " _Dividend
Reference Period_ ") and the Baseline, multiplied by (y) the Qualifying
Portion Percentage; plus

  



  

(B) (x) five percent (5%) multiplied by (y) the Non-Qualifying Portion
Percentage.

  



   | | In each such case, the Applicable Dividend Rate shall be determined
at the time the Issuer delivers a complete and accurate Supplemental Report
to Treasury with respect to the Dividend Reference Period. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (3)| With respect to the eleventh (11th) through the eighteenth (18th)
Dividend Periods, inclusive, and that portion of the nineteenth (19th)
Dividend Period prior to, but not including, the four and one half (4½) year
anniversary of the Original Issue Date, the Applicable Dividend Rate shall
be: 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(A) (x) the applicable rate set forth in column "B" of the table in Section
3(a)(iii), based on the Percentage Change in QSBL between the ninth (9th)
Dividend Period and the Baseline, multiplied by (y) the Qualifying Portion
Percentage, calculated as of the last day of the ninth (9th) Dividend Period;
plus

  



  

(B) (x) five percent (5%) multiplied by (y) the Non-Qualifying Portion
Percentage, calculated as of the last day of the ninth (9th) Dividend Period.

  



   | | In such case, the Applicable Dividend Rate shall be determined at
the time the Issuer delivers a complete and accurate Supplemental Report to
Treasury with respect to the ninth (9th) Dividend Period. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (4)| With respect to (A) that portion of the nineteenth (19th)
Dividend Period beginning on the four and one half (4½) year anniversary of
the Original Issue Date and (B) all Dividend Periods thereafter, the
Applicable Dividend Rate shall be nine percent (9%). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (5)| Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Issuer
fails to submit a Supplemental Report that is due during any of the second
(2nd) through tenth (10th) Dividend Periods on or before the sixtieth (60th)
day of such Dividend Period, the Issuer's QSBL for the Dividend Period that
would have been covered by such Supplemental Report shall be zero (0) for
purposes hereof. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

-20- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



   | (6)| Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but subject to
Section 3(a)(i)(5) above, if the Issuer fails to submit the Supplemental
Report that is due during the tenth (10th) Dividend Period, the Issuer's QSBL
for such Dividend Period shall be zero (0) for purposes of calculating the
Applicable Dividend Rate pursuant to Section 3(a)(i)(3) and (4). The
Applicable Dividend Rate shall be re-determined effective as of the first day
of the calendar quarter following the date such failure is remedied, provided
it is remedied prior to the four and one half (4½) anniversary of the Original
Issue Date. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (7)| Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Issuer
fails to submit any of the certificates required by Sections 3.1(d)(ii) or
3.1(d)(iii) of the Definitive Agreement when and as required thereby, the
Issuer's QSBL shall be zero (0) for purposes of calculating the Applicable
Dividend Rate pursuant to Section 3(a)(i)(2) or (3) above until such failure
is remedied. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(ii) The "Percentage Change in Qualified Lending" between any given Dividend
Period and the Baseline shall be the result of the following formula,
expressed as a percentage:

  



     (   | ( QSBL for the Dividend Period - Baseline )  | )  | x 100 
---|---|---|--- 
   Baseline 
  



  

(iii) The following table shall be used for determining the Applicable
Dividend Rate:

  



       | The Applicable Dividend Rate shall be: 
---|--- 
   _If  the Percentage Change in Qualified Lending is:_   | _Column  "A" 
  (each of the 
  2nd - 10th 
  Dividend Periods)_  | _Column  "B" 
  (11th - 18th, and 
  the first part of the 
  19th, Dividend 
  Periods) _ 
   0% or less  | 5%  | 7% 
   More than 0%, but less than 2.5%  | 5%  | 5% 
   2.5% or more, but less than 5%  | 4%  | 4% 
   5% or more, but less than 7.5%  | 3%  | 3% 
   7.5% or more, but less than 10%  | 2%  | 2% 
   10% or more  | 1%  | 1%

(iv) If the Issuer consummates a Business Combination, a purchase of loans or
a purchase of participations in loans and the Designated Preferred Stock
remains outstanding thereafter, then the Baseline shall thereafter be the
"Quarter-End Adjusted Small Business Lending Baseline" set forth on the
Quarterly Supplemental Report (as defined in the Definitive Agreement).

  



  

(b) _Payment_. Holders of Designated Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive, on each share of Designated Preferred Stock if, as and when declared
by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of
Directors, but only out of assets legally available therefor, non-cumulative
cash dividends with respect to:

  



  

(i) each Dividend Period (other than the Initial Dividend Period) at a rate
equal to one-fourth (¼) of the Applicable Dividend Rate with respect to each
Dividend Period on the Liquidation Amount per share of Designated Preferred
Stock, and no more, payable quarterly in arrears on each Dividend Payment
Date; and

  



  

(ii) the Initial Dividend Period, on the first such Dividend Payment Date to
occur at least twenty (20) calendar days after the Original Issue Date, an
amount equal to (A) the Applicable Dividend Rate with respect to the Initial
Dividend Period multiplied by (B) the number of days from the Original Issue
Date to the last day of the Initial Dividend Period (inclusive) divided by
360.

  



  

In the event that any Dividend Payment Date would otherwise fall on a day
that is not a Business Day, the dividend payment due on that date will be
postponed to the next day that is a Business Day and no additional dividends
will accrue as a result of that postponement. For avoidance of doubt,
"payable quarterly in arrears" means that, with respect to any particular
Dividend Period, dividends begin accruing on the first day of such Dividend
Period and are payable on the first day of the next Dividend Period.

  



  

The amount of dividends payable on Designated Preferred Stock on any date
prior to the end of a Dividend Period, and for the initial Dividend Period,
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of four 90-day
quarters, and actual days elapsed over a 90-day quarter.

  



  

Dividends that are payable on Designated Preferred Stock on any Dividend
Payment Date will be payable to holders of record of Designated Preferred
Stock as they appear on the stock register of the Issuer on the applicable
record date, which shall be the 15th calendar day immediately preceding such
Dividend Payment Date or such other record date fixed by the Board of
Directors or any duly authorized committee of the Board of Directors that is
not more than 60 nor less than 10 days prior to such Dividend Payment Date
(each, a " _Dividend Record Date_ "). Any such day that is a Dividend Record
Date shall be a Dividend Record Date whether or not such day is a Business
Day.

  



  

Holders of Designated Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any dividends,
whether payable in cash, securities or other property, other than
dividends (if any) declared and payable on Designated Preferred Stock as
specified in this Section 3 (subject to the other provisions of the
Certificate of Designation).

  



  

   

-22- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) _Non-Cumulative_. Dividends on shares of Designated Preferred Stock shall
be non-cumulative. If the Board of Directors or any duly authorized
committee of the Board of Directors does not declare a dividend on the
Designated Preferred Stock in respect of any Dividend Period:

  



  

(i) the holders of Designated Preferred Stock shall have no right to receive
any dividend for such Dividend Period, and the Issuer shall have no
obligation to pay a dividend for such Dividend Period, whether or not
dividends are declared for any subsequent Dividend Period with respect to the
Designated Preferred Stock; and

  



  

(ii) the Issuer shall, within five (5) calendar days, deliver to the holders
of the Designated Preferred Stock a written notice executed by the Chief
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Issuer stating the
Board of Directors' rationale for not declaring dividends.

  



  

(d) _Priority of Dividends; Restrictions on Dividends_.

  



  

(i) Subject to Sections 3(d)(ii), (iii) and (v) and any restrictions imposed
by the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency or, if applicable, the Issuer's
state bank supervisor (as defined in Section 3(r) of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. § 1813(q)), so long as any share of Designated
Preferred Stock remains outstanding, the Issuer may declare and pay dividends
on the Common Stock, any other shares of Junior Stock, or Parity Stock, in
each case only if (A) after giving effect to such dividend the Issuer's Tier
1 capital would be at least equal to the Tier 1 Dividend Threshold, and (B)
full dividends on all outstanding shares of Designated Preferred Stock for
the most recently completed Dividend Period have been or are contemporaneously
declared and paid.

  



  

(ii) If a dividend is not declared and paid in full on the Designated
Preferred Stock in respect of any Dividend Period, then from the last day of
such Dividend Period until the last day of the third (3rd) Dividend Period
immediately following it, no dividend or distribution shall be declared or
paid on the Common Stock or any other shares of Junior Stock (other than
dividends payable solely in shares of Common Stock) or Parity Stock;
_provided, however_ , that in any such Dividend Period in which a dividend is
declared and paid on the Designated Preferred Stock, dividends may be paid on
Parity Stock to the extent necessary to avoid any material breach of a
covenant by which the Issuer is bound.

  



  

(iii) When dividends have not been declared and paid in full for an aggregate
of four (4) Dividend Periods or more, and during such time the Issuer was not
subject to a regulatory determination that prohibits the declaration and
payment of dividends, the Issuer shall, within five (5) calendar days of each
missed payment, deliver to the holders of the Designated Preferred Stock a
certificate executed by at least a majority of the Board of Directors stating
that the Board of Directors used its best efforts to declare and pay
such dividends in a manner consistent with (A) safe and sound banking
practices and (B) the directors' fiduciary obligations.

  



  

   

-23- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(iv) Subject to the foregoing and Section 3(e) below and not otherwise, such
dividends (payable in cash, securities or other property) as may be
determined by the Board of Directors or any duly authorized committee of the
Board of Directors may be declared and paid on any securities, including
Common Stock and other Junior Stock, from time to time out of any funds
legally available for such payment, and holders of Designated Preferred Stock
shall not be entitled to participate in any such dividends.

  



  

(v) If the Issuer is not Publicly-Traded, then after the tenth (10th)
anniversary of the Signing Date, so long as any share of Designated Preferred
Stock remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution shall be declared or
paid on the Common Stock or any other shares of Junior Stock (other than
dividends payable solely in shares of Common Stock) or Parity Stock.

  



  

(e) _Special Lending Incentive Fee Related to CPP_. If Treasury held
Previously Acquired Preferred Shares immediately prior to the Original
Issue Date and the Issuer did not apply to Treasury to redeem such Previously
Acquired Preferred Shares prior to December 16, 2010, and if the Issuer's
Supplemental Report with respect to the ninth (9th) Dividend Period reflects
an amount of Qualified Small Business Lending that is less than or equal to
the Baseline (or if the Issuer fails to timely file a Supplemental Report with
respect to the ninth (9th) Dividend Period), then beginning on April 1, 2014
and on all Dividend Payment Dates thereafter ending on April 1, 2016, the
Issuer shall pay to the Holders of Designated Preferred Stock, on each share
of Designated Preferred Stock, but only out of assets legally available
therefor, a fee equal to 0.5% of the Liquidation Amount per share of
Designated Preferred Stock (" _CPP Lending Incentive Fee_ "). All references
in Section 3(d) to "dividends" on the Designated Preferred Stock shall be
deemed to include the CPP Lending Incentive Fee.

  



  

Section 4. _Liquidation Rights_.

  



  

(a) _Voluntary or Involuntary Liquidation_. In the event of any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Issuer, whether voluntary or
involuntary, holders of Designated Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive for each share of Designated Preferred Stock, out of the assets of
the Issuer or proceeds thereof (whether capital or surplus) available for
distribution to stockholders of the Issuer, subject to the rights of any
creditors of the Issuer, before any distribution of such assets or proceeds is
made to or set aside for the holders of Common Stock and any other stock of
the Issuer ranking junior to Designated Preferred Stock as to such
distribution, payment in full in an amount equal to the sum of (i) the
Liquidation Amount per share and (ii) the amount of any accrued and unpaid
dividends on each such share (such amounts collectively, the " _Liquidation
Preference_ ").

  



  

(b) _Partial Payment_. If in any distribution described in Section 4(a) above
the assets of the Issuer or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay
in full the amounts payable with respect to all outstanding shares of
Designated Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable with respect
of any other stock of the Issuer ranking equally with Designated Preferred
Stock as to such distribution, holders of Designated Preferred Stock and the
holders of such other stock shall share ratably in any such distribution in
proportion to the full respective distributions to which they are entitled.

  



  

   

-24- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) _Residual Distributions_. If the Liquidation Preference has been paid in
full to all holders of Designated Preferred Stock and the corresponding
amounts payable with respect of any other stock of the Issuer ranking equally
with Designated Preferred Stock as to such distribution has been paid in
full, the holders of other stock of the Issuer shall be entitled to receive
all remaining assets of the Issuer (or proceeds thereof) according to their
respective rights and preferences.

  



  

(d) _Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets Is Not Liquidation_. For
purposes of this Section 4, the merger or consolidation of the Issuer with any
other corporation or other entity, including a merger or consolidation in
which the holders of Designated Preferred Stock receive cash, securities or
other property for their shares, or the sale, lease or exchange (for cash,
securities or other property) of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Issuer, shall not constitute a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of
the Issuer.

  



  

Section 5. _Redemption_.

  



  

(a) _Optional Redemption_.

  



  

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 5:

  



   | (1)| The Issuer, at its option, subject to the approval of the
Appropriate Federal Banking Agency, may redeem, in whole or in part, at any
time and from time to time, out of funds legally available therefor, the
shares of Designated Preferred Stock at the time outstanding; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| If, after the Signing Date, there is a change in law that
modifies the terms of Treasury's investment in the Designated Preferred Stock
or the terms of Treasury's Small Business Lending Fund program in a
materially adverse respect for the Issuer, the Issuer may, after consultation
with the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency, redeem all of the shares of
Designated Preferred Stock at the time outstanding. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

(ii) The per-share redemption price for shares of Designated Preferred Stock
shall be equal to the sum of:

  



   | (1)| the Liquidation Amount per share, 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (2)| the per-share amount of any unpaid dividends for the then current
Dividend Period at the Applicable Dividend Rate to, but excluding, the date
fixed for redemption (regardless of whether any dividends are actually
declared for that Dividend Period; and 
---|---|--- 
  



  

   

-25- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



   | (3)| the pro rata amount of CPP Lending Incentive Fees for the current
Dividend Period. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The redemption price for any shares of Designated Preferred Stock shall be
payable on the redemption date to the holder of such shares against
surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing such shares to the Issuer or its
agent. Any declared but unpaid dividends for the then current Dividend Period
payable on a redemption date that occurs subsequent to the Dividend Record
Date for a Dividend Period shall not be paid to the holder entitled to
receive the redemption price on the redemption date, but rather shall be paid
to the holder of record of the redeemed shares on such Dividend Record Date
relating to the Dividend Payment Date as provided in Section 3 above.

  



  

(b) _No Sinking Fund_. The Designated Preferred Stock will not be subject to
any mandatory redemption, sinking fund or other similar provisions. Holders
of Designated Preferred Stock will have no right to require redemption or
repurchase of any shares of Designated Preferred Stock.

  



  

(c) _Notice of Redemption_. Notice of every redemption of shares of
Designated Preferred Stock shall be given by first class mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed at
their respective last addresses appearing on the books of the Issuer. Such
mailing shall be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date
fixed for redemption. Any notice mailed as provided in this Subsection shall
be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder
receives such notice, but failure duly to give such notice by mail, or any
defect in such notice or in the mailing thereof, to any holder of shares of
Designated Preferred Stock designated for redemption shall not affect the
validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other shares of
Designated Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if shares of
Designated Preferred Stock are issued in book-entry form through The
Depository Trust Company or any other similar facility, notice of redemption
may be given to the holders of Designated Preferred Stock at such time and in
any manner permitted by such facility. Each notice of redemption given to a
holder shall state: (1) the redemption date; (2) the number of shares of
Designated Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all the
shares held by such holder are to be redeemed, the number of such shares to
be redeemed from such holder; (3) the redemption price; and (4) the place or
places where certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of
the redemption price.

  



  

(d) _Partial Redemption_. In case of any redemption of part of the shares of
Designated Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, the shares to be
redeemed shall be selected either _pro rata_ or in such other manner as the
Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof may determine to be
fair and equitable, but in any event the shares to be redeemed shall not be
less than the Minimum Amount. Subject to the provisions hereof, the Board of
Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof shall have full power and
authority to prescribe the terms and conditions upon which shares of
Designated Preferred Stock shall be redeemed from time to time, subject to
the approval of the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency. If fewer than all the
shares represented by any certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall
be issued representing the unredeemed shares without charge to the holder
thereof.

  



  

   

-26-

--- 

    



  

(e) _Effectiveness of Redemption_. If notice of redemption has been duly
given and if on or before the redemption date specified in the notice all
funds necessary for the redemption have been deposited by the Issuer, in trust
for the _pro rata_ benefit of the holders of the shares called for
redemption, with a bank or trust company doing business in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York, and having a capital and surplus of at least
$500 million and selected by the Board of Directors, so as to be and continue
to be available solely therefor, then, notwithstanding that any certificate
for any share so called for redemption has not been surrendered for
cancellation, on and after the redemption date dividends shall cease to accrue
on all shares so called for redemption, all shares so called for redemption
shall no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights with respect to such
shares shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate, except
only the right of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable on
such redemption from such bank or trust company, without interest. Any funds
unclaimed at the end of three years from the redemption date shall, to the
extent permitted by law, be released to the Issuer, after which time the
holders of the shares so called for redemption shall look only to the Issuer
for payment of the redemption price of such shares.

  



  

(f) _Status of Redeemed Shares_. Shares of Designated Preferred Stock that
are redeemed, repurchased or otherwise acquired by the Issuer shall revert to
authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock ( _provided_ that any such
cancelled shares of Designated Preferred Stock may be reissued only as shares
of any series of Preferred Stock other than Designated Preferred Stock).

  



  

Section 6. _Conversion_. Holders of Designated Preferred Stock shares shall
have no right to exchange or convert such shares into any other securities.

  



  

Section 7. _Voting Rights_.

  



  

(a) _General_. The holders of Designated Preferred Stock shall not have any
voting rights except as set forth below or as otherwise from time to time
required by law.

  



  

(b) _Board Observation Rights_. Whenever, at any time or times, dividends on
the shares of Designated Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid in
full within five (5) Business Days after each Dividend Payment Date for an
aggregate of five (5) Dividend Periods or more, whether or not consecutive,
the Issuer shall invite a representative selected by the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Designated Preferred Stock, voting as a single
class, to attend all meetings of its Board of Directors in a nonvoting
observer capacity and, in this respect, shall give such representative copies
of all notices, minutes, consents, and other materials that it provides to
its directors in connection with such meetings; _provided_ , that the holders
of the Designated Preferred Stock shall not be obligated to select such a
representative, nor shall such representative, if selected, be obligated to
attend any meeting to which he/she is invited. The rights of the holders of
the Designated Preferred Stock set forth in this Section 7(b) shall terminate
when full dividends have been timely paid on the Designated Preferred Stock
for at least four consecutive Dividend Periods, subject to revesting in the
event of each and every subsequent default of the character above mentioned.

  



  

   

-27- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) _Preferred Stock Directors_. Whenever, at any time or times, (i)
dividends on the shares of Designated Preferred Stock have not been
declared and paid in full within five (5) Business Days after each Dividend
Payment Date for an aggregate of six (6) Dividend Periods or more, whether or
not consecutive, and (ii) the aggregate liquidation preference of the then-
outstanding shares of Designated Preferred Stock is greater than or equal to
$25,000,000, the authorized number of directors of the Issuer shall
automatically be increased by two and the holders of the Designated Preferred
Stock, voting as a single class, shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to elect two directors (hereinafter the " _Preferred Directors_ "
and each a " _Preferred Director_ ") to fill such newly created directorships
at the Issuer's next annual meeting of stockholders (or, if the next annual
meeting is not yet scheduled or is scheduled to occur more than thirty days
later, the President of the Company shall promptly call a special meeting for
that purpose) and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders until full
dividends have been timely paid on the Designated Preferred Stock for at
least four consecutive Dividend Periods, at which time such right shall
terminate with respect to the Designated Preferred Stock, except as herein or
by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event of each
and every subsequent default of the character above mentioned; _provided_
that it shall be a qualification for election for any Preferred Director that
the election of such Preferred Director shall not cause the Issuer to violate
any corporate governance requirements of any securities exchange or other
trading facility on which securities of the Issuer may then be listed or
traded that listed or traded companies must have a majority of independent
directors. Upon any termination of the right of the holders of shares of
Designated Preferred Stock to vote for directors as provided above, the
Preferred Directors shall cease to be qualified as directors, the term of
office of all Preferred Directors then in office shall terminate immediately
and the authorized number of directors shall be reduced by the number of
Preferred Directors elected pursuant hereto. Any Preferred Director may be
removed at any time, with or without cause, and any vacancy created thereby
may be filled, only by the affirmative vote of the holders a majority of the
shares of Designated Preferred Stock at the time outstanding voting separately
as a class. If the office of any Preferred Director becomes vacant for any
reason other than removal from office as aforesaid, the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Designated Preferred Stock, voting as a single
class, may choose a successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in
respect of which such vacancy occurred.

  



  

(d) _Class Voting Rights as to Particular Matters_. So long as any shares of
Designated Preferred Stock are outstanding, in addition to any other vote or
consent of stockholders required by law or by the Charter, the written consent
of (x) Treasury if Treasury holds any shares of Designated Preferred Stock,
or (y) the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Designated
Preferred Stock, voting as a single class, if Treasury does not hold any
shares of Designated Preferred Stock, shall be necessary for effecting or
validating:

  



  

(i) _Authorization of Senior Stock_. Any amendment or alteration of the
Certificate of Designation for the Designated Preferred Stock or the
Charter to authorize or create or increase the authorized amount of, or any
issuance of, any shares of, or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for shares of, any class or series of capital
stock of the Issuer ranking senior to Designated Preferred Stock with respect
to either or both the payment of dividends and/or the distribution of assets
on any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Issuer;

  



  

(ii) _Amendment of Designated Preferred Stock_. Any amendment, alteration or
repeal of any provision of the Certificate of Designation for the Designated
Preferred Stock or the Charter (including, unless no vote on such merger or
consolidation is required by Section 7(d)(iii) below, any amendment,
alteration or repeal by means of a merger, consolidation or otherwise) so as
to adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of
the Designated Preferred Stock;

  



  

   

-28- 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(iii) _Share Exchanges, Reclassifications, Mergers and Consolidations_.
Subject to Section 7(d)(v) below, any consummation of a binding
share exchange or reclassification involving the Designated Preferred Stock,
or of a merger or consolidation of the Issuer with another corporation or
other entity, unless in each case (x) the shares of Designated Preferred Stock
remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with
respect to which the Issuer is not the surviving or resulting entity, are
converted into or exchanged for preference securities of the surviving or
resulting entity or its ultimate parent, and (y) such shares
remaining outstanding or such preference securities, as the case may be, have
such rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and
restrictions thereof that are the same as the rights, preferences, privileges
and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of Designated
Preferred Stock immediately prior to such consummation, taken as a whole;
provided, that in all cases, the obligations of the Issuer are assumed (by
operation of law or by express written assumption) by the resulting entity or
its ultimate parent;

  



  

(iv) _Certain Asset Sales_. Any sale of all, substantially all, or any
material portion of, the assets of the Company, if the Designated
Preferred Stock will not be redeemed in full contemporaneously with the
consummation of such sale; and

  



  

(v) _Holding Company Transactions_. Any consummation of a Holding Company
Transaction, unless as a result of the Holding Company Transaction each share
of Designated Preferred Stock shall be converted into or exchanged for one
share with an equal liquidation preference of preference securities of the
Issuer or the Acquiror (the " _Holding Company Preferred Stock_ "). Any such
Holding Company Preferred Stock shall entitle holders thereof to dividends
from the date of issuance of such Holding Company Preferred Stock on terms
that are equivalent to the terms set forth herein, and shall have such other
rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and limitations and
restrictions thereof that are the same as the rights, preferences, privileges
and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof, of Designated
Preferred Stock immediately prior to such conversion or exchange, taken as a
whole;

  



  

 _provided, however_ , that for all purposes of this Section 7(d), any
increase in the amount of the authorized Preferred Stock, including any
increase in the authorized amount of Designated Preferred Stock necessary to
satisfy preemptive or similar rights granted by the Issuer to other persons

customers of the corporation and its subsidiaries and the future value of the

(6) Any antitrust or other legal and regulatory issues that are raised by
the offer.

  



  

If the Board of Directors determines that an offer should be rejected, it may
take any lawful action to accomplish its purpose including, but not
limited to, any and all of the following: advising shareholders not to accept
the offer; litigation against the offeror; filing complaints with all
governmental and regulatory authorities; acquiring the corporation's
securities; selling or otherwise issuing authorized but unissued securities
or treasury stock or granting options with respect thereto; acquiring a
company to create an antitrust or other regulatory problem for the offeror;
and obtaining a more favorable offer from another individual or entity.

which he may become involved by reason of his being or having been a director,
officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or of such other corporation,
whether or not he is a director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation or such other corporation at the time the expenses or liabilities
are incurred.

  



  

 _Thirteenth_ : No merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the
corporation nor any action that would result in the sale or other

Section 1. LAW, CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS; CLARIFICATION.

  



  

1.1. These by-laws are subject to the certificate of incorporation of the
corporation. In these by-laws, references to law, the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws mean the law, the provisions of the certificate of
incorporation and the by-laws as from time to time in effect.

hereinafter defined). These bylaws are the by-laws of the corporation which,
immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, was named Center Bancorp,

which immediately prior to the Merger was named Center Bancorp, Inc. and
which is the surviving corporation in the Merger.

  



  

Section 2. SHAREHOLDERS

  



  

2.1. _Annual Meeting_. The annual meeting of shareholders shall be held at
such date and time as shall be designated from time to time by the board
of directors and stated in the notice of the meeting, at which time the
shareholders shall elect a board of directors and transact such other
business as may be required by law or these by-laws or as may properly come
before the meeting.

  



  

2.2. _Special Meetings_. A special meeting of the shareholders may be called
at any time by the chairman of the board, if any, the Chief
Executive Officer, the president or the board of directors. A special meeting
of the shareholders shall be called by the secretary, or in the case of the
death, absence, incapacity or refusal of the secretary, by an assistant
secretary or some other officer, upon application of a majority of the
directors. Any such application shall state the purpose or purposes of the
proposed meeting. Any such call shall state the place, date, hour, and
purposes of the meeting.

  



  

2.3. _Place of Meeting_. All meetings of the shareholders for the election of
directors or for any other purpose shall be held at such place within or
without the State of New Jersey as may be determined from time to time by the

2.4. _Notice of Meetings_. Except as otherwise provided by law, a written
notice of each meeting of shareholders stating the place, day and hour
thereof and, in the case of a special meeting, the purposes for which the
meeting is called, shall be given not less then ten nor more than sixty days
before the meeting, to each shareholder entitled to vote thereat, and to each
shareholder who, by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-
laws, is entitled to notice, by leaving such notice with him or at
his residence or usual place of business, or by depositing it in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to such shareholder at his
address as it appears in the records of the corporation. Such notice shall be
given by the secretary, or by an officer or person designated by the board of
directors, or in the case of a special meeting by the officer calling the
meeting. As to any adjourned session of any meeting of shareholders, notice
of the adjourned meeting need not be given if the time and place thereof are
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment was taken except that if
after the adjournment a new record date is set for the adjourned session,
notice of any such adjourned session of the meeting shall be given in the
manner heretofore described. No notice of any meeting of shareholders or any
adjourned session thereof need be given` to a shareholder if a written waiver
of notice, executed before or after the meeting or such adjourned session by
such shareholder, in person or by proxy, is filed with the records of the
meeting or if the shareholder attends such meeting, in person or by proxy,
without objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the
business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the
shareholders or any adjourned session thereof need be specified in any written
waiver of notice.

  



  

2.5. _Quorum of Shareholders_. At any meeting of the shareholders a quorum
shall consist of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting,
except where a larger quorum is required by law, by the certificate of
incorporation or by these by-laws. Any meeting may be adjourned from time to
time by a majority of the votes properly cast upon the question, whether or
not a quorum is present. If a quorum is present at an original meeting, a
quorum need not be present at an adjourned session of that meeting. Shares
of its own stock belonging to the corporation or to another corporation, if a
majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such
other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the corporation, shall
neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of any corporation to
vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a
fiduciary capacity.

  



  

2.6. _Action by Vote_. When a quorum is present at any meeting, a plurality
of the votes properly cast for election to any office shall elect to such
office and a majority of the votes properly cast upon any question other than
an election to an office shall decide the question, except when a larger vote
is required by law, by the certificate of incorporation or by these by-laws.
No ballot shall be required for any election unless requested by a
shareholder present or represented at the meeting and entitled to vote in
the election.

  



  

2.7. _Action without Meetings_. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate
of incorporation or by applicable law, any action required or permitted to be
taken by shareholders for or in connection with any corporate action may be
taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a
consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by all
of the holders of outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon. The writing or
writings comprising such unanimous consent shall be filed with the records of
the meetings of shareholders.

2.8. _Proxy Representation_. Every shareholder may authorize another person
or persons to act for him by proxy in all matters in which a shareholder is
entitled to participate, whether by waiving notice of any meeting, objecting
to or voting or participating at a meeting, or expressing consent or dissent
without a meeting. Every proxy must be signed by the shareholder or by his
attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be voted or acted upon after eleven months
from its date unless such proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed
proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and, if, and
only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support
an irrevocable power. A proxy may be made irrevocable regardless of whether
the interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or
an interest in the corporation generally. The authorization of a proxy may but
need not be limited to specified action, provided, however, that if a proxy
limits its authorization to a meeting or meetings of shareholders,
unless otherwise specifically provided such proxy shall entitle the holder
thereof to vote at any adjourned session but shall not be valid after the
final adjournment thereof.

  



  

2.9. _Inspectors_. The directors or the person presiding at the meeting may,
but need not, appoint one or more inspectors of election and any
substitute inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof. Each
inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his duties, shall take and
sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector at such meeting
with strict impartiality and according to the best of his ability. The
inspectors, if any, shall determine the number of shares of stock outstanding
and the voting power of each, the shares of stock represented at the meeting,
the existence of a quorum, the validity and effect of proxies, and
shall receive votes, ballots or consents, hear and determine all challenges
and questions arising in connection with the right to vote, count and
tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, determine the result, and do such
acts as are proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all
shareholders. On request of the person presiding at the meeting, the
inspectors shall make a report in writing of any challenge, question or
matter determined by them and execute a certificate of any fact found by them.

  



  

2.10. _List of Shareholders_. The secretary shall prepare and make, at least
ten days before every meeting of shareholders, a complete list of the
shareholders entitled to vote at such meeting, arranged in alphabetical order
and showing the address of each shareholder and the number of shares
registered in his name. The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who
are shareholders entitled to examine such list or to vote in person or by
proxy at such meeting.

  



  

Section 3. BOARD OF DIRECTORS

  



  

3.1. _Number; Qualifications_. The number of directors which shall constitute
the whole board shall not be less than one nor more than twenty-five in
number. Thereafter, within the foregoing limits, the Board of Directors shall
determine the number of directors and the shareholders at the annual meeting
shall elect the number of directors as determined. Within the foregoing
limits, the number of directors may be increased at any time or from time to
time by the shareholders or by the directors by vote of a majority of the
directors then in office. The number of directors may be decreased to any
number permitted by the foregoing at any time either by the shareholders or
by the directors by vote of a majority of the directors then in office, but
only to eliminate vacancies existing by reason of the death, resignation or
removal of one or more directors. Notwithstanding the forgoing, until the 2017
annual meeting of shareholders, the entire Board Directors shall be made up
of twelve (12) members, six (6) of whom (the "Former ConnectOne
Directors") shall have served as members of the Board of Directors of
ConnectOne Bancorp, Inc. ("ConnectOne") prior to the merger of ConnectOne and
the corporation (the "Merger"), and six (6) of whom (the "Former Pre-Merger
Center Directors") shall have served as members of the Board of Directors of
the corporation prior to the Merger. However, until the 2017 annual
meeting of shareholders, in the event any director of the corporation ceases
service on the Board of Directors for any reason, the individual nominated to
replace such director shall be an individual who constitutes a Legacy Nominee.
For purposes of these by-laws, (A) in the event that a Former ConnectOne
Director ceases service on the Board, the term "Legacy Director" shall mean
an individual selected by a majority of the Former ConnectOne Directors then
serving on the Board (including anyone who became a Legacy Director as a
result of the cessation of service of a Former ConnectOne Director) and then
approved by a vote of two-thirds of the entire Board, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, and (B) in the event that a Former Pre-Merger Center
Director ceases service on the Board, the term "Legacy Director" shall mean
an individual selected by a majority of the Former Pre-Merger Center
Directors then serving on the Board (including anyone who became a Legacy
Director as a result of the cessation of service of a Former Pre-Merger
Center Director) and then approved by a vote of two-thirds of the entire
Board, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a replacement director cannot be selected
by means of this process after a good faith attempt to do so, the Board, by
a vote of two-thirds of the entire Board, shall select an individual to
replace the director who has left the board.

--- 

 


--- 

    



  

Nominations or other proposals, other than those made by, or at the direction
of, a majority of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof shall be made
only if timely written notice has been given to the Secretary of the
corporation. To be timely, such notice shall be delivered to or mailed and
received at the principal executive offices of the corporation not less than
50 days nor more than 75 days prior to the meeting, irrespective of any
deferrals, postponements or adjournments thereof to a later date; provided,
however, that in the event that less than 60 days notice or prior public
disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to
stockholders, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not
later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which
such notice of the date of meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was
made, whichever first occurs.

  



  

Each such notice to the Secretary shall set forth: (i) the name and address
of record of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination; (ii)
a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of shares of the
corporation entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person
or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the
notice; (iii) the name, age, business and residence addresses, and principal
occupation or employment of each nominee if the proposal is a nomination to
the Board of Directors; (iv) a description of all arrangements or
understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person
or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or
nominations are to be made by the stockholder; (v) such other information
regarding each nominee proposed by such stockholder as would be required to be
included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, as then in effect; (vi) the consent of
each nominee to serve as a director of the corporation if so elected and
(vii) the name, address, principal occupation and ownership of
the corporation of any other party having an interest in the proposal. The
corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other
information as may reasonably be required by the corporation to determine the
eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the
corporation.

A majority of the Board of Directors may reject any proposal or nomination by
a stockholder not timely made or otherwise not in accordance with the
terms of this Section 3.1. If a majority of the Board of Directors reasonably
determines that the information provided in a stockholder\'s notice does not
satisfy the informational requirements of this Section 3.1 in any material
respect, the Secretary of the corporation shall promptly notify such
stockholder of the deficiency in writing. The stockholder shall have an
opportunity to cure the deficiency by providing additional information to the
Secretary within such period of time, not to exceed ten days from the date
such deficiency notice is given to the stockholder, as a majority of the
Board of Directors shall reasonably determine. If the deficiency is not cured
within such period, or if a majority of the Board of Directors reasonably

testator or intestate is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or
is serving or has served such other corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise in any capacity,

expenses, including attorneys\' fees, incurred therein or in any appeal
thereof.

persons and reimburse the expenses thereof, to the extent required by

Section 12.1, upon receipt of a written undertaking by or on behalf of such
person to repay such amount(s) if a judgment or other final adjudication
adverse to the director or officer establishes that his acts or omissions (i)
constitute a breach of his duty of loyalty to the corporation or its
shareholders, (ii) were not in good faith, (iii) involved a knowing
violation of law, (iv) resulted in his receiving an improper personal
benefit, or (v) were otherwise of such a character that New Jersey law would
require that such amount(s) be repaid.

  



  

12.4. _Service of Certain Entities Deemed_ _Requested_. Any director or
officer of the corporation serving (i) another corporation, of which a
majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of its directors is

retroactive and shall be available with respect to events occurring prior to
the adoption hereof, (iii) shall continue to exist after any elimination of or

reimbursement or advancement of expenses pursuant hereto is not paid in

received by the corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring
suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if
successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled also to be
paid the expenses of prosecuting such claim. Neither the failure of the
corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or
its shareholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such action that indemnification of or reimbursement or advancement of
expenses to the claimant is proper in the circumstances, nor an actual
determination by the corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel, or its shareholders) that the claimant is not
entitled to indemnification or to the reimbursement or advancement of
expenses, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
claimant is not so entitled.
