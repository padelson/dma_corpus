the calendar month immediately following the day on which the conditions set
forth in _Article 6_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions which by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing by any
Party, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) at the
offices of Schiff Hardin LLP, 233 South Wacker Drive, Suite 7100, Chicago,
Illinois 60606; _provided_ , that if such day is not a Business Day, then the
Closing shall take place on the first Business Day thereafter;  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the last of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ are
satisfied or waived during the last five days of a calendar month, the Closing
shall take place on the first day of the second calendar month immediately
following thereafter; _provided_ , _further_ , that if such day is not a
Business Day, then the Closing shall take place on the first Business Day
thereafter, unless, in each case, another time, date or place is agreed to
in writing by Buyer and the Stockholder Representative. In lieu of an in-
person Closing, the Closing may instead be accomplished by facsimile or email
(in PDF format) transmission to the respective offices of legal counsel for
the Parties of the requisite documents, duly executed where required,
delivered upon actual confirmed receipt, with originals (where needed) to be
delivered promptly following the Closing. The date on which the Closing
actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ". Immediately
following the Closing, Buyer and the Company shall cause a certificate of
merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware as provided in the Act. The Merger shall
become effective when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware unless a different time is
specified therein (the " _Effective Time_ "). All proceedings to be taken and
all documents to be executed and delivered by all Parties at the Closing will
be deemed to have been taken and executed simultaneously and no proceedings
will be deemed to have been taken nor documents executed or delivered until
all have been taken, executed and delivered.

Section 2.5 _Letters of Transmittal; Payment of Shares_.

(a) No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer
shall or shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Share Certificate, (i) a letter of transmittal (and related tax forms) in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Share Certificates in
exchange for the consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
this Agreement. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Share Certificate (or
affidavit of loss and indemnity in lieu thereof), together with a properly
executed and completed Letter of Transmittal, and subject to and effective
upon the Closing, the holder of such Share Certificate shall in exchange
therefor be entitled to receive, as described in more detail herein,
an amount in cash equal to the product of the number of shares of Common
Stock represented by such Share Certificate multiplied by the Per Share
Consideration and such Share Certificate shall be cancelled. Delivery of a
Share Certificate (or affidavit of loss and indemnity in lieu thereof)
accompanied by a properly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal to the
Paying Agent at least two Business Days prior to the Closing shall entitle
such delivering Stockholder to payment, in accordance with the instructions
provided in the Letter of Transmittal, within three Business Days after the
Closing. Delivery of a Share Certificate (or affidavit of loss and indemnity
in lieu thereof) accompanied by a properly executed and completed Letter of
Transmittal to the Paying Agent less than two Business Days prior to the
Closing or subsequent to the Closing shall entitle such delivering Stockholder
to payment in accordance with the instructions provided in the Letter of
Transmittal within five Business Days of receipt by the Paying Agent of such
Share Certificate (or affidavit of loss and indemnity in lieu thereof) and
Letter of Transmittal.

 



16 (b) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a
Share Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that the Share Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise in a proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of the Share Certificate
surrendered.

(c) Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section_ __
_ 2.5_, each Share Certificate representing any Share (other than Share
Certificates representing Shares owned by Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company or
any Subsidiary of Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company, and other than Dissenting
Shares, if any) shall represent for all purposes only the right to receive, as
provided in this Agreement, the allocable portion of the consideration
expressly provided to be received in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement without interest, and shall have no other rights.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Party shall
be liable to a holder of Shares for any amount paid for any amount paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws.

 

(e) In the event this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing, previously
delivered Letters of Transmittal shall be null and void and any Share
Certificates delivered therewith shall be returned promptly by the Paying
Agent to the respective holders of record of such Share Certificates.

 

(f) Payments of fair value in respect of Dissenting Shares, if any, pursuant
to the Act shall be made, first, from that portion of the Closing Merger
Consideration allocable to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.5(a)_ hereof and, second, by Buyer or the Surviving Company directly. After
any such payments have been made, any such Dissenting Shares shall
be cancelled.

(g) No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount owed or payable to any
holder of a Share Certificate pursuant to this Agreement.

(h) If any Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of a customary affidavit and an indemnity of that fact by the
Person claiming such Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed in
accordance with the instructions contained in the Letter of Transmittal, the
Surviving Company will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Share Certificate the consideration to which such holder would be entitled to
receive hereunder (without interest) if they had their Share Certificate.

Section 2.7 _Stockholder Consent_.

 

(a) The Company shall obtain, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no
event later than 11:59 p.m. central time on the first Business Day after the

all members of the Companys board of directors who own shares of Common Stock
as of such time, in each case to adopt and approve this Agreement as required
under the Company Charter and the Act in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
F_ (the " _Stockholder Consent_ ").

(b) Promptly following receipt of the Stockholder Consent, but in no event
later than two Business Days after receipt of the Stockholder Consent, the
Company shall deliver to any holder of Common Stock who has not approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (a) a notice of the

19 Section 2.8 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) The Company shall deliver to Buyer, at least three Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, a statement of the Company (the " _Estimated Closing
Statement_ "), certified by an officer of the Company, setting forth in
reasonable detail the Companys good faith estimates of (i) the Closing Net
Working Capital Amount (the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Amount_ "),
including a calculation of Current Assets and Current Liabilities (in each
case, with each of the line items used in such calculation and the entries in
the Companys general ledger from which such line items are derived), (ii)
the Closing Date Cash (the " _Estimated Closing Date Cash_ "), (iii) the
Closing Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "), (iv)
Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "), (v) the
number of Shares outstanding as of the Effective Time and (vi) based on such
estimates described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (v), a calculation of
the Closing Merger Consideration and the Per Share Consideration, in each
case, with reasonable supporting detail therefor sufficient to allow Buyer to
independently calculate such amounts (including an itemized list of the
components thereof), and such estimates shall be prepared in accordance
with the Agreed Accounting Principles and consistent with _Section_ __ _
2.8(h)_. The Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, the Estimated Closing Date
Cash, the Estimated Closing Indebtedness and the Estimated Transaction
Expenses shall, subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)_, be used to calculate the
Closing Merger Consideration and the Per Share Consideration, and shall be
subject to adjustment as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_.

 

(b) Within two Business Days of the Companys delivery of the Estimated
Closing Statement, if Buyer acting in good faith has any objections with
respect to one or more line items on the Estimated Closing Statement so
delivered, then Buyer may deliver to the Company a statement describing its
objections in reasonable detail (the " _Pre-Closing Dispute Notice_"). Buyer
and the Company shall use their respective good faith efforts to resolve any
dispute with respect to any of the line items on the Estimated
Closing Statement prior to the anticipated Closing Date. If Buyer and the
Company are unable to resolve all disputes with respect to any of the line
items on the Estimated Closing Statement prior to the anticipated Closing
Date, then the Estimated Closing Statement as originally delivered pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_ and, if applicable, as revised following mutual
agreement between Buyer and the Company on any disputes, shall constitute the
Estimated Closing Statement for all purposes under this Agreement. Buyers
election to not deliver a Pre-Closing Dispute Notice, or to not dispute any
amount included in, or component of any such amount included in, the Estimated
Closing Statement in any Pre-Closing Dispute Notice or any agreed upon
adjustments to the Estimated Closing Statement, shall not limit, or have any
effect on, Buyers rights pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)_ to conduct a
review of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Date Cash, the
Closing Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and the number of Shares
outstanding as of the Effective Time, and to deliver the Closing Date
Schedule based on such review.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than 75 days following the
Closing Date, Buyer shall, at its expense, (i) cause to be prepared a
statement (the " _Closing Date Schedule_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail
Buyers good faith calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount,
Closing Date Cash, the Closing Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses and the
number of Shares outstanding as of the Effective Time, in each case without
giving effect to the transactions occurring at the Closing or any purchase
accounting or similar adjustments resulting from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, based on such amounts,
Buyers calculation of the Purchase Price, the Closing Merger Consideration
and the Per Share Consideration and (ii) deliver to the Stockholder
Representative the Closing Date Schedule, together with a certificate of Buyer
confirming that the Closing Date Schedule was prepared in good faith and in
accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.8(b)_. The Closing Date Schedule,
including the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Date Cash, Closing
Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses, shall be prepared in accordance with
the Agreed Accounting Principles and consistent with _Section_ __ _ 2.8(h)_.

 



20 (d) _Review; Disputes_.

 

(i) From and after the Closing until the Purchase Price is finally determined
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_, Buyer shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the Stockholder Representative and any
accountants or advisors retained by the Stockholder Representative such
information and detail as they shall reasonably request for the purpose
of enabling the Stockholder Representative and its accountants and advisors
to calculate, and to review Buyers calculation of, the Closing Net Working
Capital Amount, Closing Date Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Transaction Expenses,
the Purchase Price, the Closing Merger Consideration and the Per Share
Consideration; _provided_ , that, in no event shall Buyer be required to
provide any documents or other information covered by attorney-client
privilege, the attorney work product doctrine or other similar protection (it
being agreed that Buyer shall be required to notify the Stockholder
Representative that it is withholding documents or information because of such
privilege or protection and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
documents and information (or the contents thereof) to the greatest extent
possible without waiving such privilege or protection).

 

(ii) If the Stockholder Representative disputes the calculation of any of the
Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Date Cash, Closing Indebtedness
or Transaction Expenses set forth in the Closing Date Schedule, then the
Stockholder Representative shall deliver a written notice (a " _Dispute
Notice_ ") to Buyer at any time during the thirty day period commencing
upon receipt by the Stockholder Representative of the Closing Date Schedule
and the related certificate of Buyer (the " _Review Period_ "). The Dispute
Notice shall set forth the basis for the dispute of any such calculation in
reasonable detail and the Stockholder Representatives proposed resolution of
each such dispute.

(iii) If the Stockholder Representative does not deliver a Dispute Notice to
Buyer prior to the expiration of the Review Period, Buyers calculation of the
Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Date Cash, Closing Indebtedness,
Transaction Expenses, the Purchase Price, the Closing Merger Consideration
and the Per Share Consideration set forth in the Closing Date Schedule shall
be deemed final, binding and non-appealable for all purposes under this
Agreement.

 

(iv) If the Stockholder Representative delivers a Dispute Notice to Buyer
prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the
Stockholder Representative and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to reach agreement on the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing
Date Cash, Closing Indebtedness and/or Transaction Expenses that are in
dispute and such negotiations shall be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal
Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule. If the Stockholder
Representative and Buyer are unable to reach agreement on the Closing Net
Working Capital Amount, Closing Date Cash, Closing Indebtedness and/or
Transaction Expenses that are in dispute within twenty days after the end of
the Review Period, then the Stockholder Representative or Buyer shall have the
right to refer such dispute to the Designated Accounting Firm after such
twentieth day. In connection with the resolution of any such dispute by the
Designated Accounting Firm: (A) each of the Stockholder Representative and
Buyer shall have a reasonable opportunity to meet with the Designated
Accounting Firm to provide its views as to any disputed issues with respect
to the calculation of any of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing
Date Cash, Closing Indebtedness and/or Transaction Expenses; (B) each of the
Stockholder Representative and Buyer shall promptly provide, or cause to be
provided or made available, to the Designated Accounting Firm all information
as is reasonably necessary to permit the Designated Accounting Firm, acting as
an expert, not as an arbitrator, to resolve such disputes; (C) the Designated
Accounting Firm shall determine the Closing Net Working Capital Amount,
Closing Date Cash, Closing Indebtedness and/or Transaction Expenses in
accordance with the terms and definitions of this Agreement (including the
Agreed Accounting Principles) within thirty days after such referral, and
upon reaching such determination shall deliver a copy of its calculations (the
" _Expert Calculations_ ") to the Stockholder Representative and Buyer; (D)
subject to manifest error, the determination made by the Designated
Accounting Firm of the Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Date Cash,
Closing Indebtedness and/or Transaction Expenses that are in dispute shall be
conclusive, binding upon the Parties hereto, nonappealable, and not be
subject to further review, and shall be considered a final arbitration award
that is enforceable pursuant to the terms of the Federal Arbitration Act; and
(E) such calculation shall, with respect to any disputed item, be no greater
than the higher amount calculated by Buyer or the Stockholder Representative,
as the case may be, and no lower than the lower amount calculated by Buyer or
the Stockholder Representative. In calculating the Closing Net Working
Capital Amount, Closing Date Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction
Expenses, the Designated Accounting Firm shall be limited to addressing only
those particular disputed items referred to in the Dispute Notice. The Expert
Calculations shall reflect in detail the differences, if any, between the
Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Date Cash, Closing Indebtedness
and/or Transaction Expenses reflected therein and the Closing Net Working
Capital Amount, Closing Date Cash, Closing Indebtedness and/or Transaction
Expenses set forth in the Closing Date Schedule. The fees and expenses of the
Designated Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand,
and Stockholders, severally in proportion to their respective Percentage
Shares and paid from the Representative Holdback Amount, on the other hand,
based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each party bears to the amount actually contested by such party.
For example, if the Stockholder Representative claims that the appropriate
adjustments are $1,000 greater than the amount determined by Buyer, and if the
Designated Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding to
Stockholders $300 of the $1,000 contested, then the fees, costs and expenses
of the Designated Accounting Firm will be allocated 30% ( _i.e._ 300 ÷ 1,000)
to Buyer and 70% ( _i.e._ 700 ÷ 1,000) to Stockholders.

 



 



21 (e) If (i) the Closing Merger Consideration using the Closing Net Working
Capital Amount, Closing Date Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction
Expenses as finally determined in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ is
greater than (ii) the Closing Merger Consideration calculated as set forth
in  _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_ using the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount,
Estimated Closing Date Cash, Estimated Closing Indebtedness and Estimated
Transaction Expenses as estimated in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_
(the " _Purchase Price Underpayment_ "), then (A) Buyer and the Stockholder
Representative shall promptly jointly instruct the Escrow Agent (but in any
event within five Business Days of the final determination thereof) to
release the full Escrow Amount to the Paying Agent, after paying all amounts
from the Escrow Amount that constitute Profit Sharing Plan Adjustment Payments
to the account or accounts designated by the Company, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (for further payment to the Stockholders in
accordance with their Percentage Shares (which may be revised based on the
process set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_), thereof in accordance with
their instructions for payment in their respective completed Letters of
Transmittal); provided, however, that if all of the Stockholders have not
delivered a properly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal, prior to
the date of the aforementioned joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent,
then such joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent shall provide for the
release to Buyer (in lieu of or as directed by the Stockholder Representative)
of the allocable portion of the amount due and owing to such Stockholders
pursuant to the foregoing clause (A) who have not delivered a properly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal by such date, which amounts shall
be retained by Buyer and paid to each such Stockholder, in accordance with
their respective Percentage Shares (which may be revised based on the process
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_) and their instructions for payment in
their respective completed Letters of Transmittal, promptly following the
delivery by such Stockholder of a properly completed and executed Letter of
Transmittal, and (B) Buyer shall, or Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to, no
later than five Business Days after such determination cause to be paid to
each such Stockholder (subject to such Stockholders delivery of a properly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal) an amount equal to such
Stockholders Percentage Share of the Purchase Price Underpayment, in
accordance with their instructions for payment in their respective completed
Letters of Transmittal; provided, that Buyer shall retain and not distribute
pursuant to clause (B) of this sentence all payments in respect of
the Purchase Price Underpayment with respect to each such Stockholder who has
not delivered a properly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal as of
the date of the final determination referenced in the first sentence of this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.8(e)_; provided, further, that Buyer will pay, or will cause
the Paying Agent to pay, to each such Stockholder, promptly following the
delivery to the Surviving Company of a properly completed and executed
Letter of Transmittal an amount equal to such Stockholders Percentage Share
of such Purchase Price Underpayment in accordance with their instructions for
payment in their respective completed Letters of Transmittal.

 



22 (f) If (i) the Closing Merger Consideration calculated using the Closing Net
Working Capital Amount, Closing Date Cash, Closing Indebtedness and
Transaction Expenses as finally determined in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 2.8_ is less than (ii) the Closing Merger Consideration calculated using
the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, Estimated Closing Date Cash,
Estimated Closing Indebtedness and Estimated Transaction Expenses as estimated
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_ (the " _Purchase Price Overpayment_
"), then Buyer and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly jointly
instruct the Escrow Agent (but in any event within five Business Days of the
final determination thereof) to pay to Buyer solely from the Escrow Account,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated by Buyer, such Purchase Price Overpayment and to release the
balance (if any) of the Escrow Amount to the Paying Agent (for further payment
to the applicable Stockholders in accordance with their Percentage Share
(which may be revised based on the process set forth in this _Section_ __ _
2.8_) thereof in accordance with their instructions for payment in their
respective completed Letters of Transmittal).

 

(g) Any payments made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ shall constitute an
adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be treated as
such by the recipients thereof on their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by
any Law.

(h) _Accounting Procedures_.

(i) For all purposes hereunder, the Estimated Closing Statement, Estimated Net
Working Capital Amount, Estimated Closing Date Cash, Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, Estimated Transaction Expenses, Closing Net Working Capital
Amount, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Schedule, Closing Indebtedness and
Transaction Expenses, and all determinations and calculations by any Person
(including the Designated Accounting Firm) of Cash and Cash Equivalents,
Current Assets, Current Liabilities or Net Working Capital shall in all
circumstances be prepared and calculated strictly in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the Agreed Accounting Principles; _provided_ that such
calculations and determinations: (A) shall not include any purchase accounting
or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (B) shall be based on facts and circumstances
as they exist prior to the Closing and shall exclude the effect of any act,
decision or event occurring on or after the Closing, (C) shall follow the
defined terms contained in this Agreement whether or not such terms are
consistent with GAAP and (D) shall calculate any reserves, accruals or other
non-cash expense items on a pro rata basis (as opposed to being calculated as
of the close of business on the day before the Closing Date), to account for
a Closing that occurs on any date other than the last day of a calendar month.
For illustrative purposes only, _Exhibit C_ hereto sets forth a statement
(the " _Reference Statement_ ") prepared in good faith by the Company, in
cooperation with Buyer, setting forth and illustrating as of April 30, 2018
the calculation of (x) the various line items used (or to be used) in (1)
Current Assets, (2) Current Liabilities and (3) Net Working Capital, (y) Cash
and Cash Equivalents and (z) Indebtedness, in each case prepared and
calculated on a consolidated basis for the Group Companies in accordance with
this Agreement and the Agreed Accounting Principles.

 



23 (ii) The Parties agree that:

 

(A) Following the Closing Date through the date on which payment, if any, is
made pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.8(e)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.8(f)_, or if
the Stockholder Representative and Buyer agree that no such payment is
required, on the date of such determination, Buyer shall not, and shall cause
each Group Company not to, take any actions with respect to the accounting
records or books of any Group Company on which the Estimated Closing
Statement, Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, Estimated Closing Date Cash,
Estimated Closing Indebtedness, Estimated Transaction Expenses, Closing Date
Schedule, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses (including the
determinations and calculations therein) are to be based that are not
consistent with such Group Companys past practices in all material respects
or that would make it impracticable to calculate Estimated Closing Statement,
Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, Estimated Closing Date Cash, Estimated
Closing Indebtedness, Estimated Transaction Expenses, Closing Date
Schedule, Closing Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses in the manner
contemplated by this Agreement.

(B) In no event shall any actions taken by Buyer or any Group Company
following the Closing with respect to the accounting records, books, policies
or procedures of any Group Company on which the Estimated Closing Statement,
Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, Estimated Closing Date Cash, Estimated
Closing Indebtedness, Estimated Transaction Expenses, Closing Net Working
Capital Amount, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date Schedule, Closing Indebtedness
or Transaction Expenses are to be based that are not consistent with the
Agreed Accounting Principles (including but not limited to changes in any
reserve, allowance or other account, any changes in methodology for inventory
valuation or accounting or any reclassification of any asset) have any effect
on, or be considered in, the preparation of the Estimated Closing Statement,
Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, Estimated Closing Date Cash, Estimated
Closing Indebtedness or Estimated Transaction Expenses (including the
determinations and calculations contained therein) or the calculation of the
Closing Date Schedule, Closing Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses.

(C) The Estimated Closing Statement, Estimated Net Working Capital Amount,
Estimated Closing Date Cash, Estimated Closing Indebtedness, Estimated
Transaction Expenses, Closing Net Working Capital Amount, Closing Date Cash,
Closing Date Schedule, Closing Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses and the
respective determinations and calculations contained therein shall be prepared
and calculated without regard to any changes in GAAP made or taking effect
after the date of the Reference Statement.

 

(D) Without exception, the Target Net Working Capital Amount shall not be
subject to change (including by the Designated Accounting Firm), regardless
of whether the items or amounts included therein were recorded in accordance
with GAAP.

(E) The determinations of the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount and the
Closing Net Working Capital Amount and the resulting payment of any adjustment
relating thereto contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.8(e)_ and  _Section_ __ _
2.8(f)_ are intended solely to reflect changes between the Closing Net Working
Capital Amount and the Target Net Working Capital Amount and any such change
can be measured only if the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount and the
Closing Net Working Capital Amount and the calculations and determinations
thereof (including of Current Assets, Current Liabilities and Net Working
Capital) are prepared using the same line items, accounting principles,
practices, procedures, policies and methods (with consistent classifications,
judgments, elections inclusions, exclusions and valuation and estimation
methodologies) as were used and applied in connection with the preparation of
the Reference Statement.

 



24 (iii) _Negative Amounts_. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this
Agreement, a smaller negative integer ( _i.e._ , closer to zero) is always
"greater than" a larger negative integer ( _i.e._ , further from zero). For
example, [-2] is greater than [-10].

(i) The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that the Escrow Account shall be
Buyers sole recourse with respect to, and the exclusive source of funds for,
any payments required to be made (i) pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_,
including in the event that the Purchase Price Overpayment exceeds the Escrow
Amount or (ii) otherwise by the Stockholder Representative or any stockholder
of the Company to Buyer or any other Buyer Indemnitee (other than in the case
of Actual Fraud).

 

Section 2.9 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, holders of Share Certificates who have properly exercised,
perfected and not subsequently withdrawn or lost their appraisal rights with
respect to their Shares in the Merger in accordance with Section 262 of the
Act (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not have any of such Shares converted
into the right to receive, or become exchangeable for, the consideration they
would otherwise receive in respect thereof hereunder. The holders of such
Dissenting Shares shall instead have their Dissenting Shares converted at the
Effective Time into the right to receive payment of the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the Act
unless and until such holders fail to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost their dissenters rights and right to payment under Section
262 of the Act. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect
or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, each such holders
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if it had been converted into
the right to receive and become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the
applicable consideration to which it otherwise would be entitled to receive in
respect thereof (without interest) hereunder in accordance with the terms and
conditions hereof. The Company shall deliver prompt written notice to Buyer of
any demands for appraisal of any Shares or any attempted withdrawal of any
such demand for appraisal and any other instrument served pursuant to the Act
and received by the Company relating to the rights to be paid the fair value
or demand for appraisal of any Shares, and Buyer shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demands. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall not voluntarily make, or
agree to make, any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal with
respect to any Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands
or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, without the prior written
consent of Buyer.

Section 2.10 _Withholding_. The Company and any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer,
the Escrow Agent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amounts that
are required under the Code or any applicable Law to be deducted and
withheld; _provided_ , _however_ , that the applicable withholding agent shall
give the applicable payee notice of the intended deduction or withholding a
commercially reasonable period of time before such deduction or withholding
is required. To the extent that any such amounts are so deducted or withheld,
such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. The applicable withholding agent will pay timely or cause to be paid
any amounts withheld pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.10_ for applicable
Taxes to the appropriate Governmental Authority.

 

Section 2.11 _Restrictions on Transfer_ _of Post-Closing Payments_. The right
of each Stockholder to receive any amounts pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement following the Closing, including any portion of the Representative
Holdback Amount pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.21(g)_, any portion of any
Purchase Price Underpayment pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.8(e)_ or any other
distribution from the Escrow Account, may not be Transferred by any
Stockholder, except pursuant to a Permitted Transfer.

Section 3.10 _Employee Benefit Plans; Employment Agreements_.

 

(a) _Schedule 3.10(a)_ lists all Employee Benefit Plans. With respect to each
Employee Benefit Plan, the Company has provided or made available to Buyer or
its counsel a true and complete copy, to the extent applicable, of: (i) each
Employee Benefit Plan which has been reduced to writing, or a summary thereof
if not reduced to writing, and all amendments thereto, including, without
limitation, all plan documents, trust agreements, and insurance contracts and
other funding vehicles; (ii) the most recent annual report and accompanying
schedules; (iii) the current summary plan description and any
material modifications thereto; (iv) the most recent annual financial and
actuarial reports; (v) the most recent determination letter received by the
Group Companies from the IRS regarding the tax-qualified status of such
Employee Benefit Plan, and (vi) the most recent written results of all
required compliance testing.

(b) Other than as required under Section 601 et seq _._ of ERISA and Section
4980B of the Code and except as set forth in _Schedule 3.10(b)_ (each Employee
Benefit Plan set forth in _Schedule 3.10(b)_ being a " _Retiree Medical Plan_
"), no Employee Benefit Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" within
the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA provides benefits or coverage following
retirement or other termination of employment to employees of any Group
Company and dependents of such employees. The Group Companies have reserved
the right to amend, terminate or modify at any time all Retiree Medical Plans,
and there have been no communications to employees or former employees which
could reasonably be interpreted to promise or guarantee such employees or
former employees retiree health or life insurance or other retiree death
benefits on a permanent basis.

 

(c) No Employee Benefit Plan is (i) a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA, or (ii) a plan that has two or more contributing
sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning
of Section 4063 of ERISA, and none of the Group Companies, or any ERISA
Affiliate has withdrawn at any time within the preceding six years from any
multiemployer plan, or incurred any withdrawal liability which remains
unsatisfied, and no events have occurred and no circumstances exist that could
reasonably be expected to result in any such liability to any Group Company.
There has been no "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in
Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code and not otherwise exempt
under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975(d) of the Code with respect to
any Employee Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, result in material liability to the Group Companies. All
Employee Benefit Plans have been established, administered, funded and
maintained in all material respects in accordance with their terms and are in
compliance in all material respects with the requirements prescribed by
applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Each Employee Benefit Plan
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust intended
to qualify under Section 501(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter or is subject to an advisory opinion from the Internal
Revenue Service, or is within the applicable remedial amendment period under
Section 401(b) of the Code for purposes of obtaining an updated favorable
determination letter, and nothing has occurred with respect to the operation
of any such plan which could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of
such qualification or exemption or the imposition of any material liability,
penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code. No stock or other securities issued by
any Group Company forms or has formed any part of the assets of any Employee
Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code.
All contributions required to be made in the last five years under the terms
of any Employee Benefit Plan have been made timely or have been reflected on
the Audited Financial Statements.

provided or made available to Buyer copies of the most recent
actuarial valuation report prepared for each Pension Plan, (ii) the assets
and liabilities in respect of the accrued benefits as set forth in the most
recent actuarial valuation report prepared by the Pension Plans actuary
fairly present the funded status of such Pension Plan in all material
respects, (iii) since the date of such valuation report there has been no
material change in the funded status of any such Pension Plan, (iv) no
reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA has occurred,
(v) all premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") have
been timely paid in full, (vi) no liability (other than for premiums to the
PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by any
Group Company, and (vii) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate
any such Pension Plan and, to the knowledge of the Company, no condition
exists that presents a risk that such proceedings will be instituted or which
would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of,
or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such Pension Plan.

 

(e) No event has occurred and no condition exists that would subject any Group
Company by reason of its affiliation with any ERISA Affiliate to any (i) Tax,
penalty, fine, (ii) lien, or (iii) other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code
or other applicable Laws, in each case, in respect of any employee benefit
plan maintained, sponsored, contributed to, or required to be contributed to
by any ERISA Affiliate (other than a Group Company).

(f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in combination with
any other event) will: (i) result in any payment by any Group Company becoming
due to any current employee or former employee or individual
service providers of such Group Company or in respect of any Employee Benefit
Plan, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any of the Employee
Benefit Plans, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any benefits provided under any of the Employee Benefit Plans, or
(iv) result in a non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or section 4975 of the Code. No person is entitled to
receive any additional payment (including any tax gross-up or other payment)
from any Group Company as a result of the imposition of the excise taxes
required by Section 4999 of the Code or any taxes required by Section 409A of
the Code.

(g) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
combination with another event) result in the payment of any amount that
would, individually or in combination with any other such payment, be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

(h) Other than routine claims for benefits, there are no suits, actions,
audits, voluntary compliance requests or other proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against or otherwise involving any
Employee Benefit Plan (or the fiduciaries of any such Employee Benefit Plan in
their capacity as such) that could subject any Group Company to any judgment,
fine, penalty, Tax or liability under the Code or ERISA. No Employee Benefit
Plan is presently under audit or examination (nor has written notice been
received of a potential audit or examination) by any Governmental Authority.

 



35 (i) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) is in documentary
compliance with, and has been administered in compliance with, Section 409A of
the Code.

 

(j) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is subject to the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the " _Affordable_ _Care Act_ ") has
been established, maintained and administered in compliance in all material
respects with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. No Group Company
has attempted to maintain the grandfathered health plan status under the
Affordable Care Act of any Employee Benefit Plan.

(k) All Employee Benefit Plans subject to the laws of any jurisdiction
outside of the United States (i) have been maintained in accordance with all
applicable requirements, (ii) if they are intended to qualify for special tax
treatment, meet all requirements for such treatment, and (iii) if they are
intended to be funded and/or book-reserved, are fully funded and/or book
reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.

Environmental Claims have been finally and fully resolved. There are no past
or present actions, activities, circumstances, conditions, events or
incidents, including, without limitation, the Release, emission, discharge,
presence or disposal of any Hazardous Substances that could form the basis of
any Environmental Claim against any of the Group Companies, or against any

otherwise result in any costs or liabilities under Environmental Law.

maintain and protect each item of Registered IP, including the timely payment
of all registration, maintenance and renewal fees in respect thereof and the

of any Owned Intellectual Property, challenging the validity or enforceability
of any Owned Intellectual Property, or alleging that any Group Company is
diluting, infringing, misappropriating or violating any Intellectual
Property Rights of a third party (including any unsolicited offers to license
Intellectual Property rights or any "cease and desist" letters). Since January
1, 2014, neither the conduct of the business of the Group Companies as

with, dilute, infringe, misappropriate, or violate, nor will the use of the
Owned Intellectual Property conflict with, dilute, infringe, misappropriate,

Groups Companies rights in or to any Group Company IP Rights.

each case, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens, except for

directors and officers liability, fiduciary and employment practices
insurance policies as of the date hereof or at the Closing, for a period of
six years following the Closing Date with respect to matters occurring prior

brokerage fees and commissions) shall be a Transaction Expense.

(c) The current and former directors, managers, officers, employees and

__ _ 7.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other Party
or Parties in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.4_,
and this Agreement shall terminate, and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be abandoned, without further action by Buyer, the Stockholder
Representative or the Company.

 



59 Section 7.3 _Effect of Termination_. Except as otherwise set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_, in the event of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and have no further force or effect, without any liability on the part of any
Party hereto or its Affiliates, officers, directors or stockholders, other
than liability of the Company or Buyer, as the case may be, for any willful
breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such termination; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, a failure of Buyer to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby in breach of this Agreement shall be deemed to be willful
(whether or not Buyer had sufficient funds available to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby). In determining losses or damages
recoverable upon termination by a Party hereto for another Partys breach, the
Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that such losses and damages shall not be
limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket costs, and shall include
the benefit of the bargain lost by such Party (taking into consideration
relevant matters, including other opportunities and the time value of money),
which shall be deemed to be damages payable to such Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the provisions of _Article 1_ , _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_, _Section_
__ _ 5.5_, this _Article 7_ ,  _Article 9_ and the Confidentiality Agreement
shall survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1_ and remain valid and binding obligations of the Parties.

 

ARTICLE 8

NON-SURVIVAL

Section 8.1 _Non-Survival_. None of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement (including the Schedules
and exhibits attached hereto and the certificates delivered pursuant hereto)
will survive the Closing, and none of Buyer, the Company, the Stockholders,
the Stockholder Representative nor any of their respective Affiliates, nor any
of their respective successors and permitted assigns, heirs, officers,
employees, directors, managers, members, partners, stockholders or
representatives, will have any liability whatsoever with respect to any such
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements other than in the case of
Actual Fraud, except that any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement that by its terms is required to be performed in whole or in part
after the Closing will survive the Closing to the extent so required to be
performed after the Closing for the period contemplated by its terms.

 

ARTICLE 9

MISCELLANEOUS 

Section 9.1 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented only by a written agreement duly executed and delivered by
Buyer, the Company and the Stockholder Representative, and any purported
amendment by any Party or Parties effected in a manner which does not comply
with this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ shall be void and of no force or effect.

Section 9.2 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, the Company
may agree to (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of Buyer contained herein, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of Buyer contained herein
or in any document, certificate or writing delivered by Buyer pursuant hereto

any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the Company
contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered by any
Stockholder pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance by the Company and the
Stockholder Representative with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of any Party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of
such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights hereunder
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 



60 Section 9.3 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (together with the
exhibits hereto and the Disclosure Schedule) and the Ancillary Documents and
the Confidentiality Agreement together constitute the entire agreement among
the Parties with respect to the subject matter of such documents and supersede
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the Parties with respect to the subject matter of such documents. In the event
of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the
provisions of any Ancillary Document or the Confidentiality Agreement, the
provisions of this Agreement shall prevail. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any Party
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise), other than for collateral
purposes, without the prior written consent of Buyer and the Stockholder
Representative; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may, without the consent
of any Person, assign its rights, interests and obligations under
this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any Affiliate of Buyer; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that no such assignment shall relieve Buyer from its obligations
hereunder. Any attempted assignment of this Agreement not in accordance with
the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ shall be void and of no force or
effect.

Section 9.4 _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other
communications (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any notice or document

2_ ) under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have
been duly given (i) on the date of service if served personally on the Party

construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts to be made and performed entirely therein, without giving effect to
the principles of conflicts of law thereof or of any other jurisdiction.

Amount and (ii) the Assumed LTIP Payment Amount.

 



62 Section 9.7 _Construction; Section Headings; Draftsmanship; Interpretation_.
The term "this Agreement" means this Agreement and Plan of Merger together
with the Disclosure Schedule and exhibits hereto, as the same may from time to
time be amended, modified, supplemented or restated in accordance with the
terms hereof and thereof. The headings contained in this Agreement are
inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. No Party, nor its respective counsel, shall
be deemed to be the drafter of this Agreement for purposes of construing the
provisions hereof, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be construed
according to their fair meaning and not strictly for or against any Party.
Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary herein by the context or use
thereof: (a) the words, "herein," "hereto," "hereof" and words of similar
import refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the Disclosure Schedule
and exhibits hereto, and not to any particular section, subsection,
paragraph, subparagraph or clause contained in this Agreement; (b) masculine
gender shall also include the feminine and neutral genders, and vice versa;
(c) words importing the singular shall also include the plural, and vice
versa; (d) the words "include," "includes" or "including" shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation"; (e) a term has the meaning
assigned to it; (f) "or" is not exclusive; (g) all references in this
Agreement to designated "Articles," "Sections," "paragraphs," "clauses" and
other subdivisions are to the designated Articles, Sections, paragraphs,
clauses and other subdivisions of this Agreement unless otherwise specified;
and (h) any definition of or reference to any agreement, instrument, document,
statute or regulation herein shall be construed as referring to such
agreement, instrument, document, statute or regulation as from time to time
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified (subject to any restrictions on
such amendments, supplements or modifications set forth herein).

 

Section 9.8 _Exhibits and Schedules_. The Disclosure Schedule and all exhibits
and documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement are hereby
incorporated into this Agreement and made a part hereof as if set out in full
in this Agreement. Any item disclosed in any part, subpart, section or
subsection of the Disclosure Schedule referenced by a particular section
or subsection in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with
respect to every other section and subsection in this Agreement if the
relevance of such disclosure to such other section or subsection is readily
apparent on its face, notwithstanding the omission of an appropriate cross-
reference. Capitalized terms used in the Disclosure Schedule but not otherwise
defined therein shall have the respective meanings given to them in this
Agreement. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement is not intended to imply that such
amounts, or higher or lower amounts or other items, are or are not material,
and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts in any dispute
or controversy as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described
herein or included in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. Any item of information, matter or document disclosed or referenced
in, or attached to, the Disclosure Schedule shall not (a) be used as a basis
for interpreting the terms "material", "Company Material Adverse Effect" or
other similar terms in this Agreement or to establish a standard
of materiality, (b) represent a determination that such item or matter did
not arise in the ordinary course of business, (c) be deemed or interpreted to
expand the scope of any Partys representations and warranties,
obligations, covenants, conditions or agreements contained herein, (d)
constitute, or be deemed to constitute, an admission of liability or
obligation regarding such matter, (e) represent a determination that the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement requires the
consent of any third party, (f) constitute, or be deemed to constitute, an
admission to any third party concerning such item or matter or (g) constitute,
or be deemed to constitute, an admission or indication by the Company that
such item meets any or all of the criteria set forth in this Agreement for
inclusion in the Disclosure Schedule. No reference in the Disclosure Schedule
to any Contract or other agreement or document shall be construed as an
admission or indication that such Contract, agreement or document is
enforceable or currently in effect or that there are any obligations remaining
to be performed or any rights that may be exercised under such Contract,
agreement or document. No disclosure in the Disclosure Schedule relating to
any possible breach or violation of any agreement or Law shall be construed as
an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred.

 



63 Section 9.9 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted
assigns and, except as provided in the following sentence of this _Section_ __
_ 9.9_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable rights, benefits or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, (a) the current
and former officers and directors of the Group Companies shall be third party
beneficiaries of the provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.6_, and (b)
Schiff shall be a third party beneficiary of the provisions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.18_.

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not invalidate or render unenforceable
such term or provision in any other jurisdiction, and all other provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby
be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 9.11 _Counterparts; Delivery_. This Agreement may be executed in
multiple original, PDF or facsimile counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original, and all of which taken together shall be considered one
and the same agreement. In the event that any signature to this Agreement or
any agreement or certificate delivered pursuant hereto, or any amendment
thereof, is delivered by facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery of a
".pdf" format data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding
obligation of the Party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is
executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or ".pdf"
signature page were an original thereof. No Party shall raise the use of a
facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to deliver
any such signature page or the fact that such signature was transmitted or
communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of
a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation or enforceability of
a contract and each Party forever waives any such defense.

 

Section 9.12 _Knowledge_. For all purposes of this Agreement, the phrase "to
the knowledge of the Company" and any derivations thereof shall mean, as of
the applicable date, the actual knowledge (and shall in no event encompass
constructive knowledge) after due inquiry of Steve Fuhrman, Kevin Powers,
Gregory Shunk, Timothy Hitchcock and Hugh J. Barger III, none of whom shall
have any personal liability or obligations regarding such knowledge.

Section 9.13 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement, Buyer agrees and acknowledges that no recourse
under this Agreement, any Ancillary Document, or any documents or instruments
delivered in connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary Document, or any
transaction contemplated by the foregoing, shall be had against any current or
future equity holder (other than a Stockholder in its capacity as such in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the applicable Letters
of Transmittal), partner, member, controlling person, director, officer,
employee, incorporator, manager, Representative or Affiliate of any
Stockholder or the Stockholder Representative (or any Affiliate of any of the
foregoing) (each, a " _Nonparty Affiliate_ "), whether by the enforcement of
any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any
Law, it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability
whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any
Nonparty Affiliate for any obligation of the Company or any Stockholder or the
Stockholder Representative under this Agreement, any Ancillary Document, any
documents or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document, or any transaction contemplated by the foregoing, for any
claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their
creation.

 



64 Section 9.14 _Court Proceedings; Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), in any such
proceeding, agrees that all claims in respect of any such proceeding may be
heard and determined in such court and agrees not to bring any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating thereto in any other court. Each of the
Parties waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any
such proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that
might be required of any other Party with respect thereto.

 

Section 9.15 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, FOR ANY PROCEEDING WHICH IS PERMITTED
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT TO BE FILED IN A COURT, EACH PARTY HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN SUCH PROCEEDING, INCLUDING
THOSE PROCEEDINGS TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OF THE ANCILLARY DOCUMENTS OR UNDER ANY AMENDMENT, CONSENT, WAIVER,
INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT DELIVERED OR WHICH MAY IN THE FUTURE BE
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF THEM OR ARISING FROM ANY RELATIONSHIP
EXISTING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE ANCILLARY DOCUMENTS.
EACH PARTY AGREES THAT IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING, THE MATTERS SHALL BE TRIED TO A
COURT AND NOT TO A JURY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY
SUCH PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION_ __ _ 9.15_.

 

Section 9.16 _Service of Process_. Each Party irrevocably consents to the
service of summons and complaint and any other process outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in _Section_ __ _ 9.14_
hereof in any proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement by
sending or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the
address of the Party and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in
_Section_ __ _ 9.4_ hereof (except that email or facsimile shall not be
permitted delivery means pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 9.16_). Nothing
herein shall affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other
manner permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 9.17 _Specific Enforcement_. Except as otherwise expressly provided
herein, any and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with
and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or conferred by Law or
equity, upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree
that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not
perform their respective obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It
is accordingly agreed that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article 7_ , the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, and hereby waives (a) any defenses in any action for an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief, including the
defense that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity, and (b) any requirement under Law to post a bond, undertaking or
other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. To the extent
any Party hereto brings an action, suit or proceeding to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an
action to enforce specifically any provision that expressly survives
termination of this Agreement), the Termination Date shall automatically be
extended to (i) the 20th Business Day following the resolution of such
action, suit or proceeding or (ii) such other time period established by the
court presiding over such action, suit or proceeding.

 



65 Section 9.18 _Conflicts; Privileges_.

 

(a) _Acknowledgement of Representation_. It is acknowledged by each of the
Parties that the Stockholder Representative and the Company have retained
Schiff Hardin LLP (" _Schiff_ ") to act as their counsel in connection with
this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents, the Confidentiality Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby or thereby (the " _Current Representation_
"), and that no other Party to this Agreement has the status of a client of
Schiff for conflict of interest or any other purposes as a result thereof.

 

(b) _Affirmation of Representation_. Buyer and the Company hereby agree that,
and each agrees to cause each Group Company to agree that, after the Closing,
Schiff may represent the Stockholder Representative, any Stockholder, and any
officer, director, manager, employee, shareholder, partner or member of the
Stockholder Representative and/or any Stockholder (any such Person, a "
_Designated Person_ ") in any matter involving or arising from the Current
Representation, including any interpretation or application of this Agreement,
any Ancillary Document or the Confidentiality Agreement, and including for
the avoidance of doubt any litigation, arbitration, dispute or mediation
between or among Buyer, any Group Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, and any Designated Person, even though the interests of such
Designated Person may be directly adverse to Buyer, a Group Company or any of
their respective Affiliates, and even though Schiff may have represented a
Group Company in a substantially related matter, or may be representing Buyer
or a Group Company in ongoing matters.

 

(c) _Waiver of Conflict_. Buyer and the Company hereby waive and agree not to
assert, and each agrees to cause each other Group Company to waive and not
assert, (i) any claim that Schiff has a conflict of interest in any
representation described in _Section_ __ _ 9.18(b)_ above, and (ii) any
confidentiality obligation with respect to any communication between Schiff
and any Designated Person occurring during the Current Representation.

(d) _Retention of Privilege_. Buyer and the Company hereby agree that, and
each agrees to cause each Group Company to agree that, as to all
communications (whether before, at or after the Closing) between Schiff and
any Designated Person that relate in any way to the Current
Representation, the attorney-client privilege and all rights to any other
evidentiary privilege, and the protections afforded to information relating to
representation of a client under applicable rules of professional conduct,
belong to such Designated Person and may be controlled by such Designated
Person and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or any Group Company.
Without limiting the foregoing, notwithstanding any policy of Buyer or any
Group Company or any agreement between any Group Company and any Designated
Person or any Representative of any Designated Person or any Group Company,
whether established or entered into before, at or after the Closing, neither
Buyer nor any Group Company may use for any purpose in connection with any
Action adverse to a Designated Person, without such Designated Persons
written consent, or seek to compel disclosure to Buyer or any Group Company
(or any of their Representatives) any communication or information (whether
written, oral, electronic or in any other medium) described in the previous
sentence, in each case, unless privilege has otherwise been waived with
respect to such communication or information.

 



66 (e) _Further Assurances_. Buyer and the Company agree to take, and to cause
their respective Affiliates to take, all steps necessary to implement the
intent of this _Section_ __ _ 9.18(e)_. Buyer, the Stockholder Representative
and the Company further agree that Schiff and its partners and employees are
third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 9.18(e)_.

Section 9.19 _Remedies Exclusive_. From and after the Closing, the Parties
hereto hereby irrevocably waive any other rights or remedies (whether at law
or in equity and whether based on contract, tort, statute or otherwise) that
they may otherwise have had, now have or may in the future have against any of
the other Parties hereto or any of the respective direct or indirect
Affiliates, officers, managers, directors, employees, advisors, stockholders,
members, consultants, investment bankers, brokers, controlling persons,
partners, managers or other representatives or agents thereof (each of whom
shall be an express third party beneficiary hereof) arising from, or directly
or indirectly relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and covenant not to sue or otherwise assert any claim (or
assist any other Person in suing or otherwise asserting any claim) encompassed
by the foregoing covenant, agreement and waiver; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not apply (i) to the Parties rights with respect to the
final determination of any adjustment to the Closing Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.8, but subject to the limits, terms and conditions
set forth therein, including, without limitation, Section 2.8(i), (ii) to any
representations of the Stockholders set forth in the Letter of Transmittal or
any Ancillary Agreement or (iii) in the event of Actual Fraud. Any Person who
is sued or otherwise has a claim asserted against him, her or it in violation
of this _Section_ __ _ 9.19_ may enforce it directly as an express third-
party beneficiary thereof.

 

Section 9.20 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

Section 9.21 _The Stockholder Representative_.

 

(a) _Appointment_. Each Stockholder, by approving the Merger and consenting to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or by execution and delivery
of a Letter of Transmittal, will have irrevocably appointed the Stockholder
Representative as the sole and exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact of such
Stockholder to act on behalf of such Stockholder regarding any matter relating
to or arising under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including for the purposes of: (1) receiving
or directing any payments due from Buyer or the Escrow Agent at or following
the Closing that are required under the terms of this Agreement to be paid to
any of the Stockholders; (2) taking any action on behalf of Stockholders or
any individual Stockholder that may be necessary or desirable, as determined
by the Stockholder Representative in its sole discretion, in connection with
the amendment of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ or the
Escrow Agreement in accordance with its terms; (3) taking any action on
behalf of Stockholders or any individual Stockholder that may be necessary or
desirable, as determined by the Stockholder Representative in its sole
discretion, in connection with negotiating or entering into settlements,
resolutions and compromises with respect to the adjustments or payments
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.8_; (4) accepting notices on behalf of the
Stockholders or any individual Stockholder in accordance with _Section_ __ _
9.4_; (5) executing and delivering, on behalf of the Stockholders or any
individual Stockholder, any notices, documents or certificates to be executed
by the Stockholders or any individual Stockholder in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (6) granting
any consent or approval on behalf of the Stockholders or any individual
Stockholder under this Agreement; (7) holding any funds with respect to the
Representative Holdback Amount and using and disbursing such funds in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.21(g)_; and (8) any other matter
contemplated to be taken by or on behalf of the Stockholders or any
individual Stockholder under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or
otherwise contemplated to be performed by the Stockholder Representative.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative shall have
no obligation to act on behalf of the Stockholders, except as expressly
provided herein, in the Escrow Agreement and in the Stockholder Representative
Engagement Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of
the Stockholder Representative in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit
or the Disclosure Schedule. As the representative of the Stockholders or any
individual Stockholder under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, the
Stockholder Representative shall act as the agent for each and shall have
authority to bind each Stockholder and their successors as if expressly
confirmed and ratified in writing and all defenses which may be available to
any Stockholder to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Stockholder
Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement, in the Escrow
Agreement or the Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement are waived.



 



67 (b) _Reliance_. Buyer may rely exclusively, without independent verification
or investigation, upon all decisions, communications or writings made, given
or executed by the Stockholder Representative or actions omitted to be taken
by it in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Buyer is entitled to deal exclusively with the Stockholder
Representative on all matters relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to the extent specified in this Agreement. Any
action taken or not taken or decisions, communications or writings made,
given or executed by the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed an action
taken or not taken or decisions, communications or writings made, given or
executed by such Stockholder. Any notice or communication delivered by Buyer
to the Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have been delivered to
all Stockholders. Buyer shall be entitled to disregard any decisions,
communications or writings made, given or executed by any Stockholder in
connection with this Agreement and any transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless the same is made, given or executed by the Stockholder
Representative. The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely
upon the Payment Spreadsheet (as such term is defined in the Stockholder
Representative Engagement Agreement), (ii) rely upon any signature believed by
it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper
authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Stockholder or other party.

(c) _Appointment as  Attorney-in-Fact and Agent_. Each Stockholder, by
approving the Merger and consenting to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or by execution and delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, will have
irrevocably appointed the Stockholder Representative as such Stockholders
true and lawful attorney-in-fact and exclusive agent, with full powers of
substitution and resubstitution, in such Stockholders name, place and stead,
in any and all capacities, in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement, the Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, granting unto said attorney-in-
fact and exclusive agent, full power and authority to do and perform each and
every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in connection with
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Stockholder Representative
Engagement Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
fully to all intents and purposes as such Stockholder might or could do in
person.

 



68 (d) _Limitation on Liability of the Stockholder Representative_. The Company
has entered into an engagement agreement (the " _Stockholder Representative
Engagement Agreement_ ") with the Stockholder Representative to provide
direction to the Stockholder Representative in connection with its services
under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, which provides for, among
other things, one or more Stockholders or individual representatives thereof
to act in an advisory capacity to the Stockholder Representative (such
Stockholders, including their individual representatives, collectively
hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory Group_ ") and for the Stockholder
Representative Engagement Agreement to be assigned prior to or at Closing to
one or more Stockholders. Except for Actual Fraud or willful misconduct on
its part, neither the Stockholder Representative nor its members, managers,
directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the
Advisory Group (collectively, the " _Stockholder Representative Group_ "),
shall have any liability to any Stockholder under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement for any act
or omission by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of any
Stockholder. The Stockholders, severally and not on a joint and several
basis, will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stockholder Representative
Group from and against any and all loss, liability, damage, claim, penalty,
fine, forfeiture, action, fee, judgment, amount paid in settlement cost and
expense (including the fees and expenses of counsel, other skilled
professionals, experts and their staffs and all expense of document location,
duplication and shipment and in connection with seeking recovery from
insurers) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in
connection with the Stockholder Representatives execution and performance of
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Stockholder Representative
Engagement Agreement and any transaction contemplated by this Agreement
(including the allocation of any payment to be made to any Stockholders
hereunder (in their capacities as such) or under the Escrow Agreement), in
each case as such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; _provided_ ,
that in the event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to
have been primarily caused by the Actual Fraud or willful misconduct of the
Stockholder Representative, the Stockholder Representative will reimburse
such Stockholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss
attributable to such Actual Fraud or willful misconduct. If not paid directly
to the Stockholder Representative by the Stockholders, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Stockholder Representative from
the Representative Holdback Amount; _provided_ , that while this section
allows the Stockholder Representative to be paid from the Representative
Holdback Amount, this does not relieve the Stockholders from their obligation
to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Stockholder Representative from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. The Stockholders acknowledge that the
Stockholder Representative shall not be required to expend or risk its own
funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or
performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby. Furthermore, the Stockholder Representative shall not be required
to take any action unless the Stockholder Representative has been provided
with funds, security or indemnities which, in its reasonable determination,
are sufficient to protect the Stockholder Representative against the costs,
expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the Stockholder
Representative in performing such actions.

(e) _Retention of Counsel_. The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled
to retain counsel (including Schiff) and to incur such fees, costs and
expenses as the Stockholder Representative deems to be necessary or
appropriate in connection with the performance of their obligations under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Stockholder Representative shall be
reimbursed for all such fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees, costs and expenses) in accordance with _Section_ __ _
9.21(g)_.

 

(f) _Survival_. All of the immunities and powers granted to the Stockholder
Representative Group under this Agreement shall survive the resignation or
removal of the Stockholder Representative and/or any member of the Advisory
Group, the Closing, or any termination of this Agreement. The grant of
authority and immunities and rights to indemnification provided herein are
coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death,
incompetency, bankruptcy, dissolution, winding up or liquidation of any
Stockholder and shall be binding on any successor thereto.

 



69 (g) _Representative Holdback Amount_. The Stockholder Representative shall
hold the Representative Holdback Amount as a fund from which the Stockholder
Representative shall reimburse itself for or pay directly any fees, expenses
or costs that the Stockholder Representative incurs in performing its duties
and obligations under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or in connection
with any transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including fees and
expenses incurred pursuant to the procedures and provisions set forth herein
and legal and consultant fees, expenses and costs for reviewing, analyzing
and defending any claim or process arising under or pursuant to this
Agreement. The Stockholders will not receive any interest or earnings on the
Representative Holdback Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Stockholder Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have
had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholder Representative is not
acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with
the Representative Holdback Amount and has no tax reporting or income
distribution obligations. The Stockholder Representative will not be liable
for any loss of principal of the Representative Holdback Amount. As soon as
reasonably determined by the Stockholder Representative that the
Representative Holdback Amount is no longer required to be withheld, the
Stockholder Representative shall pay to the Paying Agent, after paying all
amounts from the Representative Holdback Amount that constitute Profit
Sharing Plan Adjustment Payments to the account or accounts designated by the
Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for further
distribution to each Stockholder (subject to each such Stockholders
delivery of a properly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal) such
Stockholders Percentage Share of the remainder of the Representative Holdback
Amount.
