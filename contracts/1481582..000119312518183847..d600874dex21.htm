 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(d) <I>Limitation on Liability of the Stockholder Representative</I>. The Company has entered
into an engagement agreement (the &#147;<U>Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement</U>&#148;) with the Stockholder Representative to provide direction to the Stockholder Representative in connection with its services under this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement, which provides for, among other things, one or more Stockholders or individual representatives thereof to act in an advisory capacity to the Stockholder Representative (such Stockholders, including their individual
representatives, collectively hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<U>Advisory Group</U>&#148;) and for the Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement to be assigned prior to or at Closing to one or more Stockholders. Except for Actual Fraud or
willful misconduct on its part, neither the Stockholder Representative nor its members, managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the &#147;<U>Stockholder Representative
Group</U>&#148;), shall have any liability to any Stockholder under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Stockholder Representative Engagement Agreement for any act or omission by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of any Stockholder.
The Stockholders, severally and not on a joint and several basis, will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stockholder Representative Group from and against any and all loss, liability, damage, claim, penalty, fine, forfeiture, action, fee,
judgment, amount paid in settlement cost and expense (including the fees and expenses of counsel, other skilled professionals, experts and their staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment and in connection with seeking
recovery from insurers) (collectively, &#147;<U>Representative Losses</U>&#148;) arising out of or in connection with the Stockholder Representative&#146;s execution and performance of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Stockholder
Representative Engagement Agreement and any transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including the allocation of any payment to be made to any Stockholders hereunder (in their capacities as such) or under the Escrow Agreement), in each case as
such Representative Loss is suffered or incurred; <U>provided</U>, that in the event that any such Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been primarily caused by the Actual Fraud or willful misconduct of the Stockholder Representative,
the Stockholder Representative will reimburse such Stockholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss attributable to such Actual Fraud or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Stockholder Representative by the Stockholders,
any such Representative Losses may be recovered by the Stockholder Representative from the Representative Holdback Amount; <U>provided</U>, that while this section allows the Stockholder Representative to be paid from the Representative Holdback
Amount, this does not relieve the Stockholders from their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law or
otherwise. The Stockholders acknowledge that the Stockholder Representative shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties or
privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the Stockholder Representative shall not be required to take any action unless the Stockholder Representative has been
provided with funds, security or indemnities which, in its reasonable determination, are sufficient to protect the Stockholder Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by the Stockholder Representative in
performing such actions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(e) <I>Retention of Counsel</I>. The Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to retain counsel (including
Schiff) and to incur such fees, costs and expenses as the Stockholder Representative deems to be necessary or appropriate in connection with the performance of their obligations under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Stockholder
Representative shall be reimbursed for all such fees, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees, costs and expenses) in accordance with <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;9.21(g)</U>. </P>

resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative and/or any member of the Advisory Group, the Closing, or any termination of this Agreement. The grant of authority and immunities and rights to indemnification provided herein are coupled with
an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy, dissolution, winding up or liquidation of any Stockholder and shall be binding on any successor thereto. </P>

Representative Holdback Amount as a fund from which the Stockholder Representative shall reimburse itself for or pay directly any fees, expenses or costs that the Stockholder Representative incurs in performing its duties and obligations under this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement or in connection with any transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including fees and expenses incurred pursuant to the procedures and provisions set forth herein and legal and consultant fees, expenses and
costs for reviewing, analyzing and defending any claim or process arising under or pursuant to this Agreement. The Stockholders will not receive any interest or earnings on the Representative Holdback Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to
the Stockholder Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholder Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the<B>
</B>Representative Holdback Amount and has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations. The Stockholder Representative will not be liable for any loss of principal of the Representative Holdback Amount. As soon as reasonably determined by
the Stockholder Representative that the Representative Holdback Amount is no longer required to be withheld, the Stockholder Representative shall pay to the Paying Agent, after paying all amounts from the Representative Holdback Amount that
constitute Profit Sharing Plan Adjustment Payments to the account or accounts designated by the Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for further distribution to each Stockholder (subject to each such Stockholder&#146;s delivery
of a properly completed and executed Letter of Transmittal) such Stockholder&#146;s Percentage Share of the remainder of the Representative Holdback Amount. </P>
