(e) all Liabilities set forth in _Section 2.4(e)_ of the Business Disclosure
Schedule.

 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and for the avoidance of
doubt, the fact that a Liability may fall under the definition of "Assumed
Liabilities" and may have been assumed by the Buyer hereunder, shall not in
any respect prevent Buyer from seeking or receiving indemnification hereunder
with respect to such Liability to the extent the Buyer is entitled
to indemnity with respect to such liability or obligation pursuant to the
terms of _Article VII_. For explanation purposes, if a Liability is an Assumed
Liability but also constitutes a breach of a representation and warranty made
by Seller, Buyer shall be entitled to be indemnified with respect to such
Liability from the Seller Stockholders pursuant to _Article VII_.

2.5  _Excluded Liabilities_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Buyer shall not assume (or be deemed to assume) or be obligated
to pay, perform or otherwise discharge any Excluded Liabilities, and all

three (3) business days) after the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions
set forth in _Article VI_ hereof (other than those conditions that, by their
terms, are not capable of being satisfied or waived until the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), or
such other date or place as may be mutually agreed to in writing by the
Parties (the " _Closing Date_ ").

 

2.7 _Non-Transferable Contracts_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, if any Transferred Contract is not assignable or transferable (each,
a " _Non-Transferable Contract_ ") without a Consent, and any such Consent is
not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement and the related
instruments of transfer shall not constitute an assignment or transfer of
such Non-Transferable Contract, and Buyer shall not assume Sellers rights or
obligations under such Non-Transferable Contract, and instead Seller shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to obtain any such Consent as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date and thereafter Seller shall
transfer and assign to Buyer

 



-22-  such Non-Transferable Contract. For the avoidance of doubt, as between
Seller and Buyer, except as set forth in this _Section 2.7_, Non-Transferable
Contracts shall be treated as Transferred Contracts for all purposes under
this Agreement. After the Closing, Seller shall use reasonable commercial
efforts to provide Buyer with all of the rights and benefits of any Non-
Transferable Contracts after the Closing as if the appropriate Consent had
been obtained, including by granting subleases, sublicenses or other rights
and establishing arrangements whereby Buyer shall have the benefits of and
shall bear the burdens of and undertake the obligation to perform under the
Non-Transferable Contracts (including enforcement for the benefit of Buyer of
any and all rights of Seller against any other party arising out of any breach
or cancellation of any such Non-Transferable Contracts by such other party
and, if requested by Buyer, taking such other actions as Buyer shall
otherwise reasonably require). Any costs incurred by Seller after the Closing
in order to comply with this _Section 2.7_ shall be borne by Buyer.

 

2.8 _Escrow_.

(a)  _Establishment of Escrow Fund_. At and upon the Closing, Buyer shall
deposit with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount in order to provide a fund for
the payment of (i) any claims for which Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled
to indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ (it being understood that
the General Escrow Fund shall be funded solely for the benefit of satisfying
obligations of the Seller Stockholders and shall not be available to satisfy
any claims against Seller or its affiliates under _Section 7.2(c)_) and (ii)
any amounts that may be owed to Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)_. Buyer
shall remit the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Escrow Agent, to
be held pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement substantially in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_. The General Escrow Amount deposited with
the Escrow Agent plus all accrued interest thereon shall be referred to as
the " _General Escrow Fund_ ", and the Working Capital Escrow Amount deposited
with the Escrow Agent plus all accrued interest thereon shall be referred to
as the " _Working Capital Escrow Fund_ " (and together, the General Escrow
Fund and the Working Capital Escrow Fund shall be referred to as the " _Escrow
Fund_ "). Each Party agrees to provide appropriate instructions, as
necessary, to the Escrow Agent for disbursement of any amounts owing to the
other Party from the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Agreement, including clauses
(i) and (ii) of this _Section 2.8(a)_.

 

(b) _Distribution of General Escrow Fund_. To the extent any funds from the
General Escrow Amount remain in the General Escrow Fund as of the end of the
Escrow Period (the " _Release Date_ ") (after payment from such General Escrow
Fund of all amounts determined to be due to Buyer by the Seller Stockholders
under _Article VII_ for any claims for which Buyer Indemnified Parties are
entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_), the Seller
Stockholder Representative and Buyer shall provide joint instructions to
Escrow Agent, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, within five (5)
business days after the Release Date, to disburse all such remaining funds in
excess of the aggregate amount of Losses specified in all Claim Certificates
received by the Seller Stockholder Representative prior to the Release Date to
the Seller (for subsequent distribution to the former equity holders of
Seller pursuant to the Merger Agreement), but only to the extent that such
claims are pending and unresolved as of the Release Date and the amount of
such Losses has been paid or incurred or could reasonably be expected to be
incurred as

 



-23-  determined in good faith by Buyer (such amount, the " _Reserved Funds_ ").
As promptly as practicable, and in any event no later than five (5) business
days, following the resolution of any such pending claim, the Buyer and the
Seller Stockholder Representative shall provide joint instructions to the
Escrow Agent, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, to (i) transfer to the
applicable Buyer Indemnified Parties, the portion of the General Escrow Fund
required to satisfy such claim, if any, and (ii) transfer to the Seller (for
subsequent distribution to the former equity holders of Seller pursuant to the
Merger Agreement) the excess of the balance of the General Escrow Fund
remaining on deposit with the Escrow Agent as of such date, if any, following
the transfer in clause (i), over the remaining Reserved Funds (calculated
after giving effect to such resolution). Thereafter (i.e., after such initial
release of amounts other than Reserved Funds), within ten (10) business days
following the date on which all such pending claims have been fully and
finally resolved, the Seller Stockholder Representative and Buyer
shall provide joint instructions to Escrow Agent to disburse any amounts then
remaining in the General Escrow Fund to the Seller (for subsequent
distribution to the former equity holders of Seller pursuant to the Merger
Agreement).

 

(c) _Distribution of Working Capital Escrow Fund_. The release and
distribution of the Working Capital Escrow Amount from the Working Capital
Escrow Fund shall be governed by _Section 2.9(b)(ii)_.

2.9 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(a) _Closing Adjustment_. At least four (4) business days before the Closing,
Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer (A) a statement (the " _Estimated
Closing Working Capital Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail
Sellers good faith estimates of the Closing Working Capital and each
component thereof, and all supporting calculations, schedules, and
documentation therefor (the " _Estimated Closing Working Capital_ "), and (B)
a certificate of the chief financial officer of Seller that the Estimated
Closing Working Capital Statement was prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Policies. By way of illustration, a sample calculation of Estimated
Closing Working Capital as of March 31, 2016 is set forth on _Schedule 2.9_
attached hereto. The Parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
dispute related to the calculation of the Estimated Closing Working Capital
within three (3) business days of Sellers delivery of the Estimated Closing
Working Capital Statement and, to the extent applicable, such
estimated amount shall be adjusted to reflect any changes mutually agreed to
by the Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Parties are unable to
reach agreement within such three (3) business day period with respect to any
such dispute, the Buyer shall nevertheless proceed to the Closing, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth herein, and, in such an event, Buyer shall
pay to Sellers at the Closing the Closing Payment determined based upon the
Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement as delivered by Seller (it being
understood that with respect to any unresolved items, the Estimated Closing
Working Capital Statement as delivered by Seller shall control solely for
purposes of determining the amounts payable at the Closing, but shall not
limit or otherwise affect Buyers remedies under this Agreement or otherwise,
or constitute an acknowledgement by Buyer of the accuracy of the amounts
reflected thereof). The Closing Payment shall be increased or decreased,
respectively, dollar-for-dollar by the amount that the Estimated Closing
Working Capital is more than or less than $3,150,000 (the " _Target Working
Capital_ ") (such increase or decrease, as applicable, the " _Closing Payment
Adjustment_ ").

 



-24- (b) _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

(i) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and
deliver to the Seller Stockholder Representative, with a copy to Seller, a
statement (the " _Closing Working Capital Statement_ ") setting forth in
reasonable detail its good faith determination of Closing Working Capital (and
each component thereof), and all supporting calculations, schedules, and
documentation therefor, and the Adjustment Amount, if any, payable pursuant to
_Section 2.9(b)(ii)_, which statement shall include certificate of the chief
financial officer of Buyer that the Closing Working Capital Statement was
prepared in accordance with the Accounting Policies. " _Adjustment Amount_ "
shall mean the amount equal to (i) the Closing Working Capital __minus__ (ii)
the sum of (x) the Estimated Closing Working Capital __plus__ , (y) solely to
the extent that there is an increase in deferred revenue (general ledger
account range 23000 and 23500) not included in the sample calculation of
Estimated Closing Working Capital as of March 31, 2016 as set forth on
_Schedule 2.9_ attached hereto (general ledger accounts 23060, 23200, 23290,
23605 and 23610) exceeding $100,000 in the aggregate between March 31, 2016
and the Closing, an amount equal to 50% of such increase in deferred revenue
as of the Measurement Time.

(ii) Within ten (10) business days after the Closing Working
Capital Statement, the Adjustment Amount and all Disputed Amounts are
determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 2.9(c)_,
(A) if the Adjustment Amount is a positive number in excess of $50,000, then
the Working Capital Escrow Fund shall be released to the Seller (for
subsequent distribution to the former equity holders of Seller pursuant to the
Merger Agreement) and Buyer shall pay to the Seller (for subsequent
distribution to the former equity holders of Seller pursuant to the Merger
Agreement) an amount equal to such Adjustment Amount, and (B) if the
Adjustment Amount is a negative number with an absolute value in excess of
$50,000, then (1) to the extent the Working Capital Escrow Amount is equal to
or exceeds the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount, the Adjustment Amount
shall be released to Buyer from the Working Capital Escrow Fund and the
remaining Working Capital Escrow Amount, if any, shall be released to the
Seller (for subsequent distribution to the former equity holders of Seller
pursuant to the Merger Agreement); and (2) to the extent the absolute value of
the Adjustment Amount exceeds the Working Capital Escrow Amount, the entire
Working Capital Escrow Amount shall be released to Buyer and the Buyer may
recover the amount of such excess solely from the General Escrow Fund. For
purposes of clarification, no adjustment shall be made to the Purchase Price
if the Adjustment Amount, as finally determined in accordance with this
_Section 2.9_, is a positive or negative number with an absolute value less
than or equal to $50,000 and the entirety of the Working Capital Escrow Amount
shall be released to the Seller (for subsequent distribution to the former
equity holders of Seller pursuant to the Merger Agreement). Within ten (10)
business days after the Closing Working Capital Statement, the Adjustment
Amount and all Disputed Amounts are determined in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Section 2.9(c)_, the Buyer and the Seller
Stockholder Representative shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to
Buyer or the Seller (for subsequent distribution to the former equity holders
of Seller pursuant to the Merger Agreement) any amounts due either of them
under this _Section 2.9(b)(ii)_.

 



-25- (c) _Examination and Review_.

 

(i) After receipt of the Closing Working Capital Statement, the Seller
Stockholder Representative shall have thirty (30) days (the " _Review Period_
") to review the Closing Working Capital Statement. During such Review Period,
the Seller Stockholder Representative and its accountants shall have
reasonable access to the books and records (via electronic means to the
extent available) of the Business, as the Seller Stockholder Representative
may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the Closing Working
Capital Statement, to the extent that they relate to the Closing Working
Capital Statement, and Buyer and Seller shall make available its employees
and outside accountants knowledgeable about the information used in, and the
preparation of, the Closing Working Capital Statement, (subject to any
limitations that are reasonably required to preserve any applicable attorney-
client privilege, protect any proprietary or confidential information
unrelated to the Business, or comply with third-party confidentiality
obligations); _provided_ , _however_ , that such access does not unreasonably
disrupt the normal operations of the business of Buyer or Seller. Any dispute
regarding whether access was reasonable will be resolved by the Accountant and
shall be final and binding.

 

(ii) On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, the Seller Stockholder
Representative may object to the Closing Working Capital Statement by
delivering to Buyer a written statement setting forth the Seller Stockholder
Representatives objections in reasonable detail, indicating each disputed
item or amount and the basis for Sellers disagreement therewith (the "
_Statement of Objections_ "). If the Seller Stockholder Representative fails
to deliver such Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review
Period, the Closing Working Capital Statement and the Adjustment Amount, as
the case may be, reflected in the Closing Working Capital Statement prepared
by Buyer shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Seller Stockholder
Representative. If the Seller Stockholder Representative delivers the
Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, Buyer and
the Seller Stockholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
such objections within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Statement of
Objections (the " _Objection Resolution Period_ "), and, if the same are so
resolved within the Objection Resolution Period, the Adjustment Amount and the
Closing Working Capital Statement with such changes as may have been
previously agreed in writing by Buyer and the Seller Stockholder
Representative, shall be final and binding.

(iii) If the Seller Stockholder Representative and Buyer fail to reach an
agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of
Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any amounts
remaining in dispute (" _Disputed Amounts_ ") may be referred by either Party
to the Accountant (as selected and defined pursuant to _Section 2.12_) for
resolution, and the determination of the Accountant shall be final and binding
upon all Parties, and the fees and expenses of the Accountant shall be paid
fifty percent (50%) by the Seller Stockholder Representative (solely on behalf
of the Seller Stockholders) and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer.

 

(iv) The Accountant shall determine only those items remaining in dispute
between Buyer and the Seller Stockholder Representative, and
its determination with respect to any amount shall not be more favorable to
Buyer than the amount thereof shown in Buyers calculations nor more favorable
to the Seller Stockholder Representative than the amount thereof shown in the
Seller Stockholder Representatives calculations delivered pursuant to this
_Section 2.9_. The

 



-26-  Accountant shall make a determination as soon as practicable within thirty
(30) days (or such other time as the Accountant may reasonably require or as
the Parties shall agree in writing) after their engagement, and shall provide
its reasonable basis for its determination, and, absent fraud or manifest
error, its resolution of the Disputed Amounts and adjustments to the Closing
Working Capital Statement and/or the Adjustment Amount shall be conclusive
and binding upon the Parties. Each of Buyer and the Seller Stockholder
Representative shall (A) enter into a customary engagement letter with the
Accountant at the time such dispute is submitted to the Accountant
and otherwise cooperate with the Accountant, (B) have the opportunity to
submit a written statement in support of their respective positions with
respect to such disputed items, to provide supporting material to the
Accountant in defense of their respective positions with respect to such
disputed items and to submit a written statement and supporting material
responding to the other Partys position with respect to such disputed items
and (C) subject to customary confidentiality and indemnity agreements,
provide the Accountant with access to their respective books, records,
personnel and representatives and such other information as the Accountant may
require in order to render its determination. There shall be no ex
parte communications between either Party and the Accountant.

(v) Except as otherwise provided herein, any payment of the Adjustment
Amount shall be, without interest, and paid to Buyer within ten (10) business
days of acceptance of the applicable Closing Working Capital Statement, or if
there are Disputed Amounts then within ten (10) business days of the
resolution described in _clause (iv)_ above.

materials as reasonably requested by Buyer after the date hereof, the Buyer
shall prepare and deliver to the Seller Stockholder Representative, at the
Closing, an allocation of the Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities (to the
extent properly taken into account) among the Transferred Assets in accordance
with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (the "
_Asset Acquisition Statement_ "). Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to
provide a good faith estimate of such allocation (by taking into account the
Target Working Capital and not taking into account any adjustment pursuant to
Section 2.9(a)) no later than ten (10) business days prior to the Closing
Date. Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to provide Seller and the
Converge Buyer with an estimate of the Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities
attributable to Icontrol Canada as soon as practicable after its receipt of
the Estimated Closing Working Capital Statement. Within four (4) days of (i)
any payment pursuant to this Agreement that is treated as a Purchase Price
adjustment for Tax purposes, or (ii) Buyer determining that one or more non-

revised Asset Acquisition Statement. The Seller Stockholder Representative
shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of the Asset Acquisition Statement,
to notify the Buyer in writing of any objections. If the Seller Stockholder
Representative does not object in writing during such 30-day period,
the Asset Acquisition Statement shall be final and binding on all Parties. If
the Seller Stockholder Representative objects in writing during such 30-day
period, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to reach a mutually
agreeable allocation of the Purchase Price, which allocation shall be binding
on all Parties. If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement within fifteen
(15) days of the Buyers receipt of the Seller Stockholder Representatives
objections to the Asset Acquisition Statement (the " _Resolution Period_ "),
any disputed items shall be referred to the Accountant (as selected and
defined below) for resolution, and the determination of the Accountant shall
be final and binding upon all Parties. The fees and expenses of the
Accountant shall be divided equally among the Buyer and the Seller Stockholder
Representative (solely on behalf of the Seller Stockholders). No Party shall
take any Tax position inconsistent with such final allocation. If the Seller
Stockholder Representative and Buyer are not able to resolve all disputed
items identified by the Seller Stockholder Representative in its notice to
Buyer within the time periods described above, then the items that remain in
dispute shall be submitted to Deloitte and Touche LLP, or if Deloitte and Touche
LLP declines to serve, a jointly selected internationally recognized
accounting firm that is not the independent auditor for either the
Seller Stockholder Representative (or any of its affiliates) or Buyer (or any
of its affiliates), which firm shall, within ten (10) days, select a partner
from such firm to act as arbitrator who does not have any prior contacts with
the Seller Stockholder Representative or Buyer that reasonably would be
expected to affect such partners ability to be impartial; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Seller Stockholder Representative and Buyer are unable
to select such accounting firm within fifteen (15) days after the end of the
Resolution Period, either Buyer or the Seller Stockholder Representative may
request the American Arbitration Association to appoint, within fifteen (15)
days from the date of such request, a partner meeting the criteria set forth
above with significant arbitration experience related to purchase price
adjustment disputes. The individual partner selected by the accounting firm or
the American Arbitration Association, as the case may be, shall be referred
to herein as the " _Accountant_."

in good faith.

 

2.14 _Further Assurances_. On and after the Closing, upon the reasonable
request of a Party, each of the other applicable Parties shall prepare,
execute and deliver such other and further agreements, instruments,
certificates and other documents, and take, do and perform such other and
further actions, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order to

respective affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further
conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases and acquittances and such other
instruments, and shall take such further actions, as may be reasonably
necessary or appropriate to transfer and deliver to Buyer and its successors

Agreement, and to assure the assumption by Buyer from Seller and its
affiliates and their successors and assigns of the liabilities and
obligations intended to be assumed by Buyer under this Agreement, and to
otherwise make effective the transactions contemplated hereby. Without
limiting the generality of this _Section 2.14_, Seller will cooperate with
Buyer with respect to enforcing any warranty that may exist with respect to
Transferred Equipment procured by Seller from third parties; _provided_ ,
that, any costs incurred by Seller in this regard after the Closing shall be
borne by Buyer.

 

2.15 _Bulk Sales Law_. Buyer and Seller hereby waive compliance by Buyer and
Seller with the requirements and provisions of any "bulk transfer," "bulk
sales" or fraudulent transfer Laws of any jurisdiction that may otherwise be
applicable with respect to the sale of any or all of the Transferred Assets to
Buyer. Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its
affiliates from and against any claims arising out of or due to the failure to

(c) Each Seller Business Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the
Internal Revenue Service and, to the knowledge of Seller, nothing has occurred
since the date of such determination or opinion letter that would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect such plans tax qualified status.

 



-39- (d) No Business Plan provides for retiree or post-termination health or life
or death benefits, except to the extent required under COBRA or similar Law.
No tax under Code Section 4980B or Code Section 5000 has been incurred with
respect to any Business Plan that remains unsatisfied. Each Business Plan
which constitutes a "group health plan" (as defined in ERISA, the Public
Health Services Act or the Code) has been operated in compliance in all
material respects with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as
amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, and the
regulations and guidance issued thereunder ("ACA"), such that there is no
reasonable expectation that any tax or penalty could be imposed pursuant to
the ACA that relates to such group health plan.  _Section 3.8(d)_ of the
Business Disclosure Schedule lists the name of each Business Employee or
Former Business Employee and each of their qualified beneficiaries (as defined
in Section 4980B(g)(1) of the Code) who has experienced a "Qualifying Event"
(as defined in COBRA) with respect to any Business Plan for purposes of
"Continuation Coverage" (as defined in COBRA) and whose maximum period for
Continuation Coverage required by COBRA or state Law has not expired, the
nature of the Qualifying Event, and the date of the Qualifying Event and the
date that Continuation Coverage is scheduled to expire. Other than as set
forth in _Section 3.8(d)_ of the Business Disclosure Schedule,
neither Seller nor any of its affiliates has any outstanding post-termination
obligations owed to any Former Business Employee, and there are no pending, or
to the knowledge of Seller, threatened, claims by a Former Business Employee
with respect to his or her employment, termination of employment or any
employee benefits.

(e) All Business Employees have been properly classified by Seller and the
Acquired Companies for purposes of Tax reporting and Tax withholding as
required by applicable Law.

(f) Each Company Stock Option or Restricted Share that is outstanding and
that is held by a Business Employee or Former Business Employee was granted at
an exercise price per share equal to not less than 100% of the fair market
value of a share of Company Common Stock as of the grant date, determined in
a manner that complies with Sections 409A and 422 of the Code. Each Restricted
Share that is outstanding and that is held by a Business Employee or Former
Business Employee was granted pursuant to a stock option agreement permitting
early exercise and no promissory note or other agreement of indebtedness was
issued in connection with the early exercise of any such Restricted Share.

 

3.9 _Compliance with Laws_. Seller has conducted the operations of the
Business, and the Acquired Companies have conducted their businesses, in
compliance with applicable Law in all material respects. Seller and the
Acquired Companies currently have all material permits issued by a
Governmental Entity which are required for the operation of the Business as
currently conducted ((i) all of which are listed on _Section 3.9_ of the
Business Disclosure Schedule, (ii) copies of which have been previously
delivered to Buyer; and (iii) all of which are in full force and effect).
Seller and the Acquired Companies have complied and are presently in
compliance, in all material respects, with the terms and conditions of all
such permits. To the knowledge of Seller, no claim or investigation alleging
any material violation by Seller or any Acquired Company of any Law or permit
is pending or threatened. Neither Seller nor any Acquired Company has received
any written notice threatening non-renewal, suspension, expiration of, or any
noncompliance with, any material permit that remains outstanding.

(vii) enter into any Contract of the type set forth in _Section 3.12(a)_,

taking of any action of the type set forth in this clause _(c)_.

 

5.5 _Consents_. Seller shall (and shall cause the Acquired Companies to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and Buyer shall cooperate with
such efforts to obtain, prior to the Closing all consents, waivers, approvals
and notices from third Persons (other than Governmental Entities) that are

-51- 5.6 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) During the period commencing with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to its terms and the Closing, (i) Seller shall afford (and shall
cause the Acquired Companies to afford), at Buyers sole expense and subject
to applicable Law, Buyer and its Representatives reasonable access,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to the
properties, books, Business Records and personnel to the extent related to the
Business as Buyer may reasonably request (subject to any limitations that are
reasonably required to preserve any applicable attorney-client privilege,
protect any proprietary or confidential information unrelated to the Business,
or comply with third-party confidentiality obligations); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such access does not unreasonably disrupt the normal
operations of the Business or Seller; and (ii) without the prior written
consent of Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), Buyer shall not contact any employee of Seller or any Acquired
Company (other than with respect to offers of employment from Buyer to
Business Employees in accordance with the terms of this Agreement), or any
supplier or service provider to or customer of the Business in connection with
this Agreement or any of the Transactions. Any access to Sellers or any
Acquired Companys properties shall be subject to Sellers reasonable security
measures and insurance requirements and shall not include the right to perform
any "invasive" testing. Seller shall, within two (2) days following the full
execution thereof, provide Buyer with a copy of any amendment to the Merger
Agreement to the extent any such amendment is reasonably likely to impact the
timing of the closing of the Merger.

(b) Each Party shall preserve copies of all Business Records or all similar
information within such Partys possession (" _Records_ ") for at least three
(3) years after the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, each Party shall
provide any other Party and its Representatives, upon reasonable request
(subject to any limitations under Applicable Law or that are reasonably
required to protect any applicable attorney-client privilege or confidential
information), access for inspection and copying of all Records (subject to
applicable Law, including privacy laws, and any limitations that are
reasonably required to protect any applicable attorney-client privilege or
confidential information), with respect to Buyer, as is reasonably requested
by Buyer in connection with any matter relating to or arising during any
period and related to the Business, the operation thereof, or the Transferred
Assets or Assumed Liabilities, and, with respect to Seller, as is reasonably
requested by Seller in connection with any matter relating to or arising
during any period and related to Converge, the operation thereof, the
Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities, and each Party shall make such
Partys personnel reasonably available to the extent reasonably necessary to
support such requests. Additionally, each Party shall make such Partys
personnel reasonably available for interviews, depositions and testimony in
any legal matter concerning the Transactions, and solely to the extent
necessary to enable the other Party to: (i) comply with any reporting, filing
or other requirements imposed by any Governmental Entity, including filing any
Tax Returns and responding to Tax audits or Tax authority disputes with
respect to the Business, the Transferred Assets and the Transferred
Employees; (ii) assert in good faith or defend any claims or allegations in
any litigation or arbitration or in any administrative or Legal Proceeding; or
(iii) perform its obligations under this Agreement. The Party seeking such
Records shall reimburse the other Party for all reasonable and necessary out-
of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the other Party in providing such

 



-52-  information and in rendering such assistance (including providing such
personnel). The access to files, books and records contemplated by this
_Section 5.6(b)_ shall be during normal business hours and upon reasonable
prior notice and shall be subject to such reasonable limitations as the other
Party may impose to preserve the confidentiality of information contained
therein and to limit any disruption of such Partys business.

5.7 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. Subject to its right of indemnification pursuant to
_Section 7.2(a)(v)_, Buyer shall bear any and all applicable sales, filing,
recording, gross receipts, registration, duty, use, transfer, value added,
goods and services, business and occupation, excise, stamp, documentary and
other similar fees, Taxes or governmental charges that may be
imposed, assessed or payable by reason of the Transactions (together with any
interest or penalty, addition to tax or additional amount imposed) as levied
by any Taxing Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), regardless of the Person
liable for such Transfer Taxes under applicable Law. Buyer shall timely file
or cause to be filed all necessary documents (including all Tax Returns) with
respect to Transfer Taxes. The Parties shall cooperate and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any Transfer Taxes,
including by obtaining and providing to the other Party documents evidencing,
or required to obtain, an exemption from such Transfer Taxes in any
applicable jurisdiction.

(b) _Tax Returns; Straddle Period Taxes_.

 

(i) Subject to _Section 5.7(b)(ii)_ below, the Seller Stockholder
Representative will be responsible for the preparation and Seller will be
responsible for the filing of all income and other material Tax Returns of
Seller and its affiliates with respect to a taxable period ending on or before
the Closing Date (including Tax Returns required to be filed after the Closing
Date and including, for the avoidance of doubt, the final U.S. federal income
Tax Return of the consolidated group that includes the Acquired Companies for
the taxable period that will end on and include the Closing Date in accordance
with the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Code Section 1502), to the
extent such Tax Returns include or relate to Sellers use or ownership of the
Transferred Assets for such taxable period. The Seller Stockholder
Representative shall also be responsible for the preparation and Seller shall
also be responsible for the filing of all Tax Returns of the Acquired
Companies required to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date. Buyer will be
responsible for the preparation and filing of all Tax Returns it is required
to file with respect to its ownership or use of the Transferred Assets
attributable to the Post-Closing Period and all Tax Returns of the Acquired
Companies required to be filed after the Closing Date (for the avoidance
of doubt, not to include the final U.S. federal income Tax Return of the
consolidated group that includes the Acquired Companies for the taxable period
that will end on and include the Closing Date in accordance with Treasury
Regulations promulgated under Code Section 1502). With respect to any Tax
Return of an Acquired Company which is filed after the Closing Date and could
reasonably be expected to have more than a _de minimis_ negative impact upon
any of Seller or its affiliates and successors or the Seller Stockholders,
Buyer shall (i) deliver a copy of such Tax Return to the Seller and the Seller
Stockholder Representative or their successors for their review and

 



-53-  comment not less than ten (10) business days prior to the date on which such
Tax Return is due to be filed (taking into account any applicable extensions)
and (ii) make any changes reasonably requested by the Seller and the Seller
Stockholder Representative or their successors that are received by Buyer at
least five (5) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties shall not, and
shall cause their affiliates not to, amend any previously filed Tax Returns
related to the Transferred Assets or any Acquired Company for the Pre-Closing
Period or Straddle Period that would impose any additional Liabilities on the
other party without the other partys prior written consent (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) unless otherwise required
by applicable Law. Buyer shall not make any elections with respect to the
Transferred Assets or any Acquired Company for the Pre-Closing Period or
Straddle Period if such election could negatively impact the tax position of
Seller or its affiliates or the Seller Stockholders and any successors without
the Sellers and the Seller Stockholder Representatives prior written
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(ii) In the case of any property or ad valorem Taxes attributable to the
Transferred Assets or imposed upon an Acquired Company which are reported on
a Tax Return covering a Straddle Period (a " _Straddle Period Tax_ "), the
amount of the Straddle Period Taxes that shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing
Period shall be the amount of such Taxes for the relevant Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of
calendar days from the beginning of such period up to and including the
Closing Date and the denominator of which shall be the number of calendar days
in the entire period. Any other Taxes relating to the Business or the
Transferred Assets or Taxes of any Acquired Company attributable to a Straddle
Period shall be allocated based on a deemed closing of the books as of the end
of the Closing Date,  _provided_ that exemptions, allowances or deductions
that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions) other than with respect to property placed into
service after the Closing, shall be allocated on a per diem basis. The party
required by law to pay any such Straddle Period Taxes (the " _Paying Party_ ")
shall file the Tax Return related to such Straddle Period Tax within the time
period prescribed by law and shall timely pay such Straddle Period Tax. To
the extent any such payment exceeds the obligation of the Paying Party
hereunder, the Paying Party shall provide the other party (the " _Non-Paying
Party_ ") with notice of payment, and within ten (10) business days of
receipt of such notice of payment, the Non-Paying Party shall reimburse the
Paying Party for the Non-Paying Partys share of such Straddle Period Taxes.

 

(c) _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. At the request of Buyer, Seller shall join
with Buyer in making a timely election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code
(and any corresponding provisions of state, local or foreign tax law) with
respect to the purchase and sale of the stock of iControl Canada hereunder
(collectively, a " _Section 338(h)(10) Election_ "). Buyer shall determine
whether to make the Section 338(h)(10) Election and shall inform Seller and
the Seller Stockholder Representative in writing of its decision at the
Closing. In the event that the Section 338(h)(10) Election is made, then
Seller and Buyer: (A) shall report the purchase and sale of the stock of
iControl Canada hereunder consistent with such election and shall take no
position contrary thereto, and (B) shall cooperate in promptly preparing,
executing and timely filing all forms, returns, reports and other documents
required to be filed, including IRS Form 8023 (or any successor form),
relating to such election.

 



-54- 5.8 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated September 21, 2015,
between Buyer and Seller (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") are hereby
incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full force and effect
until the Closing, except, that, at which time (i) such Confidentiality
Agreement and the obligations of the Buyer under this  _Section 5.8_ shall
terminate in respect of that portion of the Proprietary Information (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) that is included within the
Transferred Assets, and, without limiting the foregoing, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue to apply to (a) the Excluded Assets,
the Excluded Liabilities and (subject to _Section 9.1_) the Transaction
Materials; and (b) the Proprietary Information provided by Seller to Buyer as
contemplated under the Confidentiality Agreement that is not part of the
Transferred Assets, and (ii) the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement
regarding the solicitation of Buyers and Sellers employees shall terminate
and the provisions set forth in _Section 5.12_ shall apply after the
Closing. The " _Transaction Materials_ " shall mean the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. If this Agreement is, for any
reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect in all respects. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, after the Closing, Sellers and
its Representatives obligations in _Section 5.8_ shall not be deemed to be
breached by any disclosure by NBCUniversal Media, LLC (" _NBCU_ ") or any
other affiliate of NBCU in the ordinary course of their business of
disseminating news and information; provided that the individuals involved in
such dissemination received such documents or information from a source other
than the personnel of Seller or its Representatives involved in the
transactions contemplated hereunder.

 

(b) From and after the Closing, the Transferred Assets (including the assets
of the Acquired Companies) shall constitute proprietary information of Buyer,
and Seller shall not use or disclose such information for any purpose, and
Seller shall hold, and shall cause its controlled affiliates and each of their
respective Representatives to hold, in confidence any and all information,
whether written or oral, concerning the Business or the Transferred Assets,
except to the extent that such information (a) concerns Technology used in the
" _Converge_ " business as of the Closing Date; (b) is generally available to
and known by the public through no fault of Seller or its affiliates or
Representatives; or (c) is lawfully acquired from and after the Closing from
sources (other than any controlled affiliate of Seller or any of Sellers or
such controlled affiliates Representatives) that are not prohibited from
disclosing such information by a legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation.
If Seller, its controlled affiliates, or any of their
respective Representatives are compelled to disclose any information by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law, Seller
shall, to the extent legally permissible, promptly notify Buyer in writing and
shall disclose only that portion of such information which Seller is advised
by its counsel in writing is legally required to be disclosed, provided, that
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an appropriate
protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded such information. Seller agrees to be responsible for any
breach of this _Section 5.8_ by any of its controlled affiliates or any of
their respective Representatives.

 



-55- 5.9 _Employees_.

 

(a) _Business Employees_.

 

(i) _Offer Letters_. At least ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer
shall have made offers of employment to all Business Employees to the extent
set forth on _Section 3.8(a)(i)_ of the Business Disclosure Schedule, which
offers of employment shall be contingent on the Closing and such Business
Employees otherwise meeting the general hiring conditions imposed by Buyer
with respect to its employees. Such offers will provide each Business Employee

3.8(a)(i)_ of the Business Disclosure Schedule and will otherwise provide
terms and conditions of employment comparable to those provided by Buyer to
similarly situated employees of Buyer and its affiliates. Effective as of the
Closing Date, Buyer will hire each such Business Employee who accepts the
offer of employment extended to such individual by Buyer and is actively
employed by Seller on such Closing Date. Each Business Employee who is not
actively employed by Seller in the United States on the Closing Date shall be
hired by Buyer on the first date that such Business Employee is eligible to
return to active service and reports to active service with Buyer; _provided_
, _however_ , that (i) such date is within ninety (90) days following the
Closing Date or, if longer, within the period required by Law to return to
active employment and (ii) any such Business Employee who is hired by Buyer
shall be treated as a Transferred Employee only with respect to the period
after such date of hire.

 

(ii) _Compensation and Benefits_. Until December 31, 2016, but subject to
_Section 5.9(b)_, Buyer shall provide each Transferred Employee who remains
in employment with Buyer or its affiliates with (A) base salary or wage rate
not less favorable than that provided in the offer letter sent pursuant to
_Section 5.9(a)(i)_ and (B) benefits that are comparable to the benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer or its affiliates.

(iii) _Service Credit_. For all employment purposes, including (i) statutory
entitlements, to the extent required by applicable Law, and (ii) eligibility
to participate, vesting and accrual of benefits under any benefit plan or
policy of Buyer in which Transferred Employees are eligible to participate
(other than a defined benefit plan), Buyer shall provide that the Transferred
Employees shall receive service credit equal to the service credit given by
Seller and its affiliates prior to the Closing;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition
would result in any duplication of benefits or coverage.

 

(iv) _COBRA_. Buyer shall provide, at its sole cost, healthcare continuation
coverage under COBRA, or similar state statute, if applicable, to Business
Employees (including Non-Transferred Employees) and their qualified
beneficiaries (as defined in Section 4980B(g)(1) of the Code) with respect to
qualifying events that occur before, on or after the Closing Date, or,
in lieu of providing such coverage directly, will reimburse Seller for the
cost of providing Business Employees with COBRA coverage under Seller plans.

 



-56- (v) _401(k) Plan_. Buyer will permit Transferred Employees who are
participants in the Seller 401(k) plan and who are employed by Buyer

(vi) _Paid-Time Off_. On or immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall

for all Business Employees. Seller shall pay, on the Closing Date, to each
Business Employee, the cash equivalent value of such unused accrued paid-time
off as of the Closing.

(b) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are
for the sole benefit of the Parties and nothing herein, expressed or implied,
is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person
(including for the avoidance of doubt any current or former employees,
directors, or independent contractors of any of Seller, Buyer or any of their
respective subsidiaries), other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or
remedies with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 5.9_.
Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and Seller shall
take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Buyer to continue any
specific employee benefit plans or to continue the employment of any specific
person. No provision in this Agreement shall modify or amend any employee
benefit plan or program. This shall not prevent the Parties entitled to
enforce this Agreement from enforcing any provision in this Agreement, but no
other party shall be entitled to enforce any provision in this Agreement on
the grounds that it is an amendment to such employee benefit plan or program.
If a party not entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other
action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to such
employee benefit plan or program and that provision is construed to be such an
amendment despite not being explicitly designated as one in this Agreement,
that provision shall lapse retroactively as of its inception, thereby
precluding it from having any amendatory effect.

 

(c) _Benefit Plans for Transferred Employees_. Without derogating from its
obligations under this _Section 5.9_, Buyer shall and shall procure that its
relevant affiliates shall, waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions, and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage

similar types of Sellers and its affiliates plans and arrangements.

 

(d) _Non-Transferred Employees_. Seller shall, or shall cause its affiliates
to, terminate the employment of all Non-Transferred Employees effective prior
to the Closing Date. As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing

the Seller 401(k) plan shall receive a distribution of their entire account
balance in accordance with the terms of the plan.

 



-57- (e) This _Section 5.9_ applies solely to the Business Employees other than
those Business Employees employed by any Acquired Company who are employed by
such Acquired Company as of the Closing Date.

(f) Following the Closing, with respect to each Overhead and Shared Services
Employee, during the period that such Overhead and Shared Services Employee is
employed by Seller and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, Seller will
use commercially reasonable efforts, at Buyers request and sole cost and
expense, to enforce any confidentiality obligations, use restrictions, non-
solicitation restrictions, and further assurances related obligations required
to perfect or register Buyers rights in Intellectual Property Rights
assigned from such Overhead and Shared Services Employee, in each case binding
on such Overhead and Shared Services Employee pursuant to agreements with
Seller if Buyer believes in good faith that such Overhead and Shared Services
Employee has breached any such obligation or restriction in any material
respect; _provided, however_ , that Seller shall not be in breach of its
obligations under this _Section 5.9(f)_ with respect to any request by Buyer
pursuant to this _Section 5.9(f)_ if Seller determines in good faith based on
the advice of legal counsel that it does not have standing to enforce such
obligations and restrictions against such Overhead and Shared Services
Employee. 

5.10 _Use of Seller s Name_.

 

(a) For so long as Seller or any of its affiliates owns the Trademarks listed
in _Section 5.10(a)_ of the Business Disclosure Schedule (the " _Seller
Trademarks_ "), subject to _Sections 2.3(a)_ and _2.3(c)_ of the Non-Patent IP
License Agreement, Buyer shall not use, and Buyer shall cause its affiliates
not to use, any Seller Trademarks or any confusingly similar marks in
connection with the sale or distribution of any products or services.

(b) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller is and shall remain the owner
of the Seller Trademarks and all goodwill attached thereto. Except pursuant to
_Sections 2.3(a)_ and _2.3(c)_ of the Non-Patent IP License Agreement, this
Agreement does not give Buyer the right to use any Seller Trademarks or any
other Trademarks of Seller other than the Transferred Trademarks. For as long
as Seller or any of its affiliates owns the rights to the Seller Trademarks,
Buyer agrees not to attempt to register the Seller Trademarks nor to register
anywhere in the world a Trademark that is the same as or, subject to _Section
2.3(c)_ of the Non-Patent IP License Agreement, confusingly similar to the
Seller Trademarks. In no event shall Buyer or any affiliate of
Buyer advertise or hold itself out as Seller or an affiliate of Seller.

5.11 _No Shop_. During the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to its terms and the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall
ensure that none of its controlled affiliates, subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives, directly or indirectly, including, without
limitation, by way of stock sale, equity or convertible debt issuance, asset
sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise (a) authorize, propose or enter into
any transaction involving any sale, lease, exclusive license or other
disposition of the

 



-58-  Business or any portion of the Transferred Assets other than the
Transactions (other than in the Ordinary Course of Business) (an "
_Acquisition Transaction_ "); (b) knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage,
knowingly solicit or initiate or engage in discussions, negotiations or
submissions of proposals or offers in respect of an Acquisition Transaction;
or (c) furnish or cause to be furnished, to any Person, any non-public
information concerning the Business or the Transferred Assets in a manner
intended to facilitate, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Transaction. Seller agrees to immediately notify Buyer if
Seller (or any of its subsidiaries or Representatives) receives any
indications of interest, requests for information or offers in respect of an
Acquisition Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
restrictions on the Seller under this  _Section 5.11_ shall in any way
prevent or inhibit Seller or any of its controlled affiliates, subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives from taking any actions in furtherance
of the Merger.

 

5.12 _Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date until the date that is twelve
(12) months after the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall not permit
any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or Representatives to, directly or
indirectly, solicit (or assist third parties in soliciting) or hire any
Transferred Employee or knowingly encourage any such solicitation, or
encourage any Transferred Employee to terminate his or her employment with
Buyer or its affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
_Section 5.12(a)_ shall prohibit Seller or any of its affiliates from a
general solicitation that is not directed specifically to any such employees
or soliciting any person whose employment has been terminated by Buyer at
least six (6) months prior to such solicitation.

 

(b) For a period beginning on the Closing Date until the date that is twelve
(12) months after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any
of its subsidiaries, affiliates or Representatives to, directly or indirectly,
solicit (or assist third parties in soliciting) or hire any person who was an
employee of Seller as of the Closing Date who was not a Business Employee and
continued as an employee of Seller after the Closing Date (a " _Seller
Employee_ ") or knowingly encourage any such solicitation, or encourage any
Seller Employee to terminate his or her employment with Seller or
its affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section
5.12(b)_ shall prohibit Buyer or any of its affiliates from (i) a general
solicitation that is not directed specifically to any such employees or
soliciting any person whose employment has been terminated by Seller at least
six (6) months prior to such solicitation; or (ii) directly or indirectly,
soliciting (or assisting third parties in soliciting) or hiring any former
employee of Seller who is an Overhead and Shared Services Employee and, if an
individual was employed in connection with the provision of services under the
Transition Services Agreement, the terms of such services under the Transition
Services Agreement has expired.

 

5.13 _Reasonable Restrictions; Severability_. Seller acknowledges that the
restrictions contained in _Sections 5.8(b)_ and  _5.12_ are reasonable and
necessary to protect the goodwill of the Business and the Transferred Assets
and the legitimate interests of Buyer and constitute a material inducement to
Buyer to enter into this 

 



-59-  Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The covenants
in _Sections 5.8(b)_ and _5.12_ are severable and separate, and the
unenforceability of any specific covenant in _Sections 5.8(b)_ or _5.12_ is
not intended by either party to, and shall not, affect the provisions of any
other covenant in _Sections 5.8(b)_ or _5.12_. If any court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that the scope or time restrictions set forth in
_Sections 5.8(b)_ or _5.12_ are unreasonable as applied to Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries, the parties acknowledge their mutual intention and agreement
that those restrictions be enforced to the fullest extent the court deems
reasonable, and thereby shall be reformed to that extent.

5.14  _Communications Plan_. Seller and Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to agree on a communication plan, which communication plan
shall be subject to the review and approval of Converge Buyer (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to notify
customers, distributors/resellers or suppliers (as appropriate) of the sale of
the Business to Buyer and to execute such plan.

 

5.15 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the period commencing with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms and the Closing, Seller
shall give notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall give notice to Seller, as promptly
as reasonably practicable upon becoming aware of (a) any fact, change,
condition, circumstance, event, occurrence or non-occurrence that has caused
or is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty in this
Agreement made by it to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect; or
(b) any material failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, in
each case if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure
would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the
obligations of Seller or Buyer, as applicable, to consummate the Transactions
set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_ (in the case of Buyer) and
_Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ (in the case of Seller) to fail to be
satisfied at the Closing. In addition, Seller shall give Buyer notice, as
promptly as reasonably practicable upon becoming aware, of any Legal
Proceedings initiated by, against, or involving Seller or any Acquired
Company. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.15 shall not
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party
receiving such notice, or the representations or warranties of, or the
conditions to the obligations of, the Parties. Any Partys unintentional
failure to give notice under this _Section 5.15_ shall not be deemed to be a
breach of covenant under this _Section 5.15_ but instead shall constitute
only a breach of the underlying representation, warranty, covenant, condition
or agreement, as the case may be.

5.16  _Administration of Accounts_.

(a) From and after the Closing, all payments and reimbursements by any third
party in the name of or to Buyer to the extent, in connection with, arising
out of or relating to the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities that are
received by Buyer after the Closing shall be

 



-60-  held by Buyer in trust for the benefit of Seller and, promptly upon receipt
by Buyer of any such payment or reimbursement, Buyer shall pay over to Seller
the amount of such payment or reimbursement without right of set-off.

(b) From and after the Closing, all payments and reimbursements made by any
third party in the name of or to Seller to the extent, in connection with,
arising out of or relating to the Transferred Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities that are received by Seller after the Closing shall be held by
Seller in trust for the benefit of Buyer and, promptly upon receipt by Seller
of any such payment or reimbursement, Seller shall pay over to Buyer the
amount of such payment or reimbursement without right of set-off.

 

5.17 _Mail Received After the Closing_. Following the Closing, Buyer shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller all mail received by it or the
Business after the Closing that pursuant to this Agreement belongs to Seller
or any of its affiliates. Following the Closing, Seller shall deliver or cause

the Closing that pursuant to this Agreement belongs to Buyer.

5.18 _Support Agreements_. Prior to Closing, Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain executed Support Agreements in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit J_ from the stockholders of Seller (the "
_Support Agreements_ ").

 

5.19 _Treatment of Company Options and Restricted Shares_.

 

(a) At the Closing Date, to the extent permissible under applicable law, each
Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) that is outstanding and unvested as
of immediately prior to the Closing Date and that is held by a Transferred
Employee, shall, subject to action on the part of Seller and the holder of
such Company Stock Option as described below in this _Section 5.19_,
be assumed or substituted by Guarantor upon and subject to the terms of this
Agreement (each, an " _Assumed Option_ "). Except as provided herein, each
Assumed Option shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as
applied to the related Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Closing
Date, including the vesting schedule, except that (A) the number of shares of
Guarantor common stock subject to each Assumed Option shall be equal to the
product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such
Assumed Option as of immediately prior to the Closing Date multiplied by (y)
the Option Exchange Ratio (with the resulting number rounded down to the
nearest whole share), and (B) the per share exercise price of each Assumed
Option shall be equal to the quotient determined by dividing (x) the exercise
price per share at which such Assumed Option was exercisable immediately prior
to the Closing Date by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio (with the resulting
price per share rounded up to the nearest cent). It is the intent of the
parties hereto that, to the extent reasonably practicable and permitted by
applicable law, the assumption or substitution of Assumed Options will be
effected in a manner that is intended to satisfy Section

 



-61-  409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and,
with respect to options classified as "incentive stock options," in a manner
that is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder; provided, however, that the
parties understand and acknowledge that Assumed Options relating to Company
Stock Options that, prior to the Closing Date were intended to qualify as
"incentive stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code and
Treasury Regulations thereunder may not so qualify. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this _Section 5.19(a)_, each Company Stock Option (i) held by
a Person other than a Transferred Employee, (ii) held by a Transferred
Employee employed outside the U.S. (including, but not limited to, Company
Stock Options held by Business Employees employed by any Acquired Company),
or (iii) that is vested as of immediately prior to the Closing Date shall not
be assumed or otherwise substituted by Guarantor and shall in no event become
Assumed Options.

 

(b) At the Closing Date, each Company Stock Option (or portion thereof) that
is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Closing Date and
is held by a Transferred Employee employed outside the U.S. shall be cancelled
(each, a " _Cancelled Option_ ") and each such Transferred Employee shall be
entitled to receive, in full satisfaction and payment of such Transferred
Employees rights with respect to such Cancelled Option an amount of cash
determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Cancelled Option immediately prior to the Closing Date, by
(y) the Company Common Stock Value less the per share exercise price of the
option (the " _Cancelled Option Consideration_ "). The Cancelled Option
Consideration will be subject to the same vesting restrictions and continued
service requirements applicable to the unvested Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Closing Date, except for administrative changes that
are not materially adverse to the holder of such Cancelled Option or to which
the holder consents. Payment of the Cancelled Option Consideration in respect
to the Cancelled Option shall be made, subject to such terms and conditions,
on the vesting dates applicable to the unvested Company Stock Option, less
applicable tax withholding.

(c) At the Closing Date, each Restricted Share granted as an early exercise
Company Stock Option under any Company Stock Plan that is outstanding and
unvested as of immediately prior to the Closing Date and is held by a
Transferred Employee shall, subject to action on the part of Seller and the
holder of such Restricted Share as described below in this  _Section 5.19_,
be assumed or substituted by Guarantor upon and subject to the terms of this
Agreement (each, an " _Assumed Restricted Share_ "). Except as provided
herein, each Assumed Restricted Share shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions as applied to the related Restricted Share immediately prior to the
Closing Date, including the vesting schedule. The number of shares of
Guarantor common stock subject to such Assumed Restricted Share shall be
equal to the product of the (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
underlying such Assumed Restricted Share as of immediately prior to the
Closing Date multiplied by (y) the Option Exchange Ratio (with the
resulting number rounded down to the nearest whole share). Notwithstanding
the provisions of this Section 5.19(c), each Restricted Share (i) held by a
Person other than a Transferred Employee, (ii) held by a Transferred Employee
employed outside the U.S. (including, but not limited to, Restricted Shares
held by Business Employees employed by any Acquired Company), or (iii) that is
vested as of immediately prior to the Closing Date shall not be assumed or
otherwise substituted by Guarantor and shall in no event become Assumed
Restricted Shares.

 



-62- (d) At the Closing Date, each Restricted Share that is outstanding and
unvested as of immediately prior to the Closing Date and is held by a
Transferred Employee employed outside the U.S. shall be cancelled (each, a
"Cancelled Restricted Share") and each such Transferred Employee shall be
entitled to receive, in full satisfaction and payment of such Transferred
Employees rights with respect to such Cancelled Restricted Share an amount of
cash determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Cancelled Restricted Share immediately prior to the
Closing Date, by (y) the Company Common Stock Value (the "Cancelled Restricted
Share Consideration"). The Cancelled Restricted Share Consideration will be
subject to the same vesting restrictions and continued service requirements
applicable to the unvested Restricted Shares immediately prior to the Closing
Date, except for administrative changes that are not materially adverse to the
holder of such Cancelled Restricted Share or to which the holder consents.
Payment of the Cancelled Restricted Share Consideration in respect to the
Cancelled Restricted Share shall be made, subject to such terms and
conditions, on the vesting dates applicable to the unvested Restricted Share,
less applicable tax withholding.

(e) To the extent necessary, as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing Date Guarantor will file a Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) with
respect to the shares of Guarantor common stock issuable with respect to the
Assumed Options and Assumed Restricted Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 5.19_, prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
take or cause to be taken all action, shall obtain consents and the release of
claims of each affected Transferred Employee with respect to any assumption or
substitution, or any cancellation and payment, by Guarantor under this
_Section 5.19_ and shall provide all notices, as may be required, whether
under the Company Stock Plans or otherwise, reasonably necessary or requested
by Buyer or Guarantor to effect the treatment of Company Stock Options and
Restricted Shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 5.19_.

5.20 _Transition Services Agreement_. Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to finalize with the Converge Buyer, as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date of this Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement to be
executed by the Buyer and Seller at Closing.

SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

 

7.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_. If
the Transactions are consummated, all of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) subject to clause (b), the
representations and warranties of Buyer and Seller set forth in this
Agreement shall survive through and until 11:59 p.m. (California time) on the
date that is the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date; and (b)
Sellers representations and warranties contained in  _Section 3.1(a)_,
_Section 3.1(b)_, _Section 3.2_, the first two sentences of _Section
3.4(a)_, _Section 3.7_, and _Section 3.16_ (the " _Fundamental
Representations_ ") and the representations and warranties of Buyer set forth
in _Section 4.1_, _Section 4.2_, _Section 4.4_, and _Section 4.8_ (the "
_Buyer Fundamental Representations_ ") shall survive until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations. The survival periods set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence are referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Survival Periods_." In the event that an Indemnified Party shall deliver a
Claim Certificate to an Indemnifying Party setting forth facts evidencing that
a claim for indemnification under this _Article VII_ may be made in respect
of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Indemnifying Party set forth in this Agreement prior to the expiration of the
applicable Survival Period, then such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement shall continue in full force and effect solely with respect to such
claim until the final resolution thereof. It is the express

 



-65-  intent of the Parties that, if the applicable survival period for an item
contemplated by this _Section 7.1_ is shorter than the statute of limitations
that would otherwise have been applicable to such item, then, by contract,
the applicable statute of limitations with respect to such item will be
reduced to the shortened survival period contemplated herein. The covenants
contained in this Agreement that by their terms are to be performed after the
Closing shall survive Closing according to their terms.

7.2 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations and procedures set forth in this _Article
VII_, from and after the Closing, the Seller Stockholders shall indemnify and
hold harmless Buyer and its affiliates, and each of their respective

against any and all damages, losses, Liabilities, costs or other expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and costs of investigation)
(collectively, " _Losses_ ") paid or incurred by such Buyer Indemnified Party
(as paid or incurred) as a result of or arising from:

(i) any breach or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Seller set
forth in this Agreement (as qualified by the Business Disclosure Schedule) or
in the Seller Certificate;

(ii) any breach by Seller of any of its covenants or other agreements set
forth in this Agreement which by their terms require performance on or prior
to the Closing;

(iii) any Assumed Liabilities not reflected as a deduction in the calculation
of Closing Working Capital (other than Assumed Liabilities relating to Taxes,
which shall be governed by _Section 7.2(a)(iv)_ and _7.2(a)(v)_ ) set forth
in _Sections 2.4(a)_ , _2.4(b)_ or  _2.4(c)_ , solely to the extent that such
Liabilities relate to the conduct of the Business prior to the Closing, and
any Assumed Liabilities set forth in _Section 2.4(d)_ or _Section 2.4(e)_;

 

(iv) any Assumed Liabilities not reflected as a deduction in the calculation
of Closing Working Capital relating to Taxes that: (x) arise with respect to
a Pre-Closing Period (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the portion of
such Taxes that are Straddle Period Taxes allocated to the Pre-Closing Period
pursuant to _Section 5.7(b)(ii)_), and (y) are not Transfer Taxes; or

(v) one-half (50%) of all Assumed Liabilities not reflected as a deduction in
the calculation of Closing Working Capital relating to Transfer Taxes.

(b) Subject to the limitations and procedures set forth in this _Article
VII_, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless
Seller, the Seller Stockholders and their respective affiliates and each of
their Representatives (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ "),

Indemnified Parties (as paid or incurred) as a result of or arising from:

 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy by Buyer of any representation or warranty of
Buyer set forth in this Agreement or in the Buyer Certificate; 

 



-66- (ii) any breach by Buyer of any of its covenants or other agreements set forth
in this Agreement, whether to be performed before or after the Closing;

(iii) with respect to Seller, any Assumed Liabilities;

 

(iv) with respect to the Seller Stockholders, any Assumed Liabilities other
than those described in _Section 7.2(a)(iii)_,  _7.2(a)(iv)_ or _7.2(a)(v)_
; or

(v) with respect to Seller, Sellers performance of its obligations pursuant
to  _Section 5.9(f)_ or Sellers compliance with any request of Buyer
thereunder.

(c) Subject to the limitations and procedures set forth in this _Article
VII_, from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Losses paid or incurred
by such Buyer Indemnified Party (as paid or incurred) as a result of or
arising from:

(i) any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities; or

 

(ii) any breach by Seller of any of its covenants or other agreements set
forth in this Agreement which by their terms require performance after the
Closing.

(d) Prior to and after Closing, the remedies specified in this _Article VII_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of any Indemnified Party with regard
to any Losses arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including with
respect to any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities) and the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that except for matters
expressly covered by representations, warranties or covenants in the body of
this Agreement, the remedies for any Losses arising out of the License
Agreements or the Transition Services Agreement shall be governed by the
provisions set forth in the License Agreements or the Transition Services
Agreement, as applicable, and shall not be recoverable by any Party pursuant
to this _Article VII_, and nothing in this Agreement shall limit any Partys
rights to indemnification or remedies provided in the License Agreements or
the Transition Services Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit (including the
limitations set forth in _Section 7.3_) (i) any Partys remedies with
respect to claims based on fraud (except with respect to Seller as to fraud
related to any actions or omissions prior to the Closing as released pursuant
to  _Section 7.2(e)_), or (ii) any Partys right to seek specific
performance or the issuance of immediate injunctive and other equitable
relief, including a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or
other interim or conservatory relief, pursuant to _Section 10.12_ to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof (including, for avoidance of doubt, _Section 5.8(b)_, _Section 5.11_,
and  _5.12_ , and the payment obligations of Buyer pursuant to _Section 2.1_
or _2.8_ ). For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of _Section
7.2(a)(iii)_, _7.2(a)(iv)_ and _7.2(a)(v)_ , "Losses" shall include all
Losses paid or incurred by Buyer as a result of its obligation to indemnify
Seller or its affiliates pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)(iii)_.

 

(e) Without limitation of the foregoing, effective as of the Closing, Buyer,
for itself, its agents, affiliates and past, present or future successors and
assigns, irrevocably, unconditionally and completely fully and forever
releases, acquits and forever discharges Seller and

 



-67-  its affiliates (except to the extent such affiliates are a Seller
Stockholder providing indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_) and
Representatives from any actions, Liabilities, Encumbrances, disputes,
counterclaims, controversies, damages, rights, obligations, and executions of
every description, kind and nature past, present or future at law, in equity
or otherwise whether liquidated or unliquidated, matured or
unmatured, absolute or contingent, in each case solely to the extent
consisting of: (i) the Assumed Liabilities, (ii) the matters indemnified by
the Seller Stockholders pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ or (iii) any fraud or
Willful Breach of Seller (as related to any actions or omissions prior to the
Closing) in connection with this Agreement. The release in this _Section
7.2(e)_ shall not affect or impair the rights of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
under  _Section 7.2(a)_.

7.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under
_Section 7.2(a)(i)_, and the Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled
to indemnification under _Section 7.2(b)(i)_, for any Indemnification Claims
made after the expiration of the applicable Survival Period. Buyer
Indemnified Parties may only make Indemnification Claims under _Section
7.2(a)(i)_, and Seller Indemnified Parties may only make Indemnification
Claims under _Section 7.2(b)(i)_, prior to the expiration of the applicable

periods with respect to the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the other Party contained in this Agreement.

Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under

pursuant to this Article VII if the amount of such individual Loss is less
than Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (the " _Single Claim Threshold_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_
unless and until Buyer shall have paid or incurred Losses in respect of which
the Buyer Indemnified Parties are otherwise entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article VII_ that exceed $1,400,000 (the " _Basket_ ") in
the aggregate, whereupon the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to indemnification under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ for otherwise recoverable
Losses including the amount of the Basket; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, Losses from a single set of (or series of
related) facts and circumstances that do not exceed the Single Claim
Threshold shall not be applied toward the Basket or be recoverable under this
_Article VII_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
no event shall the cumulative amount of Losses for which the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification under _Section
7.2(a)(i)_, _7.2(a)(ii)_ (other than for a Willful Breach),

 



-68-   _7.2(a)(iii)_ , _7.2(a)(iv)_ or _7.2(a)(v)_ in the aggregate exceed the
amounts initially available in the General Escrow Fund (the " _Cap_ "), which
General Escrow Fund will be the sole source of recovery therefor; _provided_
, _however_ , that the cumulative amount of Losses for which the Buyer

other Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties have otherwise received
indemnification under _Section 7.2(a)_; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
none of the limitations set forth in this _Article VII_, including _Section
7.3(b)_,  _Section 7.3(c)_ and this _Section 7.3(d)_, but excluding
_Section 7.3(g)_, _Section 7.3(i)_ and _Section 7.3(j)_, shall apply to any

proviso) or fraud.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under
_Section 7.2(b)(i)_ unless and until the Seller Indemnified Parties shall
have paid or incurred Losses in respect of which the Seller Indemnified
Parties are otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Article
VII_ that exceed the Basket in the aggregate, whereupon the Seller Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to indemnification under _Section 7.2(b)(i)_ for
all Losses, including the amount of the Basket; _provided_ , _however_ , that

VII_, and (ii) in no event shall the cumulative amount of Losses for which the
Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification under _Section
7.2(b)(i)_,  _Section 7.2(b)(ii)_ (unless such breach was a Willful Breach)
(without limiting in any way recovery by the Seller Indemnified Parties for
Losses arising under or in connection with any amounts payable to Seller
pursuant to  _Section 2.1_ or _2.8_ ), exceed, in the aggregate, an amount
equal to the Cap; _provided_ , _however_ , that the cumulative amount of
Losses for which the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification under  _Section 7.2(b)(i)_ for any breach by Buyer of the
Buyer Fundamental Representations or _Section 7.2(b)(ii)_ (if such breach was
a Willful Breach) may exceed an amount equal to the Cap but shall not exceed
an amount equal to the Purchase Price; _provided_ , _further_ , that (i) none
of the limitations set forth in this _Article VII_, including _Section
7.3(b)_ and this _Section 7.3(e)_, shall apply to any fraud.

and after the Closing:

 

(i) the amount of Losses for which indemnification is available under this
Agreement (including this _Article VII_) arising out of a single set of (or
series of related) facts and circumstances shall be reduced by the amount of
any funds actually received by the Indemnified Parties from any Person other
than the Indemnifying Party for such specific facts or
circumstances, including any third party insurance recoveries received from
third party insurers and amounts received from any third party indemnitor
(including, with respect to any indemnity under _Section 7.2(a)_, any
indemnification available under  _Section 7.2(c)_), for avoidance of doubt,
net of any costs incurred to obtain such proceeds or indemnification amounts
(or premium adjustments as a result thereof);

 



-69- (ii) the Losses for which indemnification is available under this Agreement
(including this  _Article VII_) shall not include, and no Indemnified Party
may bring or recover any indemnification claims based on any multiple of any
financial or business measure (including earnings, revenues, sales or other
benchmarks), or any punitive damages (except to the extent actually awarded
to a third party).

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
the event that a single set (or series of related) facts and circumstances
entitles the Indemnified Parties to indemnification under more than one
section or subsection of _Section 7.2(a)_ and _7.2(c)_ , any Loss for which
the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_Article VII_ shall be recoverable only once with respect to that set of
facts and circumstances giving rise to such Loss, regardless of whether such
facts and circumstances constitute an inaccuracy in or breach of more than
one representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
no event shall the cumulative amount of Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to indemnification under _Section 7.2(a)_ exceed,
in the aggregate, the Purchase Price less the amount of other Losses for
which the Buyer Indemnified Parties have otherwise received indemnification
under this Agreement, and the General Escrow Fund shall be the first source of
recovery therefor.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, to
the extent Losses are recoverable under this _Article VII_  from the General
Escrow Fund, the indemnification obligations of the Seller Stockholders shall
be joint and several, and to the extent Losses are recoverable under this
_Article VII_ in excess of the General Escrow Amount, the
indemnification obligations of the Seller Stockholders shall be on a Pro Rata
Basis, severally and not jointly. Except for Losses recoverable from the
General Escrow Fund, no Seller Stockholder shall be required to indemnify any
Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ in excess of (i) the
portion of the Purchase Price actually received by such Seller Stockholder on
an after-tax basis (as distributed to the Seller Stockholders pursuant to the
Merger Agreement) in the aggregate for all Losses, and (ii) such Seller
Stockholders Pro Rata Basis of any such Loss. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, except for Losses recoverable from the
General Escrow Fund, in no event will any Seller Stockholder be required to
indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Parties under this Agreement for the fraud of
any other party.

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to make any claim for recovery for
any Loss related to or arising from (i) the amount or availability of any Tax
asset or attribute of an Acquired Company, or (ii) the ability of any Buyer
Indemnified Party to utilize any Tax asset or attribute of any Acquired
Company following the Closing.

 

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
neither the Escrow Fund nor the Seller Stockholders shall be a source of
recovery for any Buyer Indemnified Parties for any claims pursuant to _Section
7.2(c)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Seller Stockholder is also an
affiliate of Seller post-Closing, this _Section 7.3(k)_ shall only be a
limitation with respect to claims against the Seller Stockholder in its
capacity as a stockholder of Seller and not in its capacity as an affiliate of
Seller.

 



-70- (l) For purposes of this _Article VII_ , the amount of any Loss related to any
breach of a representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to
any "material," "Material Adverse Effect" or similar qualifiers set forth
therein, but not the occurrence of breach itself.

 

(m) Nothing in this Agreement shall eliminate the duty, if any exists under
applicable Law, of any Indemnified Party to mitigate the amount of any Losses
indemnifiable under this _Article VII_.

(n) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
Seller Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification under _Section
7.2(b)(iii)_ for any Losses related to Assumed Liabilities to the extent such
Losses were reflected as a reduction to Closing Net Assets (as such term is
defined in the Merger Agreement).

7.4 _Indemnification Claims_.

 

(a) If an Indemnified Party determines that it may have a right to
indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnification Claim_ "),
including with respect to a Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Party shall so
notify the Indemnifying Party in a written notice (a " _Claim Certificate_ ")
promptly after such determination, and prior to the expiration of any
applicable Survival Period (if applicable), stating that the Indemnified Party
has directly paid or incurred Losses for which it is claiming indemnification
under this Agreement, or that it reasonably expects to incur such Losses,
describing the claim in reasonable detail, including (to the extent known) the
facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the claim, the nature of the
misrepresentation, default, breach of warranty or breach of covenant to which
the claim is related, and indicating the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of each item of Loss. The failure to deliver such Claim
Certificate promptly shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by reason of such failure, or
except if a Claim Certificate describing an item of Loss is not delivered to
the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this  _Section 7.4(a)_ prior to
the expiration of the Survival Period applicable to such item, in which case
the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to recovery with respect to such
item.

 

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall seek to contest any
individual items of Losses set forth in a Claim Certificate, the Indemnifying
Party shall so notify the Indemnified Party in writing within thirty (30) days
after delivery to the Indemnifying Party of such Claim Certificate, which
notice shall set forth a description in reasonable detail of the
Indemnifying Partys basis for objecting to each item of Loss (the "
_Objection Notice_ "). In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall fail to
object to one or more items of Loss set forth in a Claim Certificate within
the foregoing thirty (30) day period, and such Claim Certificate has been
delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable Survival Period (if
applicable), the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have irrevocably agreed
and consented to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of

 



-71-  such items of Loss pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. No Indemnified
Party shall have any right to indemnification under this _Article VII_ with
respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement of an Indemnifying Party unless a Claim Certificate with respect to
the resulting Losses is delivered to the Indemnifying Party prior to the
expiration of the applicable Survival Period.

 

(c) In the event that the Indemnified Party shall fail to dispute any
objections to an item of Loss contested in an Objection Notice in writing and
in accordance with _Section 10.13(b)_ within thirty (30) days after delivery
to the Indemnified Party of the Objection Notice, the Indemnified Party shall
be deemed to have irrevocably agreed and consented to the position of the
Indemnifying Party set forth in the Objection Notice in respect of such item
of Loss pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

7.5  _Third Party Claims_.

(a) In the event that any Indemnified Party receives a claim or demand from a
third party for which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to
indemnification from an Indemnifying Party pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article VII_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the
receipt of such claim or demand, notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of
such Third Party Claim (" _Notice of Third Party Claim_ "). The failure to
give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that
the defense of such Third Party Claim is materially prejudiced by reason of
such failure.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to control and assume the
defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim and any litigation resulting
therefrom with counsel reasonably acceptable to Indemnified Party and at
Indemnifying Partys sole cost and expense (a " _Third Party Defense_ ") by
delivering notice thereof to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days
from the date on which the Indemnified Party delivers the Notice of Third
Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any Third Party
Claim that (i) seeks equitable relief, or (ii) in which exists a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that cannot
be waived, such Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to
direct settlement discussions with regards to such Third Party Claim and
otherwise control the defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_further_ , however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into or
any judgment that was consented to without the Indemnifying Partys prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned); _provided_ , _further_ , however, that if the Indemnifying Party
exercises its right to control and assume the Third Party Defense in
accordance with this _Section 7.5(b)_, it shall (i) at all times have the
right to control and direct any Legal Proceeding arising from such Third Party
Claim, including, without limitation, any motions, responses, pleadings, or
arguments in connection with any such Legal Proceeding and (ii) be deemed to
have agreed to be liable to the Indemnified Party for Losses arising from such
Third Party Claim, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article
VII_. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the Third Party Defense in accordance
herewith, (1) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its
sole 

 



-72-  cost and expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim,
but the Indemnifying Party shall control the investigation, defense and
settlement thereof; _provided, however_ , that the fees and expenses of the
Indemnified Partys counsel that are incurred prior to the Indemnifying
Partys effective assumption of the Third Party Claim shall be the
responsibility of the Indemnifying Party; and (2) the Indemnified Party shall
not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), and (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, unless, with respect to this clause (iii) (A) the judgment or
settlement provides solely for the payment of money and no admission of fault;
(B) the Indemnifying Party makes such payment in full; and (C) the applicable
Indemnified Parties receive an unconditional full and final release related to
such Third Party Claim. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party has assumed the
Third Party Defense, the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to
indemnify such Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into,
or any judgment relating to a Third Party Claim that was consented to by such
Indemnified Party without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (x) to the extent
that any Third Party Claim challenges the validity or enforceability of, or
any of Sellers or its affiliates rights with respect to, Intellectual
Property Rights owned by Seller or any of its affiliates, as among the
Parties, Seller shall be entitled to control the defense of such Third Party
Claim, including any settlement thereof, (y) to the extent that any Third
Party Claim challenges the validity or enforceability of, or any of Buyers or
its affiliates rights with respect to, any Transferred Intellectual Property
Rights, as among the Parties, Buyer shall be entitled to control the defense
of such Third Party Claim, including any settlement thereof and (z) nothing in
this Agreement shall be construed as granting any Seller Stockholder any right
to assert or enforce any Intellectual Property Rights of Seller or Buyer or
any of their respective affiliates, whether in connection with any Third Party
Claim or otherwise, and such rights to assert and enforce such Intellectual
Property Rights shall be held exclusively by Seller and Buyer, as applicable.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the Third Party Defense within
thirty (30) days of delivery by the Indemnified Party of the Notice of Third
Party Claim, (i) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume the Third
Party Defense upon delivery of notice to such effect to the Indemnifying
Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to participate in the Third Party Defense at its sole cost and expense,
but the Indemnified Party shall control the investigation, defense and
settlement thereof; and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement entered into or
any judgment that was consented to without the Indemnifying Partys prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned).

(d) The Parties (including Seller with respect to claims under _Section
7.2(a)_) shall cooperate with each other in all aspects of any investigation,
defense, pretrial activities, trial, compromise, settlement or discharge of
any claim in respect of which an Indemnified Party is seeking indemnification
pursuant to this _Article VII_, including by providing the other Party with
reasonable access to books, records, employees and officers (including as
witnesses) of the Business (subject to any limitations that are reasonably
required to preserve any applicable attorney-client privilege, protect any
proprietary or confidential information unrelated to the Business or the Third
Party Claim, or comply with third-party confidentiality obligations).

 



-73- 7.6 _No Additional Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the Parties hereto agree and acknowledge that any
Indemnified Party may bring a claim for indemnification for any Loss under
this _Article VII_ notwithstanding the fact that such Indemnified Party had
knowledge of the breach, event or circumstance giving rise to such Loss prior
to the Closing or waived any condition to the Closing related thereto.

7.7 _Tax Treatment_. Any indemnity payment under this _Article VII_ shall be
treated by the Parties for Tax purposes as a Purchase Price adjustment unless
otherwise required by applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, any
indemnity payment made pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_ shall be treated as made
by the Seller Stockholders on behalf of Seller for purposes of this _Section
7.7_, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

7.8 _Joint Written Instructions_. As promptly as practicable, and in any event
no later than five (5) business days, following the resolution of any claim
for indemnification for any Loss under this _Article VII_ , the Parties shall
provide joint instructions to the Escrow Agent, in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement, to transfer to the applicable Indemnified Parties, the portion of
the General Escrow Fund required to satisfy such claim.

7.9 _Seller Stockholder Representative_. With respect to procedural matters
only, such as notices, communications and other actions required under this
_Article VII_ involving the Seller Stockholders as the "Indemnifying Party"
for claims under _Section 7.2(a)_, the Seller Stockholder Representative
shall administer, manage, control or conduct such procedural matters pursuant
to the authority granted to the Seller Stockholder Representative under
_Article IX_ and references to the "Indemnifying Party" shall be deemed to
refer to the Seller Stockholder Representative for such purposes (and not with
respect to liability for Losses) under this _Article VII_. Any decision, act,
consent or instruction of the Seller Stockholder Representative shall
constitute a decision of all of the Seller Stockholders and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon each of such Seller Stockholders, and Buyer may
rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Seller
Stockholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction
of each and every Seller Stockholder. Buyer is hereby relieved from any
Liability to any Person for any acts done by Buyer in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Seller Stockholder
Representative.

_Section 12.01(b)(i)_ of the Merger Agreement, the Termination Date shall be

Party (except for any liability of any Party for any breaches of this
Agreement prior to such termination). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the provisions of this _Section 8.2_, _Article X_ and the Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and shall have no other duty, express
or implied. The Seller Stockholder Representative is not, nor shall the Seller
Stockholder Representative be deemed, a fiduciary of the Seller Stockholders
in any capacity or for any purpose.

 



-77- 9.2 _Authorization; Reliance_. By virtue of their execution of a Support
Agreement or approval of the Merger and this Agreement, each of the Seller
Stockholders shall be deemed to have appointed Fortis Advisors LLC as the
Seller Stockholder Representative. Fortis Advisors LLC hereby agrees to act as
the Seller Stockholder Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
and an engagement agreement entered into on or before the Closing by and among
Seller, the Seller Stockholder Representative and certain Seller Stockholders.
The Seller Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to (i) rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any statements furnished to it by
any Seller Stockholder, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to be
genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper
authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Seller Stockholder or other
party.

9.3 _No Liability_. Certain Seller Stockholders have entered into an
engagement agreement with the Seller Stockholder Representative to provide
direction to the Seller Stockholder Representative in connection with its
services under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (such Seller
Stockholders, including their individual representatives, collectively
hereinafter referred to as the " _Advisory Group_ "). Neither the Seller
Stockholder Representative nor its members, managers, directors, officers,
contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory Group
(collectively, the " _Seller Stockholder Representative Group_ "), shall have
any responsibility or liability for any representation, warranty or covenant
of Seller; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, nothing herein shall affect the responsibilities or
liabilities of any member of the Seller Stockholder Representative Group in
their capacities as Seller Stockholders. The Seller Stockholder Representative
Group shall not be liable for any act done or omitted to be done as Seller
Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith and in the exercise of
reasonable judgment in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Seller Stockholder Representatives responsibilities hereunder, under the
Escrow Agreement or under any Seller Stockholder Representative
engagement agreement. The Seller Stockholder Representative Group shall, in
no case or event, be liable to any Seller Stockholder for any punitive,
incidental or consequential damages. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Seller Stockholder Representative Group shall not be liable
for forgeries or false impersonations by any other person. The Seller
Stockholders shall indemnify and defend the Seller Stockholder Representative
and hold it harmless against any loss, liability, claim, damages, fee, cost,
judgment, fine, amount paid in settlement or expense incurred without fraud,
gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of such Seller
Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder, including expenses
of any legal counsel or other skilled professionals retained by the Seller
Stockholder Representative and costs incurred in connection with seeking
recovery from insurers (" _Seller Stockholder Representative Losses_ "). The
Seller Stockholder Representative shall have the right to recover any Seller
Stockholder Representative Losses from the Seller Stockholder Representative
Fund as such expenses arise and, to the extent that the Seller Stockholder
Representative Fund has been depleted, if then available after satisfaction of
all claims of Buyer Indemnified Parties, the Seller Stockholder Representative
shall have the right to recover Seller Stockholder Representative Losses from
the General Escrow Fund prior to the final distribution to the Seller
Stockholders. In the event that the Seller Stockholder Representative Fund is
exhausted and the General Escrow Fund is unavailable, the Seller Stockholders
shall be responsible for (i) the payment of all fees and expenses reasonably
incurred by the Seller Stockholder Representative in performing its duties
under this Agreement, and 

 



-78-  (ii) any Seller Stockholder Representative Losses (together, (i) and (ii)
above are " _Excess Fees and Losses_ "); and each Seller Stockholder shall
promptly deliver to the Seller Stockholder Representative full payment of
his, her or its pro rata portion of such Excess Fees and Losses. The Seller
Stockholders acknowledge that the Seller Stockholder Representative shall not
be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties
or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the Seller
Stockholder Representative shall not be required to take any action unless the
Seller Stockholder Representative has been provided with funds which, in its
determination, are sufficient to protect the Seller
Stockholder Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which
may be incurred by the Seller Stockholder Representative in performing such
actions. This _Section 9.3_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 

9.4 _Seller Stockholder Representative Fund_. Any out-of-pocket costs and
expenses reasonably incurred by the Seller Stockholder Representative in
connection with actions taken by the Seller Stockholder Representative
pursuant to the terms of this _Section 9.4_ (including the hiring of legal
counsel and the incurring of reasonable legal fees and costs) and any Seller
Stockholder Representative Losses will be paid to the Seller Stockholder
Representative from the Seller Stockholder Representative Fund, and the Seller
Stockholder Representative may use the Seller Stockholder Representative Fund
only (i) only to pay such costs and expenses reasonably incurred and to
satisfy any Seller Stockholder Representative Losses, (ii) as otherwise
directed by the Advisory Group, or (iii) as contemplated by the Merger
Agreement.

 

9.5 _Access to Information_. The Seller Stockholder Representative shall have
the same access to information about the Business and the Transferred Assets
and the reasonable assistance of Buyers officers, directors and employees as
Seller for purposes of performing its duties and exercising its rights
hereunder, provided that, any information received by the Seller Stockholder
Representative in performing its duties and exercising rights hereunder shall
constitute confidential information of Buyer and the Seller Stockholder
Representative hereby agrees to be bound by _Section 5.8(b)_ with respect
to any such information as if it were Seller. In furtherance of the
foregoing, after the Closing Date, Buyer will grant access to its premises in
Redwood City, California, to a reasonable number of individuals (subject to
any limitations under applicable Law or that are reasonably required to
protect any applicable attorney-client privilege or confidential information)
as is reasonably requested by the Seller Stockholder Representative to the
extent necessary to perform its obligations under this Agreement and the
Merger Agreement. Such access shall be during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice and shall be subject to such reasonable limitations as
Buyer may impose to preserve the confidentiality of information contained
therein and to limit any disruption of Buyers business.

 



-79- 9.6 _Resignation; Vacancies_. The Seller Stockholder Representative may resign
or such agency may be changed by the Seller Stockholders from time to time
upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to Buyer; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Seller Stockholder Representative may not be removed
unless holders of at least a majority of the Seller capital stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing agree to such removal and to the identity of
the substituted agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a vacancy in the
position of the Seller Stockholder Representative may be filled by the
holders of a majority of the Seller capital stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Closing. The immunities and rights to indemnification shall
survive the resignation or removal of the Seller Stockholder Representative
or any member of the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

9.7  _Survival_. The powers, immunities and rights to indemnification granted
to the Seller Stockholder Representative Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with
an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death,
incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of any Seller Stockholder and shall
be binding on any successor thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an
assignment by any Seller Stockholder of the whole or any fraction of his, her
or its interest in the Escrow Fund. All actions taken by the Seller
Stockholder Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement shall
be binding upon each Seller Stockholder and such Seller Stockholders
successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by such Seller
Stockholder, and all defenses which may be available to any Seller Stockholder
to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the Seller Stockholder
Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement are waived.

_Article VII_ with respect to the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller
Indemnified Parties; _provided_ , _further_ , except that Converge Buyer is an
express third party beneficiary of _Section 5.14_ and _Section 5.20_.

10.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Business Disclosure Schedule and
the Ancillary Agreements (including the documents referred to herein and
therein) constitute the entire agreement among the Parties and supersedes any
prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the Parties,
written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement which shall remain in effect as contemplated by
_Section 5.8_.

 

10.4 _Succession and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties named herein and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this Agreement or
any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of the other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller may
assign this Agreement to an acquirer so long as the transferee assumes all of
the obligations of Seller set forth herein. No such assignment shall release
Seller of its obligations hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, if Buyer
or any of its successors or assigns shall transfer all or substantially all
of the properties and assets of the Business to any Person, then, as a
condition to such transfer, proper provisions shall be made so that (i) the
transferee shall assume all of the obligations of Buyer set forth herein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall remain ultimately liable for Buyers
obligations hereunder; and (ii) Seller is an express third party beneficiary
to such transfer for the purpose of enforcing this _Section 10.4_ in respect
of the transferee. If Seller or any of its successors or assigns shall
transfer all or substantially all of the Excluded Assets and Excluded
Liabilities to any Person, or if any Person shall acquire Seller (whether by
stock sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise) then, as a condition to such
transaction, proper provisions shall be made so that (i) the transferee or
successor shall assume all of the obligations of Seller set forth herein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall remain ultimately liable for
Sellers obligations hereunder; and (ii) Buyer is an express third party
beneficiary to such transfer for the purpose of enforcing this  _Section
10.4_ in respect of the transferee or successor.

10.5 _Counterparts and Facsimile Signature_. This Agreement may be executed
in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Party, it
being understood that all

 



-81-  Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Until and unless each Party has
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other Party, this Agreement shall
have no effect and no Party shall have any right or obligation hereunder
(whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). Any signature page delivered electronically or by facsimile
(including transmission by Portable Document Format or other fixed
image form) shall be binding to the same extent as an original signature
page.

10.6 _Headings_. The table of contents and headings in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only, shall not be deemed to be a part of this
Agreement, and shall not be referred to in connection with the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 

10.7 _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally or by commercial
messenger or courier service, or mailed by overnight, registered or certified

-83- Any Party may change the address to which notices, requests, demands, claims,
and other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other
Party notice in the manner herein set forth.

10.8 _Governing Law; Exclusive Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of Laws thereof. Each of the Parties irrevocably (a)
consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any court within the State
of Delaware, in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this
Agreement or the matters contemplated herein; (b) agrees that process may be
served upon them in any manner authorized by the Laws of the State of Delaware
for such Persons; and (c) waives and covenants not to assert or plead any
objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue and
process. Each Party agrees not to commence any legal proceedings related
hereto except in such courts.

10.9  _Amendments, Extensions and Waivers_. This Agreement may be amended by
the Parties at any time prior to Closing by execution of an instrument in
writing signed by Buyer, Seller and the Seller Stockholder Representative and
at any time following the Closing by execution of an instrument in writing
signed by Buyer, Seller and the Seller Stockholder Representative. At any time
prior to the Closing, Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations of the other Party; (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties made to such Party contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) waive compliance with any of
the covenants, agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
by such Party.

10.10 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 



-84- 10.11 _Expenses_. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Parties
shall bear their respective direct and indirect expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions, whether or not the Transactions are
consummated.

 

10.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that immediate, extensive and
irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of it
hereunder to consummate the Transactions) are not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or are otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties
agree that, if for any reason Buyer or Seller shall have failed to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or otherwise breached this Agreement, then
the Party seeking to enforce this Agreement against such nonperforming Party
under this Agreement shall be entitled to specific performance and the
issuance of immediate injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money
damages as a remedy or posting any bond or providing other security, and the
Parties further agree to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with the obtaining of any such injunctive or other
equitable relief, this being in addition to and not in limitation of any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each Party agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of any injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that the other Party has an adequate
remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity. The Parties agree that (a) by
seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section 10.12_, a Party shall not
in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to a Party under this Agreement, including monetary damages in the
event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section 10.12_ are not available or otherwise
are not granted; and (b) nothing contained in this _Section 10.12_ shall
require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any Partys right
to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section
10.12_ before exercising any termination right under _Article VIII_ (and, if
applicable, pursuing damages after such termination) nor shall the
commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 10.12_ or
anything contained in this  _Section 10.12_ restrict or limit any Partys
right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article
VIII_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available
then or thereafter.

 

10.13 _Dispute Resolution Procedures_.

 

(a) In the event that either (1) an Indemnifying Party delivers an Objection
Notice to an Indemnified Party pursuant to  _Section 7.4(b)_ and the other
Party delivers a written notice disputing such Objection Notice within the
time period set forth in, and in accordance with, _Section 7.4(c)_ or (2) any
Party gives the other Party written notice relating to (A) an alleged breach
or failure of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.4_
or (B) whether any equipment constitutes a Transferred Asset (the notice
disputing an Objection Notice, and the notices described in (2), each a "
_Dispute Notice_ "), the Parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute
following the procedures set forth in this _Section 10.13_ (the " _Dispute
Resolution Procedures_ ").

 



-85- (b) Upon delivery and receipt of a Dispute Notice, each of the Parties (with
the Seller representing any Seller Indemnified Party, and the Buyer
representing any Buyer Indemnified Party), shall delegate officers of each
Party who have authority to settle the dispute and such officers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to resolve any dispute arising out
of or relating to this Agreement. In particular, the Parties shall attempt to
resolve any dispute relating to (1) an alleged breach or failure of the
representations and warranties set forth in  _Section 3.4_, or (2) whether
any equipment constitutes a Transferred Asset, including, in each case,
Indemnification Claims with respect thereto, by the delivery or licensing of
assets to Buyer such that the representations in  _Section 3.4_, would be
true, complete and accurate were such representations made on the date of such
delivery of licensing. Each Party may give the other party involved written
notice (a " _Response Notice_ ") of any dispute not so resolved within
fifteen (15) business days following receipt by such Party of a Dispute
Notice. The Dispute Notice and the Response Notice shall each include: (i) a
statement of each Partys position(s) regarding the matter(s) in dispute and
a summary of arguments in support thereof, and (ii) the name and title of the
officer who will represent such Party and any other Person who will accompany
that officer.

 

(c) Within 10 business days following delivery of the Response Notice, the
designated officer of each Party shall meet at a mutually agreed time and
place, and thereafter, as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to attempt
to resolve the dispute. All negotiations conducted pursuant to this _Section
10.13_ (and any of the Parties submissions in contemplation hereof) shall be
kept confidential by the Parties and shall be treated by the Parties and their
representatives as compromise and settlement negotiations under the Federal
Rules of Evidence and any similar state rules.

 

(d) In the event that the Parties are unable to resolve any dispute arising
out of this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of this  _Section
10.13_ within 30 days after delivery of any Dispute Notice, either Party may
submit such dispute for final adjudication to the applicable court sitting in
the State of Delaware in accordance with _Section 10.8_.

 

10.14 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
(a) each Party shall have any and all remedies available to it, at law or in
equity; (b) any and all remedies available to a Party shall be cumulative
with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this Agreement, at
law or in equity; and (c) the exercise by a Party of any one remedy shall not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

10.15 _Guaranty_. Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees
the prompt and full discharge by Buyer of all of Buyers covenants,
agreements, obligations and liabilities under this Agreement, including the
due and punctual payment of all amounts which are or may become due
and payable by Buyer hereunder when and as the same shall become due and
payable (collectively, the

 



-86-  " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "), in accordance with the terms hereof.
Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that, with respect to all Guaranteed
Obligations to pay money, such guaranty shall be a guaranty of payment and
performance and not of collection and shall not be conditioned or contingent
upon the pursuit of any remedies against Buyer. If Buyer shall default in the
due and punctual performance of any Guaranteed Obligation, including the full
and timely payment of any amount due and payable pursuant to any Guaranteed
Obligation, Guarantor will forthwith perform or cause to be performed such
Guaranteed Obligation and will forthwith make full payment of any amount due
with respect thereto at its sole cost and expense. The liabilities and
obligations of Guarantor pursuant to this Agreement are unconditional and
absolute and shall not be released, discharged or otherwise affected by any
change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Buyer or
Guarantor or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar
proceeding affecting any of them or their assets. Guarantor hereby waives any
right, whether legal or equitable, statutory or non-statutory, to require
Seller to proceed against or take any action against or pursue any remedy with
respect to Buyer or any other Person or make presentment or demand for
performance or give any notice of nonperformance before Seller may enforce
its rights hereunder against Guarantor. Guarantors obligations hereunder
shall remain in full force and effect until the Guaranteed Obligations shall
have been performed in full. If at any time any performance by any Person of
any Guaranteed Obligation is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or
returned, whether upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of Buyer
or otherwise, Guarantors obligations hereunder with respect to such
Guaranteed Obligation shall be reinstated at such time as though such
Guaranteed Obligation had become due and had not been performed.
