-v-     MERGER AGREEMENT   This Merger Agreement ("Agreement") is made
as of May 14, 2002 by and among ENSCO International Incorporated, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Chore Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Merger Sub"), and Chiles Offshore Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company").
Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit
A.   PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS   A. Parent, Merger Sub and Company intend to
effect a merger of Company into Merger Sub in accordance with this Agreement
and the Delaware General Corporation Law ("Merger"). Upon consummation of the
Merger, Company will cease to exist, and Merger Sub will continue as a direct
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.   B. It is intended that the Merger
qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code").   C. The respective
boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and Company have approved this
Agreement and approved the Merger.   D. In order to induce Parent and Merger
Sub to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of Company have
executed the Voting Agreements ("Voting Agreements") in the forms attached as
Exhibit B.   AGREEMENT   The parties, intending to be legally bound, agree
as follows:   ARTICLE 1   DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION  1.1 MERGER OF
COMPANY INTO MERGER SUB   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3),
Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub, and the separate existence
of Company shall cease. Following the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall
continue as the surviving corporation ("Surviving Corporation"). The name of
the Surviving Corporation shall be Chiles Offshore Inc.  1.2 EFFECTS OF THE
MERGER   The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and
in the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation
Law.      1.3 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME   The consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions ("Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Baker and McKenzie, 2001 Ross Avenue, Suite 2300, Dallas, Texas, at 10:00 a.m.
(or such other place and time as the parties may agree) on a date to be
specified by the parties ("Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the
third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be
satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in Articles 6, 7 and 8 (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions).
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, a certificate of merger
satisfying the applicable requirements of the Delaware General Corporation
Law ("Certificate of Merger") shall be duly executed by Merger Sub and,
simultaneously with or as soon as practicable following the Closing, filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware ("Secretary of State").
The Merger shall become effective upon the later of: (a) the date and time of
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State, or (b)
such later date and time as may be specified in the Certificate of Merger
with the consent of Parent ("Effective Time").  1.4 CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS; DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS   At the Effective
Time:   (a) the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as amended at
the Effective Time as set forth in Exhibit C, shall be the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance
with applicable Law;   (b) the Bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the
Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended
in accordance with applicable Law; and   (c) the directors and officers of
the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the
respective individuals who are directors and officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time.  1.5 CONVERSION OF SHARES   (a)
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or any stockholder of Company:  
(i) any shares of Company Common Stock held immediately prior to the
Effective Time by Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of Company (or held
in Company\'s treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;  
(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock held immediately prior to the
Effective Time by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;    2    
(iii) except as provided in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 1.5(a) and
subject to Sections 1.5(b) and 1.5(c), each share of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive (A) 0.6575 (the "Exchange Ratio") of a share of Parent
Common Stock (the "Common Stock Consideration") and (B) $5.25 in cash (the
"Cash Consideration" and, together with the Common Stock Consideration,
the "Merger Consideration"); and   (iv) each share of the common stock,
$0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.   (b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock are changed into a different number or class of shares by reason
of any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split, combination,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Exchange Ratio and the Cash Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted.   (c) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
in connection with the Merger, and no certificates or scrip for any such
fractional shares shall be issued. Any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of
Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable to such holder) shall, in lieu of such fraction of a share
and, upon surrender of such holder\'s Company Stock Certificate(s) (as
defined in Section 1.6), be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the
nearest whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such
fraction by the closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE
on the date on which the Effective Time occurs.  1.6 CLOSING OF COMPANY\'S
TRANSFER BOOKS   At the Effective Time:   (a) all certificates for shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(a "Company Stock Certificate") shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and all holders of certificates representing shares
of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as stockholders of Company
except as set forth in Sections 1.7 and 1.11; and   (b) the stock transfer
books of Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further
transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such
stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
a valid Company Stock Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent (as
defined in Section 1.7(a)) or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such
Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as
provided in Section 1.7.    3    1.7 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   (a)
Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to Company to act as exchange agent in respect
of the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). Prior to or at the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit
of holders of Company Common Stock, (i) certificates representing the shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable as the Common Stock Consideration pursuant
to Section 1.5(a)(iii)(A) and (ii) the amount of cash sufficient to pay
the aggregate amount of the Cash Consideration to be paid pursuant to
Section 1.5(a)(iii)(B) and the aggregate amount of cash sufficient to make
payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.5(c) and
any dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time to which holders of
Company Stock Certificates exchangeable for Parent Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement are entitled. The shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
amounts so deposited with the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or
distributions received by the Exchange Agent with respect to such shares, are
referred to collectively as the "Exchange Fund."   (b) As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to the record holders of Company Stock Certificates
(i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that
delivery of Company Stock Certificates shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of such Company Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock Certificates
in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Company Stock
Certificate to the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed
letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required
by the Exchange Agent or Parent, (x) the holder of such Company Stock
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (i) a
certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
Section 1.5 and (ii) a check in the amount equal to the cash that such holder
has a right to receive pursuant to Section 1.5 (including any cash in lieu of
any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled as
contemplated by this Section 1.7) and (y) each Company Stock Certificate so
surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 1.7, each Company Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after
the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive
Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock) as contemplated by Article 1 (including any dividends or other
distributions as contemplated by Section 1.7(d)). If any Company Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Merger
Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond
(in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.   (c)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
Merger Consideration shall be paid in exchange for any Company Stock
Certificate to any Person who may be an "affiliate" (as that term is used in
Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of Company until    4    such Person
shall have delivered to Parent and Company a duly executed
Affiliate Agreement as contemplated by Section 5.7.   (d) No dividends or
other distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with
a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive in the Merger until
such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this
Section 1.7 (at which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the
effect of applicable escheat or similar Laws, to receive all such
dividends and distributions, without interest).   (e) Any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of Company Stock
Certificates as of the date one year after the date on which the Effective
Time occurs shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of
Company Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their Company
Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look
only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for Merger Consideration,
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.   (f) Each of the
Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common
Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law or under
any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.   (g) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other
Person with respect to any shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts, delivered to
any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property Law,
escheat Law or similar Law.  1.8 STOCK OPTIONS   (a) As soon as
practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee of the board of directors of Company administering
the Company Stock Option Plan) shall take such action as may be required to
effect the following provisions of this Section 1.8(a). Subject to the
provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, as of the Effective Time each
option to purchase Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company Stock Option
Plan (a "Company Stock Option") that is then outstanding shall be assumed by
Parent and converted into an option (or a new substitute option shall
be granted) (an "Assumed Stock Option") exercisable for such amount of cash
and shares of Parent Company Stock as would have been received in respect of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option had such Company
Stock Option been exercised in full immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such that, immediately after the Effective Time, (i) a Company Stock Option
for one share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into an
Assumed    5    Stock Option exercisable for the Merger Consideration
at the exercise price in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) any restriction on the exercise of any such Company Stock Option and
other provisions of such Company Stock Option in effect at the Effective Time
(after taking into account any vesting that may result from the approval or
consummation of the Merger) shall otherwise remain unchanged; provided,
however, that each Company Option assumed by Parent in accordance with this
Section 1.8 (and the cash to be received by the holder upon exercise thereof)
shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as
appropriate to reflect any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction.   (b) As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the
holders of Company Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such
holders\' rights pursuant to the Company Option Plan and the agreements
evidencing the grants of such Company Stock Options and that such Company
Stock Options and agreements have been assumed by Parent and shall continue
in effect on the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time (subject to the provisions of this Section 1.8). Parent
shall comply with the terms of the Company Option Plan and ensure, to
the extent required by, and subject to the provisions of, the Company Option
Plan, that the Company Stock Options which qualified as qualified stock
options prior to the Effective Time continue to qualify as qualified stock
options after the Effective Time.   (c) Parent shall take such actions as
are reasonably necessary for the assumption of the Company Option Plan
pursuant to this Section 1.8, including the reservation, issuance and using
its Reasonable Efforts to provide for the listing of Parent Common Stock as
is necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 1.8.
Parent shall use its Reasonable Efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-8 or other appropriate form with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Assumed Stock Options and to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements covering such Assumed Stock Options (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such Assumed Stock Options remain outstanding. With respect to those
individuals, if any, who subsequent to the Effective Time will be subject to
the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act,
where applicable, Parent shall use all Reasonable Efforts to administer the
Company Option Plans assumed pursuant to this Section 1.8 in a manner that
complies with Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent the
Company Option Plan complied with such rule prior to the Merger.  1.9 TAX
CONSEQUENCES   For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.
The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of
the United States Treasury Regulations.  1.10 FURTHER ACTION   If, at any
time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent to
be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to
vest the Surviving    6    Corporation with full right, title and
possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and Company, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully
authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of Company and otherwise)
to take such action.  1.11 DISSENTING SHARES   Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has delivered a written
demand for appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted
as provided in Section 1.5 of this Agreement, unless and until such holder
fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses his right to appraisal and
payment under the Delaware General Corporation Law. If, after the Effective
Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses his
right to appraisal, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.5(a)(iii) hereof, together
with any dividends or distributions payable thereon or cash in lieu of
fractional shares, and to which such holder is entitled, without interest
thereon. Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by
Company for appraisal of Company Common Stock, and prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective
Time, Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle, any such demands.
Parent covenants and agrees that, in the event any cash payment is to be made
following the Effective Time in respect of Dissenting Shares (as a result of
a judgment, settlement or otherwise), Parent shall contribute to the capital
of the Surviving Corporation an amount sufficient to make such payment, and
no funds or other assets of the Surviving Corporation shall, directly or
indirectly, be used for such purpose.   ARTICLE 2   REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF COMPANY   Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub that, except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule:  2.1
ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING   (a) Company has no Subsidiaries, except for
the Entities identified in Section 2.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
and neither Company nor any of the other Entities identified in Section
2.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule owns any capital stock of, or any
equity interest of any nature in, any other Entity, other than the Entities
identified in Section 2.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. (Company and
each of the Entities identified on Section 2.1(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule are referred to collectively in this Agreement as the "Acquired
Companies.") None of the Acquired Companies has agreed or is obligated to
make, or is bound by any Contract under which it may become obligated to
make, any future investment in or capital contribution to any other Entity.
None of the Acquired Companies has, at any time, been a general partner of
any general partnership, limited    7    partnership or other Entity.
Section 2.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a list of the
jurisdiction of formation of each of the Acquired Companies and other
jurisdictions in which each Acquired Company is authorized to do
business.   (b) Company is a corporation, and each Subsidiary is a
corporation or a limited liability company, in each case duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization, with full corporate or other power and authority to conduct its
business as presently conducted, to own or use the properties and assets that
it purports to own or use, and to perform all its obligations under all
Company Contracts to which it is a party. Each Acquired Company is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign entity and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which either the ownership or use of the properties owned or
used by it, or the nature of the activities conducted by it, requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or to be in good
standing does not and is not reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   (c) Company has delivered to Parent copies of the
Governing Documents of each of the Acquired Companies, as currently in
effect. Neither Company nor any Subsidiary is in violation of any provision
of its Governing Documents.  2.2 ENFORCEABILITY; NO CONFLICT   (a)
Assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and

or other communication from any Governmental Body or any other Person
alleging any Contravention of any Governmental Authorization.

the Governmental Authorizations necessary to permit the Parent to conduct
its business lawfully in the manner in which it currently conducts such
business and to permit Parent to own and use its assets in the manner in
which it owns and uses such assets currently, except, in each case, where the

former employees of the Acquired Companies under the plans continued or to be

4980B of the Code and ERISA Section 601 et seq. ("COBRA Coverage") for any
individuals receiving COBRA Coverage under the Chiles Offshore Health Care
Benefits Plan (the "Medical Plan") as of the Effective Time and for any
employees of the Acquired Companies and their dependents who become eligible
for and elect COBRA Coverage as a result of the Contemplated Transactions;
provided, however, nothing contained herein shall obligate Parent to extend
COBRA Coverage beyond its normal expiration period. As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, the Acquired Companies shall transfer to Parent or,
if directed by Parent, to the Surviving Corporation, any assets, including
any insurance policies, held by the Acquired Companies supporting the payment
of benefits under the Medical Plan, the Chiles Offshore Inc. group vision

or after the Effective Time the Chiles Offshore Inc. 401(k) Retirement
Savings Plan (the "401(k) Plan") or any Group Insurance Plan, liquidate the
assets of any trust or funding arrangement for any such plan and settle all

cause all of their respective employee benefit and compensation plans
(including, without limitation, pension, profit-sharing, retirement, savings,
401(k), vacation, paid time-off, employee, and other employee financial,
welfare or other benefit plans) covering or otherwise benefiting any of the
employees of Company who are employed by the Surviving Corporation on or
after the Effective Time (the "Assumed Employees") to count any actual
service performed for any Acquired Company as    37    recognized by
any Acquired Company under the terms of the Company Plans,
without duplication of benefits, for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting and benefit accrual to the same extent such service was recognized
under the Company Plans. If Parent determines to terminate or merge the
401(k) Plan or any Group Insurance Plan into its plans, the Assumed Employees
who are then employed by the Surviving Corporation shall be eligible to
participate immediately in the similar plans sponsored and maintained by
Parent for its employees and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall also
cause all waiting periods under each such plan of Parent to be waived, to the
extent necessary, with respect to such Assumed Employees.   (c) Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall give Assumed Employees credit, for purposes
of Parent\'s and the Surviving Corporation\'s vacation and/or other paid
leave benefit programs, for such employees accrued and unpaid vacation and/or
paid leave balance as of the Effective Time.   (d) Parent agrees to the
terms and conditions of the compensation arrangements specified in Exhibit
E.   (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) confer
upon any Assumed Employee any right to continued employment after the
Effective Time or (ii) prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from
reserving or exercising the right to amend, modify, change or terminate or
otherwise alter any of the provisions of, or benefits provided under, any of
the Company Plans, that are assumed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation.  5.5 INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS   (a) All
rights to indemnification existing in favor of those Persons who are, or
were, directors and officers of Company at or prior to the date of this
Agreement ("Indemnified Persons") shall survive the Merger and shall
be observed by the Surviving Corporation to the fullest extent permitted
by Delaware Law for a period of six years from the Effective Time, and
Parent hereby guarantees the performance of such obligations, it being
understood that any Person entitled to the benefits thereof may proceed
directly against Parent without first proceeding against the Surviving
Corporation.   (b) From the Effective Time until September 18, 2006, the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of the
Indemnified Persons with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time, the existing policy of directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance maintained by Company as of the date of this Agreement in the form
disclosed by Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement ("Existing
Policy"); provided, however, that (i) the Surviving Corporation may
substitute for the Existing Policy a policy or policies of comparable
coverage and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay
annual premiums for the Existing Policy (or for any substitute policies) in
excess of $200,000 in the aggregate. In the event any future annual premiums
for the Existing Policy (or any substitute policies) exceeds $200,000 in the
aggregate, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to reduce the amount
of coverage of the Existing Policy (or any substitute policies) to the amount
of coverage that can be obtained for a premium equal to $200,000.

before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statement
with respect to the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions.

Act) of Company to execute and deliver to Parent, prior to the date of the
mailing of the Proxy Statement to Company\'s stockholders, an Affiliate
Agreement in the form of Exhibit D (each, an "Affiliate Agreement").   (b)
Company shall terminate the agreements identified in Section 5.7(b) of the

Parent, Merger Sub, and Company shall use its Reasonable Efforts as may be
required to cause the Contemplated Transactions and any other dispositions
of equity securities of Company (including derivative securities) or
acquisitions of equity securities of Parent by each individual who (a) is a
director or officer of Company, or (b) at the Effective Time will become a
director or officer of Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated

to Company, and Baker and McKenzie, counsel to Parent, certificates at such
time or times as reasonably requested by such law firms in connection with
their respective deliveries of opinions to the effect that the Merger will be
treated for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368 of the Code. Prior to the Effective Time, none of
Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall take or cause to be taken any action
which would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any
action which would cause to be untrue) any of the representations in such
previously-agreed certificates.   ARTICLE 6   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO

Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in

(collectively, the "Third-Party Provisions"). The Third-Party Provisions
may be enforced by the beneficiaries thereof.  10.9 ENFORCEMENT OF
AGREEMENT   The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.    48    10.10
WAIVER   The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are

of the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of
such right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such
right, power or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such
right, power or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) no claim or
right arising out of this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in
this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a
waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in a written document
signed by the other party, (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be
applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given and (c) no

obligation of that party or of the right of the party giving such notice or
demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this
Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.  10.11 GOVERNING
LAW   This Agreement will be governed by and construed under the Laws of
the State of Delaware without regard to conflicts of Laws principles that

any objection it may now or hereafter have to venue or to convenience of
forum. The parties agree that any or all of them may file a copy of this
Section with any court as written evidence of the knowing, voluntary and
bargained agreement between the parties irrevocably to waive any objections
to venue or to convenience of forum. Process in any Proceeding referred to in

further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or any of
the documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one party,

provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in
this Agreement.  5.10 GOVERNING LAW   This Agreement will be governed by
and construed under the Laws of Delaware without regard to conflicts of Law

Delaware, County of New Castle, or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Each of the
parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such court
in any such Proceeding, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to
venue or to convenience of forum and acknowledges that such
exclusive jurisdiction benefits both parities. The parties agree that any or
all of them may file a copy of this Section with any court as written
evidence of the knowing, voluntary and bargained agreement between the
parties irrevocably to waive any objections to venue or to convenience of
forum. Process in any Proceeding referred to in this Section may be served on
any party anywhere in the world. Stockholder irrevocably appoints The

Stockholder irrevocably consents to service of process given in the manner
provided for notices in Section 5.1. Nothing in this Agreement will affect
the right of Parent to serve process in any other manner permitted by
law.  5.12 COUNTERPARTS   This Agreement may be executed in one or more

earliest of (a) the Effective Time, (b) the termination of the Merger

the other party, (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will
be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given, and (c)

to this Agreement or any Contemplated Transaction must be brought in the
courts of the State of Delaware, County of New Castle, or, if it has or can

it may now or hereafter have to venue or to convenience of forum and
acknowledges that such exclusive jurisdiction benefits both parities. The
parties agree that any or all of them may file a copy of this Section with
any court as written evidence of the knowing, voluntary and bargained
agreement between the parties irrevocably to waive any objections to venue or
to convenience of forum. Process in any Proceeding referred to in this

process agent acceptable to Parent. Stockholder irrevocably consents to
service of process given in the manner provided for notices in Section 5.1.

EXHIBIT D   AFFILIATE AGREEMENT    D-1    FORM OF  AFFILIATE
AGREEMENT  ENSCO International Incorporated 1445 Ross Avenue, Suite
2700 Dallas, Texas 75202  Gentlemen:   I have been advised that as of the
date of this letter I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Chiles Offshore
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), as the term "affiliate" is
defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of "Rule 145" under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (including the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the "Act"). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger
Agreement dated May ____, 2002 (the "Agreement"), between ENSCO International
Incorporated, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Chore Acquisition, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"),
and Company, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Company (the "Merger").
Terms used but not defined in this letter shall have the meanings assigned to
such terms in the Agreement.   In connection with the Contemplated
Transactions, I may receive shares of Parent Common Stock.   I represent,
warrant and covenant to Parent that in the event I receive any Parent Common
Stock as a result of the Merger:   A. I shall not make any sale, transfer or
other disposition of  Parent Common Stock in violation of the Act.   B. I
have carefully read this letter and the Agreement and  discussed the
requirements of such documents and other applicable  limitations upon my
ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of  Parent Common Stock to the
extent I felt necessary with my counsel or  counsel for Company.   C. I
have been advised that the issuance of Parent Common  Stock to me in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions has been  registered with the
SEC under the Act on a Registration Statement on  Form S-4. However, I have
also been advised that, since, at the time  the Agreement was submitted to a
vote of the stockholders of Company, I  may be deemed to have been an
affiliate of Company and the distribution  by me of Parent Common Stock has
not been registered under the Act, I  may be prohibited from selling,
transferring or otherwise disposing of  Parent Common Stock issued to me in
connection with the Contemplated  Transactions unless (i) such sale, transfer
or other disposition has  been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale,
transfer or other  disposition is made in conformity with Rule 145, or (iii)
in the  opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent, or a "no
action"  letter obtained by the undersigned from the staff of the SEC, such 
sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from  registration
under the Act.       D. I understand that Parent is under no obligation
to register  the sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent Common Stock
by me or  on my behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary
in  order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration 
available.   Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission
on my part that I am an "affiliate" of Company as described in the first
paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to
any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this
letter.    Very truly yours,     ---------------------------------

funded with $500,000 to be allocated among the non-officer employees of
Company as determined by Bill Chiles ("Chiles") and Don Gregg ("Gregg") for
their efforts in completing the transaction contemplated by the Agreement
(the "Bonus Pool"), to assist Company in maintaining critical staff,
including an allocation to the six most senior rig based employees per
rig.  PERFORMANCE AND STAY BONUSES POTENTIALLY PAYABLE TO CHILES AND
GREGG.  Parent agrees to continue the current employment agreement between
Company and Chiles as modified by this Program and to offer Chiles a position
as a Vice President working in metropolitan Houston. Upon acceptance of the
position, Chiles will receive $280,000 per year in base salary payable in
accordance with Parent\'s standard payroll practices for management employees
and full eligibility for all medical and other benefits and profit sharing
programs for Vice Presidents of Parent, and stock and option grants as
approved by the Board of Directors of Parent. Chiles\' Performance Bonus
shall be payable at the Effective Time. Chiles\' Stay Bonus shall vest on a
monthly basis and be payable on an annual basis during his employment with
Parent. If Chiles accepts a position with Parent, the balance of any unpaid
Stay Bonus (vested and unvested) shall be payable if he is subsequently
terminated or constructively terminated by Parent without cause (defined in a
similar manner as in his current employment agreement) within two years of
commencement of employment with Parent; provided that acceptance by Chiles of
employment with Parent under the terms and conditions of this Program shall
not be considered a constructive termination under his employment agreement.
If Chiles does not accept Parent\'s offer of a position, he will not receive
the Stay Bonus, but shall receive (i) his Performance Bonus at the Effective
Time and (ii) $840,000 in severance payments in 36 equal monthly payments
commencing with the month following the Effective Time.     Gregg shall
receive all of his Performance Bonus and his severance payment at the
Effective Time, if he does not accept a position with Parent. If Gregg enters
into part-time employment with Parent, (i) he shall receive the same salary
and comparable medical and similar benefits as he currently receives
with Company, and (ii) at Gregg\'s option, $200,000 to $300,000 of his
Performance Bonus will be deferred and paid at such future date determined by
Gregg.  PERFORMANCE AND STAY BONUSES PAYABLE TO THE OTHER CORPORATE OFFICERS
(BRUMLEY, HOPKINS, PADILLA, PINKARD AND GOSS) AND EMPLOYEES. All of the
Performance Bonuses payable to the Corporate Officers (other than Chiles and
Gregg) shall be payable at the Effective Time. If any such Corporate Officer
accepts employment with Parent, one-half of his Stay Bonus shall be payable
at the first anniversary of his employment and the remaining one-half shall
be payable at the second anniversary of his employment. If employment is not
offered to any such Corporate Officer or a position that does not have
comparable pay and benefits (irrespective of title or location of employment)
is offered but not accepted, 15% of the Stay Bonus for that Corporate Officer
shall be payable at the Effective Time (together with the severance payment
discussed below). If a Corporate Officer is offered and accepts employment
with Parent, the balance of any unpaid Stay Bonus shall be payable to him if
he is subsequently terminated by Parent without cause (as defined in the
current Severance Benefits Agreement covering such Corporate Officer) within
two years of his commencement of employment with Parent. Each employee
receiving an allocation of money from the Bonus Pool shall receive 100% of
his allocated bonus at the Effective Time.  DEFERRED BONUSES. All Deferred
Bonuses shall vest immediately and become payable at the Effective
Time.  EXISTING COMPANY OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK. Except as provided in
the next sentence, all outstanding Company options shall vest immediately and
convert automatically to options of Parent as provided in Section 1.8 of the
Agreement, at the same ratio as the overall transaction between Company and
Parent. If Chiles accepts a position with Parent, he may agree to modify the
vesting schedule of his unvested options and restricted stock. If Chiles is
terminated or constructively terminated (as defined in this Program) without
cause, all of his unvested options and restricted stock will immediately
vest.  If Chiles and Gregg do not accept positions with Parent, Chiles and
Gregg will each have two years from the Effective Time to exercise any and
all options, irrespective of any offer of employment with Parent. If Chiles
and Gregg accept employment with Parent, Chiles and Gregg will each have the
remaining term of his options within which to exercise his options. If Chiles
or Gregg is terminated by Parent without cause, he will have two years within
which to exercise his options, such period not to exceed the remaining term
of the applicable option period. If Chiles or Gregg is terminated by Parent
with cause or voluntarily terminates his employment with Parent, he will have
a      minimum of one year within the first year after the Effective
Time and thereafter three months after the termination of his employment with
Parent to exercise his options.  If any of the other Corporate Officers
(other than Chiles and Gregg) does not accept employment with Parent, he will
have one year from the Effective Time to exercise his options. If he accepts
employment with Parent, any such Corporate Officer will have the remaining
term of his options within which to exercise the options. If any such
Corporate Officer is terminated without cause, he will have one year within
which to exercise his options, such period not to exceed the remaining term
of the option period. If any such Corporate Officer is terminated with cause
or voluntarily terminates his employment, he will have a minimum of one year
after the Effective Time and thereafter three months after termination of his
employment with Parent to exercise his options.  If the remaining employees
do not accept employment with Parent, they would have three months from the
Effective Time to exercise their options. If the employees accept employment
with Parent, they would have until (i) three months after termination of
employment with Parent, or (ii) the original term of the Company option,
whichever is shorter.  Subject to Chiles rights described above, all
restricted stock shall vest immediately and be unrestricted as of the
Effective Time.  SEVERANCE PAYMENTS. The severance payable under the
employment contract of Chiles shall be payable in full if Chiles\' employment
is terminated up to one year from commencement of his employment with Parent.
If, however, Chiles remains employed for more than one year but less than
three (3) years, he will be entitled to the pro-rata portion of his severance
payments such that after three years of being employed by Parent, he will not
be entitled to any severance payments other than what might be provided to
him as an employee of Parent. As provided in his current employment
agreement, Chiles may terminate the non-compete provisions at any time by
waiving his right to receive any further severance payment. Gregg shall be
paid one year of severance under the existing Severance Benefits Agreement if
he is not offered or does not accept employment with Parent. If, however,
Gregg accepts (part-time) employment with Parent, at his existing salary, he
will be entitled to the pro-rata portion of his severance if his employment
ceases for any reason during the first year of his employment with Parent and
any deferred portion of his Performance Bonus shall be paid to him. Any
Corporate Officer (other than Chiles and Gregg) shall be paid severance equal
to one year of salary if he is not offered or does not accept employment with
Parent for whatever reason. Any such Corporate Officer who accepts employment
with Parent will not receive severance. The remaining Company employees have
no current severance arrangements. These employees (and the Corporate
Officers) shall be entitled to relocation expenses, temporary housing, etc.
if offered employment with Parent. Otherwise, the employees shall receive no
severance benefits other than allocations, if any, from the
Bonus Pool.      MEDICAL COVERAGE. Any Chiles employees (including the
officers) who do not accept employment with Parent will receive COBRA
benefits only as provided in Section 5.4(a) of the Agreement.  GROSS UP
PROVISIONS/GOLDEN PARACHUTE PAYMENTS. Neither Parent or Chiles shall
be liable in any way for any reimbursement or gross-up of income, excise or
other payroll taxes resulting from any payments described herein.     '
