Seller or any Transferred Entity is a party (including the Material
Contracts) (collectively, the "Interests"), if such Interest is not capable
of being sold, conveyed, transferred or assigned without any third-party
consent which has not been obtained by (or does not remain in full force and
effect at) the Closing, unless and until such third-party consent
with respect to such Interest (a "Retained Interest") is obtained, at which
time such Retained Interest shall be deemed to be sold, conveyed, transferred
and assigned in accordance with Section 1.1(d) and shall cease to be a
Retained Interest.

 

 

(ii) To the extent the third-party consents necessary to sell, convey,
transfer or assign any Interest has not been obtained (or does not remain in
full force and effect) as of the Closing, Sellers and Purchaser shall, while
such Interest remains a Retained Interest, use their commercially reasonable
best efforts to (A) cooperate in any reasonable and lawful arrangements
designed to provide the benefits of such Retained Interest to Purchaser,
subject to the terms of and to the extent permitted by such Interest and
Purchaser shall promptly pay or satisfy the corresponding liabilities and
obligations to the extent Purchaser would have been responsible therefor if
such third-party consent had been obtained, and such Retained Interest had
been transferred to Purchaser as of the Closing, but only to the extent
Purchaser obtains the benefits of such Retained Interest; and (B) enforce, at
the request of Purchaser, and subject to Purchaser's prompt reimbursement of
Sellers' out of pocket costs, any rights of Sellers arising from such
Retained Interest against the issuer thereof or the other party or parties
thereto (including the right to elect to terminate any such Retained Interest
in accordance with the terms thereof upon the advice of Purchaser). The
failure of any third-party consent under any Contract, lease, license or
other agreement to which Honeywell, any Seller or any Transferred Entity is a
party to be obtained or any circumstances resulting therefrom shall not,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute a Business Material Adverse
Effect or a breach by any Seller of any representation, warranty, condition,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement (other than, if breached,
Sections 3.4 and 5.5(b)), except with respect to the condition set forth in
Section 6.4.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser does not assume or agree to discharge or perform, and will not be
deemed by virtue of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any
document delivered at the Closing pursuant to this Agreement, or as a result
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to
have assumed, or to have agreed to discharge or perform, any liability,
obligation or indebtedness of Sellers, whether primary or secondary, direct

Excluded Environmental Matters.

 

 

1.5 Liabilities of the Transferred Entities. The parties agree that none of
the Liabilities of the Transferred Entities shall be assumed by Purchaser

trading days prior to the Closing Date (such 10-day period, the "VWAP
Measurement Period"); provided, however, that Purchaser shall have the
right, at Purchaser's option, which shall be communicated to Honeywell in
writing no later than one Business Day prior to the Closing Date, to
substitute cash for a portion of the Stock Consideration; provided,
further that in no event may Purchaser pay a number of shares of common stock
of the Purchaser that is less than 6,000,000 shares of common stock of
Purchaser; however, less than 6,000,000

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shares may be delivered so that the value of the shares delivered (as

At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Honeywell shall provide
Purchaser with an estimated statement of cash and cash equivalents of the
Transferred Entities as of the Effective Time (such amount, the "Estimated
Transferred Cash"). Honeywell shall use commercially reasonable best efforts
to cause the cash and cash equivalents of the Transferred Entities as of the
Effective Time to be distributed from the Transferred Entities to a
Seller (or any Affiliate of a Seller) prior to Closing; however
such distribution shall not be in violation of applicable Law. Prior to the
Closing, Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith to resolve
any disputes as to such amount of the Estimated Transferred Cash. At
the Closing, the Cash Consideration shall be increased by the amount of
any Estimated Transferred Cash. During the thirty (30) day period following
the Closing, Honeywell and Purchasers shall cooperate in good faith
to determine the actual amount of cash and cash equivalents of the
Transferred Entities as of the Effective Time (such amount, the "Actual
Transferred Cash"). The parties will submit to each other such
supporting documentation as necessary to determine the amount of the Actual
Transferred Cash. Following the final determination of Actual Transferred
Cash, (i) if the Estimated Transferred Cash exceeds the Actual Transferred
Cash, Sellers shall refund such excess amount to Purchaser in cash, and (ii)
if the Estimated Transferred Cash is less than the Actual Transferred Cash,
Purchasers shall pay such shortfall amount to Sellers in cash, in each case,
within three (3) Business Days by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account indicated by the applicable party. Any amounts paid
pursuant to this Section 1.7 shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase
Price.

forth on the disclosure schedule delivered by Honeywell to Purchaser
concurrently herewith (the "Disclosure Schedule"; which Disclosure Schedule
shall be arranged in sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered
sections of this Article III, and any information disclosed in any such
section of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed only for
purposes of the corresponding section of this Article III, unless it is
reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure contained in such section
of the Disclosure Schedule that such disclosure is applicable to
another section of this Article III):

 

 

3.1 Due Organization. Each of the Sellers and the Transferred Entities is a
legal entity of the type described in Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedule,
duly organized, validly existing and, with respect to entities organized
within the United States and any other jurisdiction outside the United States
in which the concept of good standing or its functional equivalent is
applicable, in good standing or its functional equivalent under the Laws of
the jurisdiction indicated in Section 3.1 of the Disclosure Schedule. Sellers
and the Transferred Entities (a) have all requisite power and authority to
conduct the Business as it is now being conducted, and (b) are duly qualified
or otherwise authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions in which
the ownership, operation or leasing of the Purchased Assets and the conduct
of the Business requires such entity to be so qualified or otherwise
authorized, except to the extent that the failure to be so licensed,
qualified, or otherwise authorized or in good standing would not result in
material Liability to the Business.

 

 

3.2 Authority. Each of the Sellers has the requisite corporate power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform its respective obligations under
this Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the Supply Agreement, the
Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the Intellectual Property License
Agreement, the Sublease, the Real Property Lease Assignments and the other
documents and agreements contemplated hereby and thereby to which such Seller
is a party (collectively, the "Transaction Documents") and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and
performance by each of the Sellers of the Transaction Documents to which such
Seller is a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
action on the part of the applicable Seller, and no other corporate or other
proceedings on the part of Honeywell or any Seller are necessary to authorize
the execution, delivery and performance by Honeywell and each Seller of this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
This Agreement has been, and upon their execution the Transaction Documents
shall have been, duly executed and delivered by Sellers, and, assuming due
authorization and delivery by Purchaser, this Agreement constitutes, and upon
their execution the Transaction Documents shall constitute, a valid and
binding obligation of Sellers, enforceable against Sellers in accordance with
their respective terms, except (i) as enforceability may be limited by

that specific performance may not be available in certain jurisdictions
outside the United States (collectively, the "Enforceability Exceptions").

only a translation has been provided, the translation) of the organizational
documents of the Transferred Entities, which have been Made Available to
Purchaser, are true, accurate and complete (except in the case of the

Schedule sets forth (i) the nature of the equity interest held by Sellers or
other Transferred Entities and, if applicable, the par value thereof, (ii)
the holder of such equity interests, (iii) the number of such equity
interests that are outstanding, and (iv) the percentage of the outstanding
equity interests held by Sellers or other Transferred Entities (each such
equity interest held by a Seller or Transferred Entity, an
"Equity Interest"). (i) The Equity Interests constitute, and on the Closing
Date will constitute, all of the issued and outstanding equity of each
Transferred Entity, (ii) Sellers and the Transferred Entities are not, and

and (iii) there are no shareholder agreements, voting trusts or proxies
or other agreements or understandings in effect with respect to the voting of
the Equity Interests. All Equity Interests have been duly issued and

by Purchaser. None of the issued Equity Interests was issued in violation of
any preemptive rights. Each Seller which holds an Equity Interest has good
title thereto and full beneficial ownership thereof and upon delivery of such
Equity Interest against payment therefor pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, Purchaser will receive good title thereto, free and clear of all
Encumbrances.

Documents or (y) result in material Liability to the Business or any material
adverse change in or material adverse effect on the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

ability of Sellers to perform their obligations under this Agreement or to

debts or liabilities beyond such Person's ability to pay such debts and
liabilities as they mature and (d) such Person is not engaged in business or

time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected to become an
actual or matured liability.

"flex provisions"), other than as set forth in the executed copies thereof
Made Available to Sellers, including in the Redacted Fee Letter. No
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would result in a breach or violation or constitute a default on the part of
Purchaser under any term or condition of the Debt Commitment Letter.

the terms of the Agreement, including payment of the Purchase Price and

that Purchaser agrees that such access will be requested in writing and
exercised during normal business hours and

without causing unreasonable interference with the operations of the
Business, and (ii) furnish to Purchaser or its representatives, upon
reasonable written request, such additional financial and operating data and

of this Agreement, Honeywell and Purchaser shall not, issue any press release
or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other
parties hereto, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
unless, in the reasonable judgment of Honeywell or Purchaser, disclosure is
otherwise required by applicable Law or by the applicable rules of any stock
exchange on which Honeywell or Purchaser lists its securities; provided that,
to the extent required by applicable Law or by the rules of any stock
exchange, the party intending to make such release or announcement shall use
its commercially reasonable best efforts consistent with such applicable Law
to consult with the other party with respect to the text thereof and,
provided further, that no party shall be required to obtain consent pursuant
to this Section 5.3 to the extent any proposed release or announcement is
consistent with information that has previously been made public without
breach of the obligations under this Section 5.3.

 

 

5.4 Books and Records.

 

 

(a) Sellers will use commercially reasonable best efforts to deliver or cause
to be delivered to Purchaser at Closing all properties, books, records,
Contracts, information and documents in their or their Affiliates' possession
relating primarily to the Business that are part of the Purchased Assets.
As soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing, Sellers will deliver
or cause to be delivered to Purchaser any remaining properties, books,
records, Contracts, information and documents relating primarily to the
Business that are part of the Purchased Assets that are not already in the
possession or control of the Purchaser; it being understood that such
properties, books, records, Contracts, information and documents described in
this subsection (a) shall have been Made Available to Purchaser prior to the
Closing Date, provided that certain materials subject to any confidentiality
obligations or attorney client privilege have not been so delivered.

 

 

(b) Each Seller and Purchaser agree that each of them will preserve and keep
the books of accounts, financial and other records held by it relating to the
Business (including accountants' work papers) for a period of seven (7) years
from the Closing Date in accordance with their respective corporate records
retention policies; provided, however, that prior to disposing of any such
records in accordance with such policies (if such records would be disposed
of prior to the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date), the applicable party
shall provide written notice to the other party of its intent to dispose of
such records and shall provide such other party the opportunity to take
ownership and possession of such records (at such other party's sole expense)
to the extent they relate to such other party's business or obligations
within 30 days after such notice is delivered. If such other party does not
confirm its intention in writing to take ownership and possession of such
records within such 30-day period, the party who possesses the records may
proceed with the disposition of such records. Sellers and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Purchaser shall make such records, other information relating to the
Business, employees and auditors available to the other as may be reasonably
required by such party (i) in connection with, among other things, any audit
or investigation of, insurance claims by, legal proceedings against, dispute
involving or governmental investigations of any Seller or Purchaser or any of
their respective Affiliates, (ii) in order to enable any Seller or Purchaser
to comply with their respective obligations under this Agreement and each
other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby or
(iii) for any other reasonable business purpose relating to any Seller,
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates.

 

 

5.5 Required Approvals; Consents.

 

 

(a) Subject to Section 7.4, Sellers and Purchaser shall each use their
commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including using all
commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary waivers,
consents, and approvals, and/or submitting any necessary notices, including
those required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976
(the "HSR Act") and applicable foreign antitrust Laws. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Seller and Purchaser agrees (i) to submit the required HSR
Act filing within the tenth (10th) business day after the date of this
Agreement and to submit promptly thereafter any filings required by antitrust
regulations of other jurisdictions including foreign countries; (ii) to use
commercially reasonable best efforts to comply as expeditiously as possible
with all lawful requests of the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice, or other governmental
competition authorities (the "Antitrust Agencies") for additional
information or documents; (iii) to use commercially reasonable best efforts
to cause the expeditious termination of the HSR Act waiting period; (iv) to
inform promptly the other parties of any material communications from any
Antitrust Agency regarding the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and
provide copies to the other party of all correspondence with any
Antitrust Agency relating to this Agreement; (v) and to provide promptly to
the other parties such information as the other parties may reasonably
request in order to enable them to prepare the filings, reports, documents
and other materials referred to in this section. Purchaser shall timely pay
all fees in connection with any filings with Antitrust Agencies.

 

 

(b) Sellers shall give promptly such notices to third parties and use its or
their commercially reasonable best efforts (which shall not include any
obligation of Sellers to pay any consideration therefor or agree to
relinquish or modify any rights in exchange therefor) to obtain the consents
listed on Section 3.4(b) of the Disclosure Schedule. Purchaser shall
cooperate with Sellers in their efforts to obtain such consents. Purchaser
shall pay any costs or expenses in obtaining such consents; provided,
however, that Purchaser shall have no obligation to give any guarantee or
other consideration of any nature in connection with any such consent or to
consent to any change in the terms of any agreement or arrangement which
Purchaser in its sole discretion may deem adverse to the interests of
Purchaser or the Business. Honeywell and Purchaser shall each use their best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do , or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to cause the closing
conditions in Sections 6.6 and 7.6 to be satisfied as expeditiously as
possible. In addition, and in any event, after the Closing Purchaser shall
use its commercially reasonable best efforts to include the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Business under Purchaser\'s quality management systems and under Purchaser\'s
separate AC0056 Distributor Holder Approval Status as promptly
as practicable.

 

 



 

(c) Without limiting Section 5.5(a), Sellers and Purchaser shall each use
their commercially reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements so as to enable the Closing to occur
as soon as reasonably possible. In furtherance of the foregoing, Purchaser
and its Affiliates shall, if necessary or desirable to obtain any required
approvals, (A) enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or
decree or file appropriate applications with Antitrust Agencies, or (B)
contest and resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or
judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any applicable antitrust
law, provided however that Purchaser shall not be required to take any action
that results in a material adverse impact on the value of the Business. From
the date of this Agreement through the date of termination of the required
waiting period under the HSR Act, Purchaser shall not make any acquisition or
agree to make any acquisition or enter into or agree to enter into any joint
venture or similar arrangement that could reasonably be expected to hinder or
delay the obtaining of clearance or the expiration of the required waiting
period under the HSR Act or any other applicable foreign antitrust Law.

 

 

5.6 Further Action. Sellers and Purchaser shall use their
respective commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions (within their respective control) necessary or appropriate
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, from time to time after the Closing
Date, and for no further consideration, Sellers and Purchaser shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver such assignments, transfers, consents, assumptions
and other documents and instruments and take such other actions as may
reasonably be necessary to appropriately consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including (i) transferring back to Honeywell or any
Seller or its designated Subsidiaries any asset or liability which was not
contemplated by this Agreement to be transferred to Purchaser at the Closing
but was so transferred at the Closing, (ii) transferring to Purchaser any
asset or liability contemplated by this Agreement to be transferred to
Purchaser and which was not so transferred at the Closing, and (iii)
remitting promptly to Honeywell, any Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be,
any cash amounts prior to the Closing Date, in the case of Honeywell or any
Seller or Transferred Entity, or on or after the Closing Date, in the case of
Purchaser. To the extent there are any Contracts under which benefits accrue
to both the Business and to other businesses of the Sellers, the Sellers and
Purchaser shall use their respective commercially reasonable best efforts to
continue to cause the benefits (and related Liabilities) to be available to
the Business or such other businesses in the same manner after the Closing.
To the extent that a Contract that was transferred to Purchaser at Closing as
a Purchased Asset is necessary to the Sellers' operation of other businesses
in addition to the Business, Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate in good
faith to make available to Sellers the benefits that were necessary to
conduct such other businesses prior to the Closing (and related Liabilities)
to be available to Sellers in the same manner after the Closing at prices
consistent with historical practice of the Business.

5.7 Expenses. Except as expressly set forth herein, whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party hereto incurring such expenses. Except for
any VAT payable on the sale of the Purchased Assets relating to the UK
Business which shall be governed by Section 5.15(h), all transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement (all
such items so incurred (other than VAT governed by Section 5.15(h)) are
referred to herein collectively as "Transfer Taxes"), shall be borne 50% by
Purchaser and 50% by Sellers. All necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes shall be filed by the
party which is primarily liable for the payment of such Transfer Taxes to the
relevant Taxing Authority under applicable Law, or in cases where
neither party is so liable, then the Purchaser. Sellers and Purchaser
shall cooperate with each other and take actions reasonably requested by the
other to permit Transfer Taxes to be paid, and any related Tax Returns to be
filed, on a timely basis.

 

 

5.8 Employees and Employee Benefit Plans. This Section 5.8 contains the
covenants and agreements of the parties with respect to (i) the status of
employment of the employees of Sellers, the Transferred Entities and any
Affiliates of the Sellers or Transferred Entities, in each case to the extent
employed in the Business as of the Closing Date other than Retained Employees
("Employees"), upon the sale of the Business to Purchaser, and (ii) the
employee benefits and employee benefit plans provided or covering such
Employees and former employees of the Transferred Entities who terminated
employment with the Transferred Entities while employed in the Business or
who retired from the Business prior to the Closing Date
("Former Employees").

 

 

(a) United States Employees. This Section 5.8(a) applies to Employees
employed as of the Closing Date in the United States Business.

 

 

(i) Continuation of Employment; Assumption of Current Liabilities for
Employees. Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause
an Affiliate to, offer employment to all salaried and hourly persons who are
designated on the records of Sellers as of the Closing Date as Employees with
respect to the United States Business, if then actively at work, or on
vacation leave, leave of absence, sick leave, short-term (but not long-term)
disability leave. Such Employees accepting Purchaser's or its Affiliate's
offer will become "Transferred US Employees" as of the Effective Time. For
those Employees who would otherwise be required to receive offers of
employment pursuant to this Section 5.8(a)(i) but who are receiving long-
term disability benefits as of the Effective Time, Purchaser shall, or shall
cause its Affiliate to, offer employment to each such US Employee to the
extent he recovers from his disability and presents himself to Purchaser or
such Affiliate for active employment within six months of the Closing Date.
Each Employee described in the preceding sentence who accepts Purchaser's (or
its Affiliate's) offer will become a Transferred US Employee as of the date
he returns to work with the Purchaser or its Affiliate. Terms of employment
continuation for each Transferred US Employee shall (A) be at the same work
location, (B) pay a base wage rate no less than each such Transferred US
Employee's base wage rate in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date,
(C) provide an incentive compensation opportunity no less than each such
Transferred US Employee's incentive compensation opportunity in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date for the balance of the year in which
the Closing Date occurs and thereafter 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

such incentive compensation opportunity, if any, as is provided to similarly
situated employees of Purchaser and its Affiliates, and (D) as of the time
the Employees become Transferred US Employees, provide retirement and welfare
benefits that are the same as those provided to similarly situated employees
of the Purchaser and its Affiliates ("Purchaser's U.S. Benefit Plans"). The
terms and conditions of employment and total compensation and employees
benefits of the Transferred US Employees as of the Closing Date shall be, in
the aggregate, reasonably comparable to those provided by Sellers immediately
prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall credit, or shall cause its
Affiliates to credit, each Transferred US Employee's service with Sellers,
the Transferred Entities and their respective Affiliates for purposes of
eligibility, participation and vesting , but not (except as expressly
otherwise provided herein) benefit accrual. Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall honor any re-employment rights mandated by applicable Law or by
contract of any Employees. Purchaser shall likewise honor and assume all
liability for accrued wages, earned but unused current year
vacation benefits, entitlements to tuition reimbursements approved, subject
to applicable conditions, prior to Closing for courses and programs of study
completed after Closing, and bonus entitlement for the portion of the year or
performance period ending on the Closing Date for all Transferred US
Employees. Nothing in this Agreement shall, or shall be construed to, limit
the ability of the Purchaser to terminate the employment of any Transferred
US Employee at any time after the Closing Date.

 

 

(ii) Severance Protection. If Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
terminates the employment of any Transferred US Employee on or before the
first anniversary of the Closing Date (including, but not limited to, the
termination of any Transferred US Employee because he refuses to accept a
work relocation that is greater than fifty (50) miles from his work location
as of the Closing Date), Purchaser or its Affiliate shall provide a severance
benefit consisting of notice pay, salary continuation and continued insurance
coverage that shall be no less than the severance benefit the Transferred US
Employee would have received under the terms of a Seller's, or a Transferred
Entity's severance plan(s), as applicable, in effect on the Closing Date,
calculated as though the Transferred US Employee worked continuously (by
combining such Transferred US Employee's service for Sellers and the
Transferred Entities and their Affiliates on the one hand, and Purchaser and
its Affiliates on the other hand) until his termination date with Purchaser
or its Affiliate. Following the twelve month period after the Closing Date,
Transferred US Employees shall be entitled to the benefit of such severance
plan, policy or practice generally applicable to similarly situated employees
of the Purchaser or its Affiliates in effect as of a Transferred Employees
date of employment termination; provided that service with Sellers, the
Transferred Entities, Purchaser, and their respective Affiliates shall be
taken into account in computing the amount of such benefit.

 

 

(iii) Cooperation. The United States Business agrees to use reasonable
efforts to facilitate the transition of Transferred US Employees to
employment with Purchaser or its Affiliate as of the Effective Time or such
later time as may be required by Section 5.8(a)(i).

 

 

(iv) Savings Plan and Pension Plan.

 

 

(A) Savings Plan. Effective as of the time the Employees become Transferred
US Employees, Transferred US Employees shall cease to be eligible
to contribute to the Honeywell Savings and Ownership Plan ("Sellers'
Savings Plan"). Effective as of the Closing Date (the "Savings Plan
Commencement Date"), Purchaser shall maintain,

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

40  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

one or more tax-qualified defined contribution savings plans ("Purchaser's
Savings Plans") that shall (i) permit immediate participation as of the
Savings Plan Commencement Date for the Transferred US Employees who were
eligible to participate in Sellers' Savings Plan as of the day before the
Closing Date; (ii) credit all service that was credited under Sellers'
Savings Plan for purposes of the eligibility, vesting and match eligibility
requirements of the Purchaser's Savings Plans; and (iii) provide for tax-
deferred contributions pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser's Savings Plan shall not be required
to offer participation to any Transferred US Employee prior to the date he
becomes a Transferred US Employee.

 

 

(B) Pension Plans. Effective as of the time the Employees become Transferred
US Employees, Transferred US Employees shall no longer be eligible to accrue
benefits under any defined benefit pension plan sponsored by a
Seller ("Sellers' Pension Plan"). Sellers shall retain all assets and
liabilities related to Sellers' Pension Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
but subject to Section 5.8(a)(i), Purchaser and its Affiliates shall have no
obligation to establish a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan for
Transferred US Employees.

 

 

(v) Employee Welfare Plans. Purchaser or its Affiliates shall, not later than
(i) the Closing Date or (ii) such later date on or before December 31, 2008,
as defined and agreed to in the Transition Services Agreement for each
specific administrative service or employee benefit plan (the "Benefit
Transition Date"), provide the Transferred US Employees and their
beneficiaries with medical and life insurance, disability, severance,
vacation and other welfare benefit plans and programs as Purchaser or its
Affiliates shall determine, subject to the requirements of this Section
5.8; provided, however, that except as provided herein, Sellers shall remain
solely responsible for liabilities or obligations incurred with respect to
each Transferred US Employee or Former Employee and their spouses, dependents
and beneficiaries under any of Sellers' medical and life insurance,
disability, severance, vacation and other welfare benefit plans and programs
for liabilities or obligations incurred prior to the Closing Date; and
provided further, that subject to any specific provision of this Section 5.8
to the contrary, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be solely responsible
for liabilities or obligations incurred with respect to each Transferred US
Employee and their spouses, dependents and beneficiaries under any of
Sellers\', Purchaser's, or any Transferred Entity's medical and life
insurance, disability, severance, vacation and other welfare benefit plans
and programs for liabilities incurred on or after the Closing Date. For
purposes of this Section 5.8(a)(v), a liability or obligation shall be deemed
to be incurred upon the occurrence of an injury or the diagnosis of an
illness and the liability or obligation will include any covered expenses for
any related claims or series of related claims giving rise to such liability
or obligation, provided that in the case of medical and dental expense being
submitted for claim under any flexible spending account plan, a liability or
obligation shall be deemed to be incurred only as and when claim for payment
of the same is received. Any plans or programs established or maintained by
Purchaser or its Affiliates to provide medical and life insurance,
disability, cafeteria, flexible spending, dependent care and other similar
welfare benefits for the benefit of the Transferred US Employees shall, (i)
waive any pre-existing condition limitation or exclusion or any actively-at-
work requirement, (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible, copayment
and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid
by, and amounts reimbursed to, such Employees with respect to similar plans
maintained by the Seller and the Transferred Entities and (iii) recognize
credited

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

service with the Seller and the Transferred Entities for the purposes of
eligibility and participation. The foregoing shall not require the Purchaser
or its Affiliates to establish, continue, or refrain from modifying any
particular plan or program, the establishment, continuation or modification
of which shall be in the sole discretion of Purchaser or its Affiliates.

 

 

(vi) Severance and WARN Act Liability. Purchaser agrees to pay and be
responsible for (i) all liability, cost or expense for severance, salary
continuation, special bonuses and like costs under Purchaser's severance pay
policies or practices, retention agreements, policies or arrangements and
(ii) any payment obligations described in Section 5.8(a)(ii) with respect to
any of the Transferred US Employees that arise on or after the Closing Date.
Except for Purchaser's payment obligations assumed by the Purchaser pursuant
to Section 5.8(a)(i), Sellers agree to pay and be responsible for all
liability, cost or expense, if any, for severance, salary continuation,
special bonuses and the like under Sellers' severance pay plans, retention
agreements, employment agreements, policies or arrangements with respect to
any of the U.S. Employees that arise before the Closing Date in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the termination of employment of any such Employee by a Seller. Purchaser
agrees to pay and be responsible for all liability, cost, expense and
sanctions resulting from any failure to comply with the WARN Act, and the
regulations thereunder, in connection with events which occur on or after the
Closing Date that relate to the Business. No more than three (3) business
days prior to the Closing Date, Section 3.12(h) of the Disclosure Schedule
shall be updated as of such date and delivered to Purchaser.

 

 

(vii) Worker's Compensation. Purchaser shall be responsible for
the administration and the financial obligation of all worker's compensation
claims with respect to the Transferred US Employees arising out of or
relating to occurrences on or after the Closing Date and Sellers shall be
responsible for the administration and the financial obligation of all
worker's compensation claims arising out of or relating to occurrences before
the Closing Date; provided, however, that the following specific principles
shall apply to the following claims:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

42  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(A) Modified Duty. If, prior to the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, Purchaser fails to continue to accommodate the modified or alternative
work arrangements that are currently in place for each of the Transferred
US Employees set forth on Section 5.8(viii)(A) of the Disclosure Schedule
(the "Modified Duty Employees"), except if such failure to accommodate is the
result of a termination of such Modified Duty Employee's employment for
cause, then Sellers and the Purchaser shall share the applicable worker's
compensation liability, as determined by the applicable worker's compensation
state Law, in proportion to the length of time such Modified Duty Employee
was on modified duty with a Seller or Transferred Entity before the Closing
Date and Purchaser after the Closing Date. If such failure to accommodate
described in the preceding sentence occurs with respect to a Modified Duty
Employee following the first anniversary of the Closing Date or if a Modified
Duty Employee voluntarily leaves employment at any time for any reason other
than an unjustified failure by Purchaser to accommodate, then Sellers shall
bear all applicable worker's compensation liability with respect to such
Modified Duty Employee and Purchaser shall not share any of such liability
with Sellers.

 

 

(B) Aggravated Injury. In the event that a Transferred US Employee
notifies Purchaser after the Closing Date of a worker's compensation injury
that is the result of an aggravation of an injury that occurred prior to the
Closing Date, the responsibility for the administration and financial
obligation of this claim (i.e., the allocation between Sellers' worker's
compensation coverage and Purchaser's worker's compensation coverage) will be
determined by the applicable worker's compensation Law and is subject to the
final interpretation of the appropriate court.

 

 

(viii) No Assumption of U.S. Benefit Plans. Neither Purchaser nor its
Affiliates nor any Transferred Entity shall assume any U.S. Benefit Plan.
Prior to the Closing, to the extent Honeywell deems necessary, Sellers and
the Transferred Entities shall cause each Transferred Entity to (i) withdraw
from or otherwise terminate its participation under each U.S. Benefit Plan,
or (ii) if any U.S. Benefit Plan is maintained or sponsored solely by one or
more Transferred Entities, terminate such plan, with such withdrawal or
termination of participation or plan termination effective no later than the
Benefit Transition Date in the case of plans described in clause (i) and no
later than the Closing Date in the case of plans described in clause (ii).

 

 

(ix) Vacation. Effective with the date an Employee becomes a Transferred US
Employee, Purchaser shall assume liability for any earned but not taken
vacation time (with the exception of any grandfathered vacation bank) of the
Transferred US Employee. Purchaser shall provide Transferred US Employees
with a vacation entitlement that is no less favorable than the entitlement
they had immediately prior to the Closing for the period between the Closing
and December 31, 2008, and thereafter vacation accrual not less favorable
than that provided other similarly situated employees of Purchaser taking
into account, to the extent relevant, service with Sellers, the Transferred
Entities, Purchaser, and their respective Affiliates in computing the amount
of such accrual. Effective with the date an Employee becomes a
Transferred Employee, Seller shall pay in full the value of any grandfathered
vacation bank to the Transferred US Employee.

 

 

(x)   Flexible Spending Accounts. Effective as of the Benefit Transition
Date, Transferred US Employees shall no longer be eligible to contribute to
the health care

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

flexible spending account or accounts sponsored by Sellers except as
otherwise provided by and in accordance with COBRA. Effective as of the
Benefit Transition Date, the Transferred US Employees shall no longer be
eligible to contribute to the dependent care flexible spending accounts
sponsored by Sellers (such health and dependent care accounts,
"Sellers' FSAs"). Effective as of the Benefit Transition Date,
Purchaser shall establish, modify, or otherwise maintain, or shall cause its
Affiliate to establish or maintain, health care and dependent care flexible
spending accounts ("Purchaser's FSAs") which shall (i) permit immediate
participation as of the Benefit Transition Date for all Transferred US
Employees who were participating in Sellers' FSAs as of the day before the
Benefit Transition Date, (ii) allow elections of such Transferred US
Employees for the plan year beginning before but ending after the Benefit
Transition Date, if any, to be honored in full and (iii) accept
for reimbursement any claims related to any such plan year and eligible
for reimbursement on the basis of participant elections initially made
under Sellers\' FSAs for such plan year.

 

 

(b) Non-US Employees. This Section 5.8(b) applies only to Employees or
Former Employees employed as of the Closing Date by, or who terminated
employment the Transferred Entities while employed in, the Non-United States
Business.

 

 

(i) Employment. Each Employee employed by Sellers, the Transferred Entities
or any Affiliate in the Non-United States Business, whether hourly or
salaried, and who is actively at work on the Closing Date, or who is absent
on the Closing Date due to vacation or holiday leave, whether paid or unpaid,
shall be referred to as a "Non-US Employee." Wherever legally permissible, on
the Closing Date, Non-US Employees shall become employees of Purchaser or
continue to be employees of a Transferred Entity by operation of the
applicable Laws or regulations of the jurisdiction in which such employment
is located (the "National Laws", which term shall include local laws
implementing EU Directive 2001/23/EC, where applicable) and/or pursuant to
the terms of any necessary transfer agreement relating to that jurisdiction.
Where such continuation of employment or transfer is not possible in the
manner described in the previous sentence, Purchaser shall offer the Non-US
Employees employment in accordance with the procedures required by applicable
National Laws to effectuate their employment with Purchaser or a Transferred
Entity commencing on the Closing Date. Each Non-US Employee who, as of the
Closing Date, is employed by, or otherwise has his employment continued with,
a Transferred Entity, or who otherwise transfers to the employ of Purchaser
or a Transferred Entity pursuant to National Laws or accepts Purchaser's
offer of employment shall be referred to as a "Transferred Non-US Employee."
No provision herein shall impair, deny or limit the right of Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates to change the employment terms or to terminate the
employment of any Transferred Non-US Employee at any time, to the extent
permissible under applicable National Laws.

 

 

(ii) Compensation and Benefits. Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser
or its Affiliates shall provide Transferred Non-US Employees with the same
compensation and other terms and conditions of employment and provide
benefits that are comparable in the aggregate in terms of value to the
employee to the terms and conditions of employment and level of total
compensation and employee benefits that are (i) provided under the
Transferred Non-US Employee's employment contract immediately prior to the
Closing Date, if applicable, or (ii) if more favorable than the level of
compensation and the terms and conditions described in clause (i), required
by applicable National Laws.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) Foreign Benefit Plans. "Sellers' Foreign Benefit Plans" means those
Foreign Benefit Plans listed on Section 3.12(b) of the Disclosure Schedule to
the extent they cover the Transferred Non-US Employees.

 

 

(A) Except to the extent otherwise required by Law or pursuant to
Section 5.8(b)(iii)(B), as of the Closing Date, each Transferred Non-US
Employee shall cease to be an active participant in Sellers' Foreign Benefit
Plans which are not Transferred Foreign Benefit Plans as defined in
subparagraph (B) below.

 

 

(B) As of the Benefit Transition Date, Purchaser or its Affiliates shall
establish or maintain employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements
outside of the United States in accordance with Section 5.8(b)(ii) of this
Agreement and applicable National Laws that (1) provide benefits that are
comparable in the aggregate to the level of employee benefits that
are provided under the Transferred Non-US Employee's employment contract
immediately prior to the Closing Date, if applicable, or (2) if more
favorable than the level of employee benefits described in subclause (1),
provide a level of employee benefits that are required by applicable National
Laws (collectively, "Purchaser's Foreign Benefit Plans"). Sellers will take
such steps as are necessary to ensure that those of Sellers' Foreign Benefit
Plans and Sellers' insurance contracts providing benefits that are maintained
exclusively for the benefit of employees of a Transferred Entity who become
on the Closing Date Transferred Non-US Employees (inclusive of applicable
assets, insurance contracts, property or funds underlying, supporting or
otherwise to be used or applied to fund or pay benefits or liabilities under
or with respect to such plans) as set forth on Section 5.8(b)(iii) of the
Disclosure Schedule (the "Transferred Foreign Benefit Plans"), will be
transferred or assigned to Purchaser or its Affiliates (or, in the case of
such assets, property or funds, to the applicable plan or plans so
established or maintained) no later than the Benefit Transition Date. With
respect to any Sellers' Foreign Benefit Plans that are not transferred to
Purchaser as provided in the preceding sentence and to the extent not
otherwise required by Law, Sellers and the Transferred Entities shall
cause each Transferred Entity to (x) withdraw from or otherwise terminate
its participation under such Foreign Benefits Plans or, (y) if any such
Sellers' Foreign Benefits Plan is maintained or sponsored solely by one or
more Transferred Entities, terminate such plan, with such withdrawal or
termination of participation or plan termination effective no later than the
Benefit Transition Date in the case of plans described in clause (x) and no
later than the Closing Date in the case of plans described in clause (y).

 

 

(C) Other than those employees who will receive severance benefits pursuant
to Section 5.8(b)(iii)(D), Purchaser shall provide each Transferred Non-US
Employee with full credit for service with Sellers or the applicable
Transferred Entity and Purchaser for purposes of eligibility to participate,
and vesting and solely with respect to those Sellers' Foreign Benefit Plans
(inclusive of related asset, contracts, property and funds) that are
transferred or assigned to Purchaser, benefit accrual under Purchaser's Non-
US Employee Benefits Plans.

 

 

(D) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be obligated to
recognize prior service with Sellers as otherwise required by
Section 5.8(b)(iii)(C), in the case of each Transferred Non-U.S.
Employee employed in the countries listed in

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 5.8(b)(iii)(D) of the Disclosure Schedule.1 In respect of such
Transferred Non-U.S. Employees Purchaser shall directly reimburse the Seller
at the Closing Date the total severance amount set out in Section
5.8(b)(iii)(D) of the Disclosure Schedule or, if greater, any severance
required by applicable National Laws.

 

 

(E) No provision herein shall impair Purchaser's ability to amend or
terminate any such plan at any time to the extent permissible under
applicable National Law.

 

 

(iv) Termination and Severance Liabilities. Purchaser shall be responsible
for any amounts becoming payable to Transferred Non-US Employees under
applicable National Laws, Purchaser's severance plans or arrangements or any
employment contracts as a result of their being dismissed by Purchaser or a
Transferred Entity at any time on or after the Closing Date, notwithstanding
that such amount is calculated under applicable National Laws, plan,
arrangement or employment contract by reference to periods of employment with
Sellers or Transferred Entities as well as periods of employment with
Purchaser.

 

 

(v) Responsibility for Non-US Employees. Except as otherwise set forth herein
Purchaser shall assume and thereafter pay, perform and discharge any and all
employment, compensation and employee benefit liabilities, responsibilities
and obligations with respect to Transferred Non-US Employees, including any
and all claims under National Laws, which liabilities, responsibilities and
obligations are incurred as the result of incidents, events, acts or failures
to act, occurring on or after the Closing Date.

 

 

(vi) Employee Refusal to Transfer. Any Non-US Employee lawfully rejecting the
transfer to or employment by Purchaser or its Affiliates shall, except as
otherwise required by National Laws, remain employed by Sellers; provided,
however, that Sellers may terminate such Non-US Employee immediately after
Closing, subject to applicable legal constraints, if any, and shall be solely
responsible for any severance payment or compensation or other benefit to or
with respect to such Non-US Employee. Purchaser shall be responsible for all
costs with respect to such terminations to the extent such costs arise as a
result of Purchaser's failure to comply with the obligations set forth in
Sections 5.8(b)(i), (ii) and (iii).

 

 

(vii) Non-US Employee Communications. Each party to this Agreement shall
comply with all obligations under applicable National Laws to provide
information to the other parties for onward transmission to Non-US Employees
or their representatives and/or to provide such information directly to the
Non-US Employees or their representatives. Each party to this
Agreement shall comply with all obligations under applicable National Law to
inform and/or consult trade unions, works councils or other employee
representative bodies in connection with the matters contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 

(c) Leased Employees. Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall take steps
to enter into an agreement with the provider of subcontract employees to the
Business to enable

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the transfer of such subcontract employees from the related contract of the
Seller to a contract of the Purchaser as of the Closing Date. Seller
will cooperate with Purchaser to affect this transfer.

 

 

5.9 Intercompany Accounts. Prior to Closing, the Sellers will use
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause any amounts related to the
Business owed to or by a Seller or Transferred Entity from or to Sellers or
other divisions or Affiliates of Sellers to be settled.

 

 

5.10 Non-Solicitation of Employees. Honeywell agrees that from the date
hereof through the third anniversary of the Closing Date, without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, it will not, directly or indirectly, solicit
for employment any Transferred Employee (other than clerical or non-salaried
employees) or employ any of the Transferred Employees set forth on Schedule
5.10; provided, however, the foregoing shall not prohibit Honeywell from (a)
engaging in the general solicitation (whether by newspaper, trade publication
or other periodical or pursuant to the use of an executive search consultant)
of employees (or hiring any employees that respond to such general
solicitation) so long as such solicitation is not directed specifically at
employees of the Business, (b) soliciting or hiring any such employee (other
than clerical or non-salaried employees) who has not been employed by
Purchaser during the three-month period preceding such solicitation or who
was involuntarily terminated by Purchaser, (c) employing its Employees
through the Closing Date or (d) employing the Retained Employees after the
Closing Date. Purchaser agrees that for the same period and subject to the
same exceptions, it will not, directly or indirectly, solicit any Retained
Employee or any other Employee who does not become a Transferred US Employee
or a Transferred Non-US Employee (other than clerical or non-salaried
employees).

 

 

5.11 Non-Competition.

 

 

(a) For a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date, each Seller agrees
that it will not, and each will cause its controlled Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, engage in the distribution, marketing or selling of
Products or providing related inventory management and warehousing services
with respect to the Products, in each case to third party customers in the
aerospace industry (a "Competing Business"); provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 5.11 shall be deemed to limit in any way the conduct
of the Excluded Business or the provision of inventory management or
warehousing services to third party customers that include Products in
addition to other products or services (provided that the Products are
provided to such third party customer pursuant to the Supply Agreement) and
such activities and businesses shall be excluded from the definition of
Competing Business for all purposes related to this Agreement. The
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.11(a) shall not be construed to
prohibit or restrict any Seller or any of its controlled Affiliates from
acquiring any Person or business that engages in any Competing Business
provided that (i) the engagement in such Competing Business does not
constitute the principal part of the activities of the Person or business to
be acquired (based on total revenues expressed in US dollars or calculated in
US dollars utilizing the relevant and then applicable current foreign
currency exchange rate, of all sales of such Person or business during the
consecutive four (4) full calendar quarters immediately preceding
the effective date of acquisition of such Person or business), or (ii) if
the Competing Business constitutes in excess of 20% of the revenues of the
Person or business acquired, or the revenues of such Competing Business are
in excess of $50,000,000 per year, Sellers (A) promptly provide written
notice to Purchaser after its acquisition of the Competing Business (the
"Acquisition

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Notice") and (B) subject to Section 5.11(b), use their commercially
reasonable best efforts to divest that portion of such Person or business
that engages in the Competing Business within 12 months after the later of
its acquisition of the Competing Business or the expiration of any effort to
sell the Competing Business to the Purchaser under Section 5.11(b).
Notwithstanding this Section 5.11(a), if the exclusivity provisions of the
Supply Agreement or the Intellectual Property License Agreement are suspended
or terminated before the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, Honeywell or
any Seller may engage in any activity necessary to replace the services
performed by Purchaser under the Supply Agreement or Intellectual Property
License Agreement during such suspension or after such termination.

 

 

(b) In the event that Sellers are required to divest any Competing Business
pursuant to Section 5.11(a), the Acquisition Notice shall constitute an
exclusive offer by Sellers to sell such Competing Business to Purchaser at
Fair Market Value. Such offer shall remain open and irrevocable until the
expiration of 20 Business Days after receipt of such Acquisition Notice (the
"Offer Period"). At any time prior to expiration of the Offer Period,
Purchaser shall have the right to accept Sellers' offer by delivering a
written notice to Sellers (the "Acceptance Notice"). If Purchaser delivers
the Acceptance Notice during the Offer Period, Sellers shall sell the
Competing Business to Purchaser at the Fair Market Value on mutually
acceptable terms, which terms shall be negotiated in good faith. In the event
that (i) Purchaser shall have received an Acquisition Notice from Sellers but
Sellers shall not have received an Acceptance Notice prior to expiration of
the Offer Period or (ii) Purchaser shall have given an Acceptance Notice to
Sellers but shall have failed to purchase the Competing Business within the
time frame specified in Section 5.11(a), then nothing in this Section
5.11(b) shall limit the right of Sellers thereafter to sell the Competing
Business to a third party. For purposes of this Section 5.11, "Fair Market
Value" of the Competing Business shall mean the cash price that an
unaffiliated third party would pay to acquire such Competing Business in an
arm's-length transaction, assuming the Sellers are not compelled to divest
the Competing Business. To determine the Fair Market Value of such
Competing Business, Honeywell and Purchaser shall agree on and designate an
investment banking firm of recognized international standing (the "Investment
Banking Firm"). The Investment Banking Firm, within 30 days after
appointment, shall deliver its final view as to the Fair Market Value of the
Competing Business to Honeywell and Purchaser and such final view shall
be the price to be paid by the Purchaser for such Competing Business if
Purchaser elects to purchase such Competing Business pursuant to
Section 5.11(b). Each party shall have the opportunity to share
any materials with the Investment Banking Firm containing information
regarding the potential Fair Market Value within 21 days after appointment.
The Investment Banking Firm shall employ generally accepted valuation
methodologies including reviewing precedent transactions in which sellers
were not compelled to sell. The Investment Banking Firm shall, among other
things, also take into account the value of any applicable tax benefit
accruing to the Buyer (if any) as a result of the Transaction as determined
by the Investment Banking Firm. The costs and expenses of the Investment
Banking Firm shall be shared equally by Honeywell and the Purchaser.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
prohibitions in Section 5.11(a) shall not apply to (i) any businesses or
operations of Sellers or any of their Subsidiaries which are transferred to
any third party after the date hereof, (ii) any Subsidiaries of any Seller
the stock of which is transferred to any third party after the date hereof,
(iii) any Affiliate of Sellers who becomes an Affiliate as a result of a
change of control of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Honeywell or (iv) any acquisition of securities by any Seller's pension trust
or similar employee benefit plan investment vehicle, provided that any
securities acquired shall be held for investment purposes only and such
benefit plans comply with the ERISA requirements as to the independence of
investment decisions.

 

 

(d) Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that the remedy at law for any
breach, or threatened breach, of any of the provisions of this Section 5.11
may be inadequate and, accordingly, each Seller covenants and agrees that
Purchaser shall, in addition to any other rights and remedies which Purchaser
may have at Law, be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive
relief, and to the remedy of specific performance with respect to any breach
or threatened breach of the provisions of this Section 5.11, as may be
available from any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post
bond or any other security. In addition, Sellers and Purchaser agree that the
provisions of this Section 5.11 are fair and reasonable in light of
Purchaser's plans for the Business and are necessary to accomplish the full
transfer of the goodwill and other intangible assets contemplated hereby. In
the event that any of the provisions of this Section 5.11 shall be
determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any
reason whatsoever, then all other provisions of this Section 5.11 shall
remain in full force and effect, and the parties hereto agree that
such unenforceable provision may be modified by the court so as to comply
with applicable Law and that the provisions of this Section 5.11 shall be
amended in accordance with said modification.

 

 

5.12 Confidential Information. Each Seller hereby agrees that for a period
of five (5) years from the Closing Date it shall hold, and shall cause
its controlled Affiliates to hold and maintain the confidentiality of
all information relating to trade secrets, processes, patent applications,
product development, price, customer and supplier lists, pricing and
marketing plans, policies and strategies, details of client and consultant
contracts, operations methods, product development techniques, business
acquisition plans, new personnel acquisition plans and all other confidential
or proprietary information concerning the Business or the Purchased Assets
(the "Confidential Information"), and shall not use for the benefit of
themselves or others, or disclose or cause or permit to be used or disclosed
any of the Confidential Information for any reason or purpose whatsoever,
except and to the extent any disclosure of Confidential Information is
required by Law or appropriate court order and sufficient advance written
notice thereof, if reasonably practicable, is provided to Purchaser to permit
Purchaser to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, provided,
however, that the term "Confidential Information" shall not include
information that (i) does not relate primarily to the Business, (ii) relates
to any Retained Asset, Retained Liability, the Excluded Business or, if
applicable, the Retained Interests, (iii) becomes available to any Seller or
any of its Affiliates on a non-confidential basis from a source other than
Purchaser, (iv) is independently developed by any Seller, any of its
Affiliates or their respective employees under circumstances not involving a
breach of this Section 5.12, (v) is publicly disclosed pursuant to a lawful
requirement or request from a Governmental Authority acting within its
jurisdiction, or non-confidential disclosure is otherwise required by Law
after any Seller or any of its Affiliates has exercised its commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will
be accorded to such information, (vi) is publicly available as of the date of
this Agreement, or which becomes publicly available after the date of this
Agreement through no fault of any Seller or its Affiliates, (vii) disclosed
on a confidential basis to Sellers' attorneys, accountants, lenders and
investment bankers, or (viii) disclosed or used by Sellers or any of their
Affiliates to protect or enforce their

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights or perform their obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, in connection with tax or other regulatory filings, litigation,
financial reporting or other reasonable business purposes, or the conduct of
their own businesses if, and to the extent, not otherwise prohibited by
Section 5.11. The provisions of this Section 5.12 shall expire on the fifth
anniversary of the Closing, provided, however, that if either the Supply
Agreement or the Intellectual Property License Agreement is suspended or
terminated before the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, Sellers and
their controlled Affiliates may use such Confidential Information to the
extent necessary to procure alternative supply arrangements during
such suspension or after such termination.

 

 

5.13 Payments Received. Sellers and Purchaser agree that, after the
Closing Date, they shall hold and shall promptly transfer and deliver to the
other party, from time to time as and when received by it and in the
currency received, any cash, checks with appropriate endorsements (using
commercially reasonable efforts not to convert such checks into cash), or
other property that they may receive after the date hereof which property
belongs to the other party, including any payments of accounts receivable and
insurance proceeds, and shall account to the other party for all such
receipts.

 

 

5.14 Sellers' Marks.

 

 

(a) Except as expressly set forth herein and subject to the
Intellectual Property License Agreement, Purchaser, each of its Affiliates
and its and their respective directors, officers, successors, assigns,
agents, or representatives shall not register, or attempt to register, and
shall not directly or indirectly use, in any fashion, including in signage,
corporate letterhead, business cards, internet websites, marketing material
and the like, or seek to register or own, in connection with any products or
services anywhere in the world in any medium, any Trademarks, trade names or
domain names that include, are identical to or are confusingly similar to the
HONEYWELL mark or any derivation therefrom or any corporate symbols or logos
incorporating "HONEYWELL" either alone or in combinations or any goodwill
represented thereby and pertaining thereto.

 

 

(b) Subject to the restrictions set forth herein, Honeywell hereby grants to
Purchaser effective as of the Closing Date, a personal, nonexclusive,
royalty-free transition license for twelve (12) months after the Closing Date
(the "TM License Term") to use the HONEYWELL mark and Honeywell red logo
(collectively, "Sellers' Marks" in the same manner as used by Sellers prior
to the Closing Date: (i) on existing signage, marketing materials and other
materials, in each case included in the Purchased Assets as of the Closing
Date and (ii) in the Inventory. Purchaser shall in any event phase out such
use of the Sellers' Marks as soon as is reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date. Such limited transition license shall terminate twelve (12)
months after the Closing Date regardless of whether or not inventory branded
with any Sellers' Marks remains in inventory of Purchaser. Purchaser may only
use the Sellers' Marks on materials in existence as of the Closing Date and
may not create any materials of any kind using the Sellers' Marks. All use of
the Sellers' Marks as permitted hereunder shall inure to the benefit of
Honeywell.

 

 

(c) The Sellers' Marks are the sole and exclusive property of Honeywell.
Purchaser shall not acquire any right, title or interest, express or implied,
in the Sellers' Marks

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and its use, individually or collectively. Purchaser shall not knowingly
at any time, either during the life of or after expiration of this
Agreement, contest the validity of the Sellers' Marks or Honeywell's rights
therein, or assert or claim any other right to manufacture, sell or offer for
sale products or services under the Sellers' Marks, or any trademark
confusingly similar thereto or knowingly assist any third party in such
activities.

 

 

(d) During the TM License Term, Purchaser shall conduct its business in a
dignified manner consistent with the general reputation and importance
of Honeywell. During the TM License Term, Purchaser shall use reasonable and
good faith commercial efforts to safeguard the established
goodwill symbolized by the Sellers' Marks and to maintain the quality and
performance standards of its sale and provision of the Inventory. During the
TM License Term, Purchaser shall not take any action or omit to take any
action which may reasonably be expected to derogate, erode or tarnish the
Sellers' Marks, or otherwise diminish the value of the Sellers' Marks.

 

 

(e) The rights granted to Purchaser in this Section are personal to Purchaser
and may not be assigned or sublicensed, by operation of law or otherwise, nor
may Purchaser delegate its obligations hereunder without the written consent
of Honeywell.

 

 

5.15 Tax Matters.

 

 

(a) Pre-Closing Taxes. Sellers will prepare and timely file, or cause to
be prepared and timely filed, (i) all Tax Returns of Sellers that include
the Business or the Purchased Assets for all Tax periods (or portions
thereof) ending on or prior to the day before the Closing Date and (ii) all
Tax Returns of the Transferred Entities for any Tax period ending on or prior
to the Closing Date, and shall pay all Taxes due for such Tax periods,
including additional Taxes assessed after any subsequent Tax audit.

 

 

(b) Post-Closing and Straddle Period Taxes. Purchaser will prepare and timely
file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns that are
required to be filed in respect of the Purchased Assets, the Business and the
Transferred Entities for Tax periods ending after the Closing Date, including
Straddle Periods; for avoidance of doubt, such Tax Returns prepared by
Purchaser in respect of Purchased Assets and the Business shall reflect only
operations of the Business on and after the Closing Date (except for Tax
Returns of Transferred Entities for Straddle Periods, which shall reflect
operations of the Business both before and after the Closing Date, and the
Taxes shown on which shall be allocated between Purchaser and Seller as
provided below). Any such Tax Return that relates to a Straddle Period shall
be provided to Sellers for review and comment at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the applicable filing date taking into account validly obtained
extensions. Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes due for such
Tax periods, provided, however, that in the case of a Tax Return that relates
to a Straddle Period, the Seller shall pay to Purchaser at least five (5)
prior to the date on which Taxes are due with respect to such Straddle Period
an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on the day before the Closing Date. For purposes
of this Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are payable for a taxable
period that includes (but does not end on) the day before the Closing Date,
the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such taxable period
ending on the day before the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any real
and personal property Taxes or other Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

respect to the Purchased Assets or the assets of any Transferred Entities,
be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
taxable period ending on the day before the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period, and (ii) in the
case of any other Tax, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable
if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date. Any refunds or
credits (including prepayments and deposits of Taxes) relating to a Straddle
Period shall be prorated based upon the method employed in this paragraph (b)
taking into account type of the Tax to which the refund or credit relates.
All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations
shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Transferred
Entities and Sellers unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

 

(c) Refunds. If Purchaser or a Transferred Entity receives a refund of Taxes
(or a credit against post-Closing Taxes in lieu of a refund) relating to the
Business or the Purchased Assets for a Tax period (or portion thereof) ending
prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser will pay to the applicable Seller,
within thirty (30) days following the receipt of such refund (or the
application of such credit), an amount equal to such refund (or credit);
provided, however, that such a refund of Taxes is not caused by Sellers or
;the Transferred Entity taking any action prior to Closing or any position on
Tax Returns filed by Sellers inconsistent with past practice that has the
effect of shifting taxable income to Tax periods (or portions thereof) after
the Closing Date. Any such payment shall be treated by the parties as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price. If a Seller receives a refund of Taxes
(or a credit against pre-Closing Taxes in lieu of a refund) relating to the
Business or the Purchased Assets, including Taxes of a Transferred
Entity, for a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing
Date, such Seller will pay to Purchaser, within thirty (30) days following
the receipt of such refund (or the application of such credit), the amount of
such refund (or credit). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Tax refund (or
credit) of any Transferred Entity for a taxable period ending on or before
the Closing Date arising out of the carryback of a loss or credit incurred by
any Transferred Entity in a taxable period ending after the Closing Date, if
such carryback cannot be waived under applicable law, shall be the property
of Purchaser and, if received by Sellers, shall be paid over promptly to
Purchaser within thirty (30) days following the receipt of such refund (or
the application of such credit).

 

 

(d) Settlement of Deficiencies and Adjustments. If any Governmental Authority
issues to Purchaser or a Transferred Entity a notice of deficiency or any
other type of proposed adjustment in writing concerning the operations of a
Transferred Entity or the Business for any taxable period ending before the
Closing Date or for any Straddle Period, Purchaser must notify Sellers within
ten (10) Business Days of receipt of the notice of deficiency or other
proposed adjustment; provided, however, that failure to give such
notification shall not affect any indemnification provided under this
Agreement except to the extent such Sellers shall have been
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Sellers, at their
own expense, have the sole and exclusive right to contest any assessment or
other proposed adjustment to the extent it relates solely to a taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date, and may represent and act on behalf of
the Transferred Entities. Sellers have full right to take any and
all actions and to do any and all things on behalf of themselves or the
Transferred Entities which they deem necessary and appropriate, including,
without limitation, litigating any claim, settling any claim, or waiving the
provision of any applicable statute of limitations as may apply to the
assessment of any Taxes for

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these periods; provided, however, Sellers shall not take any action that
materially increases the Taxes payable by, or otherwise materially adversely
affect the Tax position of, Purchaser or one or more of its Affiliates
following the Closing. If, however, Sellers deem it appropriate not to settle
with respect to any proposed deficiency or other adjustment, Purchaser shall
have the right, at its own expense, to jointly contest with Sellers any such
proposed deficiency or other adjustment. Purchaser also may participate in
any such proceeding if Sellers do not assume the defense of any such
proceeding, and Purchaser may defend the same in such manner as it may deem
appropriate, including settling such proceeding after five (5) days' prior
written notice to Sellers setting forth the terms and conditions of
settlement. With respect to issues relating to a potential adjustment for
which both Sellers and Purchaser or the Transferred Entities could be liable,
(i) both Sellers and Purchaser may participate in the proceeding, and (ii)
the proceeding shall be controlled by that party which would bear the burden
of the greater portion of the sum of the adjustment and any corresponding
adjustments that may reasonably be anticipated for future taxable periods. In
cases where only the Transferred Entity itself can take relevant actions vis-
a-vis the Tax authorities or initiate a contest, the Purchaser and Sellers
will cooperate according to the provisions of Sections 5.15(d) and (e).
Purchaser, at its own expense, has the sole and exclusive right to contest
any assessment or other proposed adjustment to the extent it relates solely
to a taxable period ending after the Closing Date, and may represent and act
on behalf of the Transferred Entities provided that, with respect to any
Taxes of a Transferred Entity for any Straddle Period, Purchaser shall
consult with the applicable Seller as to the resolution of any issue that
would materially affect such Seller, and not settle any such issue without
the consent of such Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. Where consent to a settlement is withheld by such Seller pursuant
to this Section, such Seller may continue or initiate any further proceedings
at its own expense, so long as any liability for Taxes of the applicable
Transferred Entity or Purchaser does not exceed the liability that would have
resulted had such Seller not withheld its consent. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, with respect to any proposed adjustment relating to a
Straddle Period, neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall enter into any
compromise or agree to settle any such adjustment which would adversely
affect the other party for such taxable period or a another taxable period
without the written consent of the other party, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

 

(e) Cooperation and Exchange of Information. Sellers and Purchaser shall
provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them
reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return, amended return
or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to refund
of Taxes or in conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes.
Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of all
relevant Tax Returns, together with accompanying schedules and related
workpapers, documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Taxing
Authorities and records concerning the ownership and tax basis of property,
which either party may possess. Each party shall make its employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide explanation of any documents or
information provided hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party
shall be required to prepare any documents (except tax data packages referred
to below), or determine any information not then in its possession, in
response to a request under this Section 5.15(e).  Except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement, the party requesting assistance hereunder shall
reimburse the other for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in
providing any return, document or other written information upon receipt of
reasonable documentation of such costs, and shall compensate the other for
any reasonable costs (excluding wages and salaries) of making

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

employees available, upon receipt of reasonable documentation of such costs.
Each party will retain and maintain all Tax Returns, schedules and workpapers
and all material records, computer software and data maintained there under,
or other documents relating thereto, until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (including extensions) of the taxable years to which such returns
and other documents relate and, unless such returns and other documents are
offered to the other party, until the final determination of any payments
which may be required in respect of such years under this Agreement and to
give the other party reasonable notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such book and records or computer software and data maintained
there under, and, if the other party so requests, shall allow the other party
to take possession of such books and records or computer software and data
maintained there under.  Any information obtained under this Section
5.15(e) shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in
conducting any audit or other proceeding. Purchaser and the Transferred
Entities shall at their own cost and expense fully and accurately complete in
all material respects and submit any tax data packages in respect of Tax
periods or portions thereof ending prior to the Closing Date reasonably
required by Sellers to satisfy their Tax Return filing obligations within the
time periods reasonably requested by the tax department of Honeywell
consistent with past practices. Purchaser and Sellers further agree, upon
request, to use their commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other
person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).

 

 

(f) Termination of Prior Tax Sharing Agreements. Effective on or before the
day prior to the Closing Date, all Tax sharing agreements, whether or not
written, to which any Seller and a Transferred Entity are parties shall be
terminated at or prior to the Closing, and the Transferred Entity shall have
no further rights or obligations thereunder, and the provisions of this
Agreement shall govern the rights and obligations of Sellers, Purchaser and
the Transferred Entities to make or receive payments with respect to Taxes or
refunds of Taxes of the Transferred Entities. Sellers shall execute (and
shall cause the Transferred Entities to execute) any documents that may be
reasonably required to evidence agreement with this Section 5.15 (f).
Sellers, at or prior to Closing, shall terminate the domination and profit
transfer agreement (Beherrschungs- und Gewinnabfuhrungsvertrag) to which HCS
Germany is a party effective as of the end of the day prior the Closing Date.
Sellers and Purchasers agree that (i) the domination and profit transfer
agreement will be duly performed until the end of the day prior the Closing
Date, (ii) Sellers shall be entitled to any profits and obliged to cover any
losses of HCS Germany until such date, and (iii) Sellers will indemnify and
hold Purchasers harmless against any and all Losses (without reference to
Section 9.4) resulting from (A) a failure to terminate such domination and
profit transfer agreement with effect as of the end of the day prior to the
Closing Date, and/or (B) the non-recognition for tax purposes of the fiscal
unit (Organschaft) between HCS Germany and Honeywell Deutschland GmbH until
the end of the day prior to the Closing Date. The Sellers further agree that
they will make any payments pursuant to the preceding sentence without undue
delay and that, if not terminated with effect as of the end of the day prior
to the Closing Date, the domination and profit transfer agreement will be
terminated by the parties as soon as possible after the Closing Date. The
parties further agree that (i) the profits or losses of HCS Germany as of the
end of the day prior to the Closing Date shall be determined based on an
interim pro-forma income statement and balance sheet as of such date to be
drawn up by HCS Germany pursuant to applicable German GAAP as soon as
practicable after the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Closing Date and to be agreed by Sellers and Purchasers, (ii) if Sellers and
Purchasers do not agree on such income statement and pro-forma balance sheet
within 6 months of the Closing Date, then any dispute shall be submitted to a
"big four" accounting firm whose resolution of the dispute shall be final and
binding on the parties and the fees of whom shall be paid 50% by each party,
(iii) the amount of profits or losses of HCS Germany determined according to
(i) or (ii) above shall be paid in the case of profits by HCS Germany to
Honeywell Deutschland GmbH, and in the case of losses by Honeywell
Deutschland GmbH to HCS Germany, in both cases to be paid within 30 days
after determination, and (iv) immediately upon receipt of any such payment
(A) from HCS Germany to Honeywell Deutschland GmbH, Honeywell Deutschland
GmbH shall pay MandM Germany an amount equal to the amount Honeywell
Deutschland GmbH received from HCS Germany or (B) from Honeywell Deutschland
GmbH to HCS Germany, MandM Germany shall pay Honeywell Deutschland GmbH an
amount equal to the amount Honeywell Deutschland GmbH paid to HCS Germany,
which payment in either case shall be treated as an adjustment of the
purchase price paid by MandM Germany to Honeywell Deutschland GmbH for the
Equity Interest in HCS Germany. Purchaser will use best efforts that (i) the
profits or losses of HCS Germany as of the end of the day prior to the
Closing Date, as so agreed by the parties or determined by the "big four"
accounting firm, shall be properly reflected in accordance with German GAAP
and applicable law in the next statutory accounts of HCS Germany after
the end of the day prior to the Closing and (ii) such statutory accounts
shall be approved by the shareholder of HCS Germany.

 

 

(g) Check the Box Elections. Sellers shall make a valid election under
Treas. Reg. Sec. 301.7701-3, effective on or before the day prior to the
Closing Date, for each Transferred Entity to be disregarded as an entity
separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes and shall
deliver copies of completed and filed Forms 8832 to Purchasers at or before
Closing demonstrating the making of such an election. For U.S. federal income
tax purposes, Honeywell and the Purchaser agree to treat the transfer of the
Equity Interests in each of the Transferred Entities pursuant to this
Agreement as taxable sales of their assets to MandM Germany and MandM France,
respectively, and to treat the transfer by Honeywell UK of Purchased Assets
relating to the UK Business as a taxable sale, and no party will assert or
maintain a position inconsistent with such treatment.

 

 

(h) VAT Matters. The following provisions shall apply with respect to VAT
relating to the sale of the Purchased Assets relating to the UK
Business under this Agreement.

 

 

(i) Honeywell UK and Purchaser of the Purchased Assets relating to the UK
Business ("UK Purchaser") intend and shall use all reasonable endeavors to
procure that Article 5 of the Value Added Tax (Special Provisions Order) 1995
shall apply to the sale of the Purchased Assets relating to the UK Business
under this Agreement, so that the sale is treated as neither a supply of
goods nor a supply of services for VAT purposes.

 

 

(ii) If nevertheless HM Revenue and Customs ("HMRC") have ruled in
writing after full disclosure of all material facts that VAT is payable by UK
Purchaser on the supply of the Purchased Assets relating to the UK Business
under this Agreement then VAT on that supply shall be borne 50% by UK
Purchaser and 50% by Honeywell UK in the following manner:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(A) The amount of any consideration required to be paid by UK Purchaser on
the supply of the Purchased Assets relating to the UK Business under this
Agreement shall be exclusive of VAT (such that the amount of VAT chargeable
on that supply shall be payable in addition to that consideration) and
Honeywell UK shall promptly deliver to UK Purchaser a proper VAT invoice in
respect of the supply (together with a copy of the ruling in writing by HMRC
and copies of the documents disclosing all material facts to HMRC);

 

 

(B) UK Purchaser shall promptly pay the amount of VAT shown on any invoice
delivered by Honeywell UK in accordance with (A) above promptly after it has
actually obtained all credits, deductions, refunds, refunds and repayments
relating to that VAT so shown;

 

 

(C) Promptly following any payment made by UK Purchaser in accordance with
(B) above Honeywell UK and UK Purchaser shall make all necessary adjustments
to the consideration such that the amount of (1) VAT chargeable on the supply
of Purchased Assets relating to the UK Business under this Agreement, after
taking into account the amount of (2) all credits, deductions, refunds and
repayments actually obtained by UK Purchaser in respect of VAT chargeable on
that supply (the amount of (1) less (2) being "Irrecoverable VAT"), results
in UK Purchaser and Honeywell UK each bearing an amount equal to 50% of the
amount of the Irrecoverable VAT that would have arisen if this
Section 15.5(h)(ii)(B) had not had effect; and

 

 

(D) UK Purchaser and Honeywell UK shall promptly make all such payments and
repayments to each other, and Honeywell UK shall promptly issue all such
further invoices and credit notes in respect of VAT, in each case as may be
required in order to give effect to the foregoing.

 

 

(iii) MandM Aerospace Hardware Ltd is registered for VAT in the United Kingdom
under VAT No. GB928748768. If UK Purchaser is not MandM Aerospace Hardware
Ltd but another UK limited company, UK Purchaser shall provide evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Honeywell UK that it is registered for VAT in the
United Kingdom at the Closing.

 

 

(i) UK Business. The parties agree that Sections 5.15(a), (b) and (c) above
shall not apply to any Taxes relating to, or Tax Returns required to be filed
in respect of, the UK Business.

 

 

(j) Change of Accounting Period. Sellers shall not have the right to change
the fiscal year end/accounting period of either or both of the Transferred
Entities, provided that this Section 5.15(j) does not affect the operation
of Section 5.15(f).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(k) Withholding Taxes. The Purchasers shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from all amounts payable to the Sellers under this Agreement such
amounts that the Purchasers are required to deduct and withhold and pay over
to the applicable Taxing Authority under any applicable Law. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the
applicable Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
as having been paid to the Sellers. If one or more of the Purchasers intends
to deduct and withhold from any Stock Consideration or Cash Consideration
payable to the Sellers under this Agreement, the Purchaser shall notify the
Sellers in writing at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the date
withholding is required, together with a statement setting forth the amount
to be deducted and withheld. If the Sellers object in writing to the
Purchaser's determination within seven (7) Business Days of such notice, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree on the amount that should be
deducted and withheld. If the parties are unable to agree on such amount
prior to the applicable payment date, they shall request a mutually agreeable
independent leading law firm or accounting firm in the relevant jurisdiction
to render an opinion on the amount required to be deducted and withheld,
which opinion, absent manifest error, shall be conclusive and binding and the
disputed amount of withholding shall be transferred by the Purchaser to a
mutually agreeable independent escrow agent, which shall hold the disputed
amount until such law firm or accounting firm has rendered its opinion and
subsequently release the amount to the Purchaser and/or the Sellers as
directed by such opinion. The costs incurred in connection with the
engagement of such law firm or accounting firm and escrow agent shall be paid
by the party whose position was not followed pursuant to this
Section 5.15(j).

 

 

5.16 Bulk Sales Laws. Sellers and Purchaser each hereby waive compliance
by Honeywell with the provisions of the "bulk sales," "bulk transfer" or
similar Laws of any state.

 

 

5.17 Notice of Developments. Prior to the Closing, Sellers and
Purchaser shall promptly notify each other in writing of all events,
circumstances, facts and occurrences arising subsequent to the date of this
Agreement which would be reasonably likely to result in any condition in
Article VI or Article VII becoming incapable of being satisfied.

 

 

5.18 Purchaser's Financing. Purchaser shall, and shall cause each of
its Affiliates to, use its commercially reasonable best efforts to do or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper and advisable to arrange and
close concurrently with the Closing, the financing on terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letter (including the institution against
the Initial Lenders, and prompt prosecution in good faith, of litigation to
enforce the Debt Commitment Letter, obtaining rating agency approvals,
maintaining in effect the Debt Commitment Letter, satisfying on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to Purchaser to obtaining the financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, negotiating and entering into
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on terms and
conditions contained therein, satisfying all conditions applicable to the
Purchaser in such definitive agreements that are within their respective
control and, if necessary, borrowing pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter
in the event any "flex" provisions are exercised). Purchaser shall keep
Honeywell informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to arrange the terms of, and satisfy the conditions
contemplated by, the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter in
accordance with this Section 5.18 and shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Affiliates to, agree or permit any cancellation, amendment, supplement or
other modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy
under, the Debt

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Commitment Letters without obtaining the prior written consent of Honeywell
other than (x) any amendment, supplement or other modification to the Debt
Commitment Letter adding additional lenders thereto or (y) any replacement,
amendment, supplement or other modification to the Debt Commitment Letter
resulting in terms that are no less beneficial to Purchaser (including with
respect to conditionality) and that would not reasonably be expected to
prevent, delay or impede the consummation of the financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that no such replacement, amendment, supplement
or waiver reduces the amount of the financing available thereunder; provided
further that Purchaser shall only replace (i) the Debt Commitment Letter if
the Initial Lenders thereunder threaten or indicate their intention not to
fund such that the Financing is unlikely to be available or (ii) an Initial
Lender thereunder in the event one or more such Initial Lenders threaten or
indicate its or their intention not to fund its or their commitment under the
Debt Commitment Letter; provided that in each case, any such replacement
shall not release any Initial Lender under its obligations under the Debt
Commitment Letter, unless such replacement is an internationally recognized
financial institution reasonably satisfactory to Sellers. Purchaser shall
promptly notify Honeywell (and in any event within one Business Day) of any
material breach by any party of the Debt Commitment Letter, any termination
of the Debt Commitment Letter or any other circumstance, event or condition
that would reasonably be likely to prevent, delay or impede the consummation
of the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, to the extent it
becomes aware of such breach, termination, circumstance, event or condition.
Purchaser shall segregate any net proceeds received after the date hereof and
prior to Closing from any debt or equity financing of Purchaser, and shall
use such net proceeds solely for the purpose of funding the Purchase Price.

 

 

5.19 Sellers' Assistance with Financing. Prior to the Closing, Sellers agree
to provide, and shall cause the Transferred Entities to provide, all
reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of any Financing of
Purchaser in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the "Financing") as may be reasonably
requested by Purchaser (provided such requested cooperation does
not interfere in any significant respect with the ongoing operation of the
Business or the conduct of Honeywell's or any Seller's business), including:

 

 

(a) participation by appropriate representatives of Honeywell in due
diligence sessions related to the Business and the Purchased Assets with
Purchaser and its representatives and Purchaser's Financing sources and its
representatives;

 

 

(b) with respect to the Business and the Purchased Assets, assisting
Purchaser and its Financing sources in the preparation of any offering
documents, offering memoranda, offering circulars, prospectuses, registration
statements under the Securities Act to be filed by the Purchaser with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, bank information memoranda or other
disclosure documents requested by Purchaser and materials for rating agency
presentations in connection with the Financing; provided in all cases that
Sellers have access to any such information or can compile or procure the
same without undue effort or expense and provided further that Sellers shall
not be required to deliver information subject to confidentiality or attorney
client privilege restrictions (each, a "Disclosure Document");

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) furnishing Purchaser and its Financing sources as promptly as practicable
with the financial and other information regarding the Business set forth on
Schedule 5.19(c) (the financial and other information required to be
delivered pursuant to this clause (c) is referred to as the
"Required Information");

 

 

(d) assisting in the preparation and review of pro forma financial statements
of Purchaser giving effect to the acquisition by Purchaser of the Business
and the Assets and meeting the requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act; and

 

 

(e) using commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the independent
accountants of Sellers, subject to reimbursement by Purchaser of any related
fees incurred by Sellers, to take such actions as Purchaser may reasonably
request in connection with the Financing, including, without limitation, to
(i) obtain the consent of the independent accountants of Sellers to the use
of its reports on the Audited Financial Statements, (ii) deliver a "comfort
letter" to Purchaser's Financing sources in a form meeting the requirements
of Statement of Auditing Standards No. 72 - Letters for Underwriters and
Certain Other Requesting Parties, as such statement has been amended or
modified, or such other form as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser or
its Financing sources, (iii) perform a review of the Marketing Interim
Financial Statements pursuant to the requirements of Statement of Auditing
Standards No. 100 - Interim Financial Information or such other requirements
requested by Purchaser or its Financing sources as may be customary, (iv)
participate in customary auditor due diligence sessions with the Financing
sources of Purchaser, counsel to such Financing sources and Purchaser and its
representatives and (v) enter into customary agreements or engagements with
accountants.

 

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) no Seller, Transferred Entity or officer,
director or employee of any Seller or Transferred Entity shall be required to
execute any documents, including any registration statement to be filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission except as may be required by
Honeywell's independent accountants in connection with any Financing, (B) no
Seller shall be required to pay a commitment or similar fee or incur any
other Liability in connection with any Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters, (C) no any Seller shall be required to issue a private
placement memoranda or prospectus (and no such private placement memoranda or
prospectus shall reflect any Seller as the issuer), and (D) no Seller shall
be required to indemnify any Person in connection with the Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. Purchaser shall reimburse Sellers
for all reasonable and documented out of pocket costs, fees and expense
incurred by any Seller or any Transferred Entity in connection with such
cooperation and assistance described in this Section 5.19. Purchaser shall
indemnify and hold harmless each Seller and their Affiliates and each of
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives,
successors and assigns from and against any and all Losses suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and any information utilized in
connection therewith. The failure to provide any Required Information, or any
other information or take any action described in this Section 5.19 shall not
be a breach of this Section 5.19. Sellers make no representation or warranty
as to any of the materials or information provided to Purchaser pursuant to
this Section 5.19.

 

 

5.20 Delivery of Financial Information. (a) Honeywell shall deliver to
Purchaser on or about June 12, 2008 (but no later than June 30, 2008) the
Audited Financial Statements, and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending
immediately prior to the Closing Date, Honeywell shall provide Purchaser (i)
within 30 days of the end of each fiscal month and, (ii) within 45 days of
the end of each fiscal quarter (including the fiscal quarter ended March 29,
2008, provided that the March 29 information shall be delivered to Purchaser
on or about June 18, 2008 and no later than June 30, 2008), the unaudited
consolidated balance sheets and related statements of income and cash flows
for the Business for each such fiscal quarter and for each completed fiscal
month since the last such quarter ended, which unaudited fiscal quarterly
financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and, in the
cases of all monthly financial statements, as modified by the Specified
Accounting Policies, on a basis otherwise consistent with the Audited
Financial Statements and, in the case of any fiscal quarter, (x) set forth in
each case in comparative form the figures for the corresponding fiscal
quarter of the previous fiscal year and (y) shall have been reviewed by the
independent accountants of Honeywell as provided in Statement on Auditing
Standards No. 100 (each such set of statements in this clause (ii) being
"Marketing Interim Financial Statements"). Purchaser and its accountants
shall have until the earlier of (A) five (5) Business Days from the date of
delivery of the Audited Financial Statements or (B) the day prior to any
public disclosure of, the Audited Financial Statements to review and discuss
the Audited Financial Statements with Honeywell and Honeywell's
independent accountant who provided the audit report with respect to such
Audited Financial Statements; provided that Honeywell shall, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its independent accountant to, provide
reasonable access to the necessary personnel and audit work papers for the
Business following delivery of the Audited Financial Statements, provided,
however, that Purchaser's representatives and accountants shall execute any
customary "hold harmless" or similar agreements reasonably requested by
Honeywell's independent accountants in connection with access to such audit
papers for the Business. If the Audited Financial Statements materially and
adversely differ, on an aggregate basis, with respect to financial condition
or results of operation set forth in the Year-End Financials without giving
effect to the adjustments set forth on Schedule 5.20, Purchaser may terminate
the Agreement as set forth in Section 8.1(b); provided that in the event of
such termination, Sellers shall have no liability or obligation to Purchaser.
If Purchaser does not terminate the Agreement within such period, Purchaser
shall be deemed to have accepted the Audited Financial Statements as
delivered by Sellers and shall not have any right to terminate the Agreement
on account of its disagreement or dissatisfaction with the Audited Financial
Statements, except where the independent accountant of Honeywell has
withdrawn or qualified its audit report with respect to the Audited Financial
Statements.

 

 

5.21 Conduct of Purchaser's Business. Purchaser shall not and shall cause its
Affiliates not to (as it relates to the Purchaser's business):

 

 

(a) during the VWAP Measurement Period, issue, deliver, sell, pledge or
encumber, or authorize, propose or agree to the issuance (or otherwise
announce the issuance of), delivery, sale, pledge or encumbrance of, any
shares of the capital stock of the Purchaser, or securities convertible into
or exchangeable for, or options, warrants, calls, commitments or rights of
any kind to acquire, any shares of any class or series of the capital stock
of Purchaser (other than (i) pursuant to the existing stock option or similar
equity incentive agreements with employees or directors of Purchaser or to
such individuals pursuant to Purchaser's stock option or similar equity
incentive plans, in each case as in existence on the date hereof and as
identified in Schedule 5.21, or (ii) pursuant to the vesting and/or exercise
of stock options or similar equity

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

rights by employees or directors of Purchaser that are in existence on the
date hereof or (B) granted or issued after the date hereof pursuant to clause
(i) of this subsection;

 

 

(b) during the VWAP Measurement Period reclassify, combine, split, subdivide
or redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of its
capital stock;

 

 

(c) subject to Section 5.5(c), enter into any agreement with respect to or
consummate an acquisition or acquisitions of the business, stock, assets or
other properties of any other Person(s), other than acquisitions that
collectively do not provide for consideration in the aggregate in excess of
$100,000,000 to the extent permitted in writing by all of the Initial Lenders
under the Debt Commitment Letter, with satisfactory evidence of such approval
delivered to Sellers concurrently;

 

 

(d) take any action that would hinder or delay the ability of Purchaser to
obtain the Financing; or

 

 

(e) fail to notify Sellers of the occurrence of any event or the existence of
any condition which could reasonably be expected to result in a Purchaser
Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

5.22 Conduct of Incidents Subject to Parent Insurances. The Purchaser
acknowledges that coverage for the Business under the Parent Insurances will
cease as of the Closing Date, and that neither the Sellers nor any of their
Affiliates will purchase any "tail" policy or other additional or substitute
coverage for the benefit of Purchaser relating to the Parent Insurances or
the Business applicable in any period after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
this provision, the Sellers agree that Honeywell, or one of its Affiliates,
shall, with respect to any incident from which an Assumed Liability arises
that is covered by a Parent Insurance policy in effect prior to the Closing
Date, (i) report such incident to the appropriate insurer as promptly as
practicable after such incident is reported to a member of Honeywell's
Corporate Risk Management group, (ii) include the Purchaser on material
correspondence and possible litigation proceedings relating to such incident
and (iii) pay over to Purchaser any third-party insurance proceeds actually
received by Honeywell or any of its Affiliates under any Parent Insurances
(net of any deductible or retention amounts) with respect to such incident or
instruct that such proceeds are paid directly to the injured party in
settlement of any claims relating to such incident, rather than to Honeywell
or its Affiliates; provided that the Purchaser shall notify Honeywell
Corporate Risk Management group promptly of any potential claim, shall
cooperate in the investigation and pursuit of any claim and shall bear all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Sellers or its Affiliates
in connection with the foregoing and provided further that the Sellers and
their Affiliates shall be obligated to use only commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue any claims that are covered by available Parent Insurance
and shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, have any obligation to commence
any litigation with respect to any matter potentially covered by any Parent
Insurance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Honeywell nor any Seller
makes any representation or warranty as to whether any recovery under any
Parent Insurance will be received with respect to any particular incident
arising before or after the Closing Date. Purchaser agrees that no Seller
shall have any liability under this Agreement or otherwise for any
Liabilities for failure to report in a timely manner or for delays
in reporting by Purchaser or its Affiliates that void any available coverage
under Parent Insurance.

5.23 Supply Agreement Pricing.

 

 

(a) The parties shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to work
together to, on a part number-by-part number basis, no later than July 15,
2008, set the price for each of the Products contained in Attachments 1-A and
1-B to the Supply Agreement (based on the methodology set forth below). The
parties agree that, based upon 2007 volumes, with respect to the Initial
Products (as defined in the Supply Agreement), Attachments 1-A and 1-B to the
Supply Agreement shall reflect aggregate revenues to Seller equal to $78.3
million, reflecting volumes of such Initial Products that were within the
Business as of the date of this Agreement; provided that (i) for those
additional volumes to be added to the scope of the Supply Agreement not
currently within the Business and which reflect the same part numbers as
those part numbers comprising part numbers for the Initial Products, Buyer
shall re-price such part numbers to reflect the expanded volumes provided by
Seller to Buyer, and (ii) for those additional volumes to be added to the
scope of the Supply Agreement not currently within the Business and which
reflect new part numbers not previously comprising part numbers for the
Initial Products, such part numbers shall be priced in accordance to the
methodology set forth in Section 5(c) to the Supply Agreement. In the event
the additional volumes added to the scope of the Supply Agreement pursuant to
(i) and (ii) above affect the scope of Section 4(b) of the Supply Agreement,
the parties agree to amend such Section 4(b) as necessary and appropriate to
reflect such additional volumes.

 

 

(b) If the parties are unable to agree to pricing for any Products set forth
on Attachments 1-A or 1-B of the Supply Agreement by July 15, 2008, then the
price for such Products shall be determined no later than July 31, 2008 under
the following method: Multiplying by 1.55 the lesser of either (i)
Buyer's then-current price for such Products pursuant to its then-applicable
purchase commitments; or (ii) Seller's then-current actual cost for
such Products.

TERMINATION; EFFECT OF TERMINATION

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

64  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8.1 Termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:

 

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Purchaser and Sellers;

 

 

(b) by Purchaser, if (i) the transactions contemplated hereby are not
consummated on or before October 31, 2008 (the "Deadline") as a result of
the failure of a condition in Article VI, unless such failure was caused by
Purchaser's breach of a covenant or agreement contained herein, or (ii) any
Seller or Transferred Entity shall have breached any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement which would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Article VI, which
breach cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days after
the giving of written notice by Purchaser to Sellers specifying such breach,
or (iii) pursuant to Section 5.20(c); or

 

 

(c) by Sellers, if (i) the transactions contemplated hereby are not
consummated on or before the Deadline as a result of the failure of a
condition in Article VII, unless such failure was caused by Seller's breach
of a covenant or agreement contained herein, or (ii) Purchaser shall have
breached any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement which would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Article VII, which breach cannot be or has not been
cured within thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice by Sellers
to Purchaser specifying such breach.

 

 

8.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further
force and effect, and none of the parties hereto (nor their respective
Affiliates, directors, shareholders, officers, employees, agents,
consultants, attorneys in fact or other representatives) shall have any
liability in respect of such termination; provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, if such termination is effected pursuant
to Section 8.1(b) or (c) as a result of a breach of a covenant or agreement
contained herein, or in the case of termination pursuant to Section 8.1(c),
as a result of Purchaser's breach of its representation and warranty
contained in Section 4.5, then, except as provided in Section 5.20,
the party having so breached shall remain liable to the other party hereto
on account of such breach, and the non breaching party shall retain all
rights in equity or law arising as a result of such breach. The provisions
of this Section 8.2 and Article X shall survive any termination of this
Agreement.

 

 

ARTICLE IX

 

 

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

 

 

9.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Agreements. The
representations and warranties of the parties contained in Articles III
and IV shall, subject to the proviso to this sentence, terminate on the date
that is 18 months after the Closing Date, provided, however, that (i) the
representation and warranties in Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.20, and the
last sentence of Section 3.3 and in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.6, 4.7, 4.12 and
4.13 shall survive indefinitely, (ii) the representations and warranties in
Section 3.7 shall survive until ninety (90) days following the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitation for the final assessment or collection
of the relevant Taxes, or in the case of Taxes of or otherwise imposed upon a

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

65  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Transferred Entity, if later, the final assessment or collection of the
relevant Taxes (the representations of Honeywell described in clauses (i) and
(ii), the "Seller Fundamental Representations and Warranties" and each a
"Seller Fundamental Representation and Warranty"), and (iii) the
representations and warranties in Section 3.11 shall terminate on the date
that is three (3) years after the Closing Date. All covenants and agreements
contained herein which by their terms contemplate actions or impose
obligations following the Closing shall survive the Closing and remain in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For the avoidance of
doubt, all covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement relating to
Taxes and any claims against or obligations of Sellers pursuant to Section
5.15 shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect until
ninety (90) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitation for the final assessment or collection of the relevant Taxes, or
in the case of Taxes of or otherwise imposed upon a Transferred Entity, if
later, the final assessment or collection of the relevant Taxes. The period
of time a representation or warranty or covenant or agreement survives the
Closing pursuant to this Section 9.1 shall be the "Survival Period" with
respect to such representation or warranty or covenant or agreement. In the
event notice of any claim for indemnification under this Article IX
shall have been given within the applicable Survival Period and such claim
has not been finally resolved by the expiration of such Survival Period,
the representations or warranties or covenants or agreements that are the
subject of such claim shall survive (but only, for any such claim that is
reasonably estimable, to the extent of and in the amount of the claim as made
prior to the expiration of the Survival Period, and otherwise for the full
amount of such claim), until such claim is finally resolved.

 

 

9.2 Indemnification. Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set
forth in this Article IX, from and after the Closing Date:

 

 

(a) Honeywell shall, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates
and each of their respective officers, directors, members, partners,
managers, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the
"Purchaser Indemnified Parties") from and against any Losses that are imposed
on or incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties arising out of or in
connection with (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by
Sellers in Article III, (it being understood that such representations and
warranties shall be interpreted without giving effect to any limitations or
qualifications as to ""Business Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein
(other than in Section 3.6(b)), modified by the Disclosure Schedule; for
avoidance of doubt, any "material" or "materiality" limitations or
qualifications shall be given full effect in the representations and
warranties, (ii) any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of Sellers
set forth in this Agreement, or (iii) the Retained Liabilities.

 

 

(b) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Honeywell, each Seller and
their Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, members,
partners, managers, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively,
the "Seller Indemnified Parties") from and against any Losses that are
imposed on or incurred by Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in Article IV,
as modified by the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, (ii) any failure to
perform any covenant or agreement of Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement, (iii) the Assumed Liabilities, (iv) any obligations or Liabilities
of Purchaser described in Sections 5.8 or 5.19 or (v) the conduct of the
Business acquired by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement and the ownership,
use and possession of the Purchased Assets on or after the Closing Date other
than for any matter as to which Honeywell is

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party under this Article IX,
taking into account any limitations set forth herein.

 

 

9.3 Indemnification Procedures.

 

 

(a) In order for a party (the "Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Article IX in respect of a claim made
against the Indemnified Party by any Person who is not a party to this
Agreement (a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party must notify the
indemnifying party hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing of the
Third-Party Claim promptly following receipt by such Indemnified Party of
notice of the Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly following the Indemnified
Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim,
other than those notices and documents separately addressed to the
Indemnifying Party.

 

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Third-Party Claim which relates to any
Losses indemnifiable hereunder and to select counsel of its choice. If
the Indemnifying Party (i) does not within 10 business days of its receipt of
notice of a Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 9.3(a) elect to defend
against or negotiate any Third-Party Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnifiable hereunder or (ii) after assuming such control fails
to diligently defend against such Third-Party Claim in good faith, then
the applicable Indemnified Party may defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with such Third-Party Claim with counsel reasonably acceptable
to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
of any Third-Party Claim, the applicable Indemnified Party may participate,
at its own expense, in the defense of such Third-Party Claim; provided,
however, that if there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of
interest that would make it inappropriate in the judgment of the Indemnified
Party in its reasonable discretion for the same counsel to represent both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to retain one counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if it is
ultimately determined that the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide
indemnification under this Article IX and subject to the various provisions
and limitations of this Article IX..

 

 

(c) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall (and shall cause the applicable
Indemnified Parties to) cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and
make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's
expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in the
Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified Party's control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party and
provide the Indemnifying Party with access to facilities as necessary.
Similarly, if the Indemnified Party is defending or prosecuting such Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall (and shall cause the applicable
Indemnified Parties to) cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and
make available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense,
all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying
Party's possession or under the Indemnifying Party's control relating thereto

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

67  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as is reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third-Party Claim, no
such Third Party-Claim may be settled, compromised or discharged by the
Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless any such
settlement, compromise or discharge (i) obligates the Indemnifying Party (or
its Affiliates) to pay the full amount of the Liability in connection with
such Third-Party Claim, (ii) no injunctive or other equitable relief would be
imposed against any Indemnified Party and (iii) unconditionally releases all
Indemnified Parties from all further liability in respect of such Third-Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of a Third-
Party Claim or is not permitted to assume such defense, the applicable
Indemnified Parties shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying
Party's prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

 

 

(d) Any Third Party Claim relating to Taxes shall be governed by Section
5.15(d).

 

 

(e) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party under this Article IX that does not involve a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party promptly following the Indemnified Party becoming aware of
the same. The failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may
have to such Indemnified Party under this Article IX, except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party has been actually and materially prejudiced by
such failure.

 

 

9.4 Indemnification Limitations.

 

 

(a) In no event shall Honeywell be liable for indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.2(a)(i) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Losses with
respect to Section 9.2(a)(i) that are imposed on or incurred by Purchaser
exceeds $10,000,000 (the "Threshold Amount"), in which case Purchaser shall
be entitled to indemnification for all Losses in excess of the Threshold
Amount; provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this sentence
shall not apply with respect to any claim for indemnification in respect of
any breach of a Seller Fundamental Representation and Warranty.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Honeywell shall not (x) be required to make
payments for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) in an aggregate
amount in excess of $150,000,000 or (y) be liable for indemnification with
respect to any Loss by an Indemnified Party of less than $25,000 (each, a "De
Minimis Loss") and all such Losses shall be disregarded and shall not
be aggregated for purposes of the Threshold Amount; provided, however, that
the limitations set forth in clauses (x) and (y) of this sentence shall
not apply with respect to any claim for indemnification in respect of any
Seller Fundamental Representation and Warranty; however, in no event shall
Honeywell be liable for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) with
respect to breaches of Seller Fundamental Representations and Warranties for
any Losses in excess of the Cash Consideration.

 

 

(b) In calculating amounts payable to an Indemnified Party hereunder, the
amount of any indemnified Losses shall be determined without duplication of
any other Loss for which an indemnification claim has been made under any
other representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement and shall be computed
net of (i) amounts recoverable by the Indemnified Party under indemnification
agreements or arrangements with third parties or under any insurance policy
of Honeywell or any Seller relating to the period prior to the Closing with
respect to such Losses (each, a "Collateral Source"), and (ii) any actual
prior recovery by the Indemnified

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Party from any Person with respect to such Losses. In the event of
any indemnification claim paid, the Indemnifying Party may, in its sole
discretion, require any Indemnified Party to grant to such Indemnifying Party
an assignment of the right of such Indemnified Party to assert a claim
against any Collateral Source. If the amount to be netted hereunder from any
payment required under Article IX is determined after payment of any amount
otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnified Party under this Article IX,
the Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after
such determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had
to pay pursuant to this Article IX had such determination been made at the
time of such payment.

 

 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, in no event shall
Honeywell or any Seller be liable for (i) any punitive damages or any
special, incidental, indirect or consequential damages of any kind or nature,
regardless of the form of action through which such damages are sought, (ii)
any diminution in value or lost profits of any Indemnified Party except for
lost profits which constitute direct damages; (iii) without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, any Loss calculated by using or taking into
account any multiples of (A) earnings, (B) book value, (C) cash flow or (D)
other measures, unless, in the case of clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), such
damages are recovered by a third party in a Third Party Claim pursuant to an
order entered against a Purchaser Indemnified Party or in a settlement
agreement to which a Purchaser Indemnified Party is a party, (iv) any Losses
arising from Purchaser failing to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages,
or (v) any Losses to the extent such Liabilities are reserved on the
Financial Statements of the Sellers that are Made Available to Purchaser
prior to the date hereof.

 

 

(d) Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to Contracts,
leases, licenses or other agreements to which Honeywell, any Seller or any
Transferred Entity is a party (including the Material Contracts) and such
consents have not been obtained and may not be obtained. Purchaser agrees
that neither Honeywell nor any Seller shall have any liability (other than,
if breached, under Section 3.4 or Section 5.5(b)) whatsoever to Purchaser
(and Purchaser shall not be entitled to assert any claims) arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any consents that may have been or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or because of the default, acceleration or termination of or loss of right
under any such Contract, lease, license or other agreement as a result
thereof. Other than, if breached, Section 3.4 or Section 5.5(b), Purchaser
further agrees that no representation, warranty or covenant of the Sellers
contained herein shall be breached or deemed breached and no condition of
Purchaser shall be deemed not to be satisfied as a result of the failure to
obtain any consent or as a result of any such default, acceleration or
termination or loss of right or any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding or
investigation commenced or threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising
out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consent or any such default,
acceleration or termination or loss of right.

 

 

(e) Except with respect to fraud, notwithstanding anything else contained in
this Agreement to the contrary, after the Closing, indemnification pursuant
to the provisions of this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the parties from and after the Closing

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

69  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Date with respect to any and all claims arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including in respect
of any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant or other
provision contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto. Without limiting the generality or effect of the
foregoing, as a material inducement to the other parties hereto entering into
this Agreement, Purchaser hereby waives, from and after the Closing, any
claim or cause of action, known and unknown, foreseen and unforeseen, which
it or any of its Affiliates may have against the other parties hereto
(including rights to indemnification or contribution, or any other rights or
remedies), including without limitation under the common law or federal or
state securities Laws, trade regulation Laws or other Laws (including any
relating to Tax, environmental, real estate or employee matters), by reason
of this Agreement, the events giving rise to this Agreement and the
transactions provided for herein or contemplated hereby or thereby, except
for claims or causes of action brought under and subject to the terms and
conditions of the provisions contained in this Article IX.

 

 

(f) All payments made pursuant to this Article IX shall be deemed to be
adjustments to the Purchase Price.

 

 

9.5 No Rights of Offset. Purchaser waives and relinquishes any and all
rights to set off or to apply any monies held or indebtedness or other
obligations now or hereafter owing by Purchaser to Sellers or any of their
Affiliates against any obligations of Sellers or any of their Affiliates now
or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other agreement,
instrument, certificate or similar document required to be delivered pursuant
to this Agreement.

(a) In the event of any dispute, controversy or claim in any way arising out
of or relating to the Transaction Matters (a "Dispute"), upon the
written notice of either party hereto, the parties hereto shall attempt to
negotiate a resolution of the Dispute. If the parties hereto are unable for
any reason to resolve a Dispute within 30 days after the receipt of such
notice, the Dispute shall be submitted to mediation in accordance with
Section 10.10(b) hereof.

 

 

(b) Any Dispute not resolved pursuant to Section 10.10(a) hereof shall, at
the request of either party hereto (a "Mediation Request"), be submitted to

Procedure (the "Procedure"), except as modified herein. The mediation shall
be held in New York, New York. The parties shall have 20 days from receipt by
a party of a Mediation Request to agree on a mediator. If no mediator has
been agreed upon by the parties within 20 days of receipt by a party (or
parties) of a Mediation Request, then any party may request (on written
notice to the other parties), that the CPR appoint a mediator in accordance
with the Procedure. All mediation pursuant to this clause shall
be confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement
negotiations, and no oral or documentary representations made by the parties
during such mediation shall be admissible for any purpose in any subsequent
proceedings. No party hereto shall disclose or permit the disclosure of any
information about the evidence adduced or the documents produced by the other
parties in the mediation proceedings or about the existence, contents or
results of the mediation without the prior written consent of such other
parties except in the course of a judicial or regulatory proceeding or as may
be required by Law or requested by a Governmental Authority or securities
exchange. Before making any disclosure permitted by the preceding sentence,
the party intending to make such disclosure shall give the other parties
reasonable written notice of the intended disclosure and afford the other
parties a reasonable opportunity to protect its interests. If the Dispute has
not been resolved within 60 days of the appointment of a Mediator, or within
90 days of receipt by a party of a Mediation Request (whichever occurs
sooner), or within such longer period as the parties may agree to in writing,
then any party may file an action on the Dispute in any court having
jurisdiction in accordance with Section 10.10(c).

 

 

(c) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York

located in New York County, New York for any litigation arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any
litigation relating hereto except in such courts), and further agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail
to its respective address set forth in Section 10.1, shall be effective
service of process for any litigation brought against it in any such court.
Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any litigation arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby in the courts of the State of New York
sitting in New York County or the courts of the United States of
America located in New York County, New York and hereby further irrevocably
and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such litigation brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
CONNECTION WITH ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO
TRANSACTION MATTERS.
