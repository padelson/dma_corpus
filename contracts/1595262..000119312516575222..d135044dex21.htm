Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the DGCL, at the Effective Time, IMS Health shall be merged with and into

take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the third Business Day following the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the

") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware
Secretary of State_ "), executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with, and accepted by, the Delaware Secretary of State
or at such later date and time as IMS Health and Quintiles shall agree in
writing and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger
becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



2 Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set

debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 1.5 _Charter; Bylaws_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Quintiles
(after giving effect to the Conversion) shall be the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (except that the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall be "Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc.") (the "
_Surviving Corporation Charter_ ") until thereafter amended in accordance with
its terms and as provided by applicable Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of IMS
Health or Quintiles, the bylaws of Quintiles (after giving effect to the
Conversion) shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving

terms, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as
provided by applicable Law.

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers_.

(a) Unless otherwise agreed by IMS Health and Quintiles prior to the Effective
Time, IMS Health and Quintiles shall cause the Board of Directors of the
Surviving Corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation Board_ ") to consist, at

Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation Board shall constitute the
following committees of the Surviving Corporation Board: (i) the Audit
Committee, (ii) the Nominating and Governance Committee and (iii) the
Leadership Development and Compensation Committee. As of the Effective Time,
the charters of the Audit Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee and
Leadership Development and Compensation Committee shall each be in a form
reasonably acceptable to the parties. Each such committee shall consist of two
members of the Surviving Corporation Board designated by IMS Health and two
members of the Surviving Corporation Board designated by Quintiles. The Chairs
of each such committee shall be as follows: (i) the Chair of the Nominating
and Governance Committee shall be designated by Quintiles; (ii) the Chair of
the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee shall be designated by
IMS Health; and (iii) the Chair of the Audit Committee shall be jointly
designated by IMS Health and Quintiles. The parties agree that, in addition
to qualifying as "independent" directors under any applicable rules of the
NYSE, each member of any of these committees shall meet any other applicable
independence standards set forth in the charter of such committee or
contained in applicable rules under the Exchange Act or of the NYSE.

 



3 (c) In accordance with and subject to the Surviving Corporation Bylaws, at the
Effective Time, the officers of the Surviving Corporation shall consist of
the Chief Executive Officer set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto, and the other
officers designated in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section
1.6(c)_ of the IMS Health Disclosure Letter, each until the earlier of his or
her resignation or removal or until his or her successor is duly elected and
qualified. The duties, powers and responsibilities of such officers shall be
as set forth in the Surviving Corporation Bylaws.

foregoing, except as contemplated by the OpCo Merger, the businesses of IMS
Health and its Subsidiaries shall continue to operate under the name "IMS
Health" (or such other name(s) as shall have been utilized), and the
businesses of Quintiles and its Subsidiaries shall continue to operate under
the name "Quintiles" (or such other name(s) as shall have been utilized),
unless and until the Surviving Corporation Board following the Effective Time

Board shall adopt resolutions ratifying the Governance Matters.

 

Section 1.10 _The Conversion_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Plan of Conversion and in
accordance with the DGCL and NCBCA, immediately prior to the Effective Time on
the Closing Date, Quintiles shall consummate the Conversion in accordance with
the Plan of Conversion. For the avoidance of doubt, from and after
the Conversion Effective Time, references herein to "Quintiles" shall include
Quintiles after giving effect to the Conversion (i.e., the "Converted Entity"
as defined in the Plan of Conversion). For federal income tax purposes,
the parties intend for the Conversion to be treated as a "reorganization"
under Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code.

otherwise, immediately following the Effective Time on the Closing Date, the
parties shall cause Quintiles Transnational Corp., a North Carolina
corporation (the " _Quintiles OpCo_ "), to merge (the " _OpCo Merger_ ") with
and into IMS Heath Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the " _IMS Health
OpCo_ "). In connection with the OpCo Merger, (i) all of the outstanding
capital stock of the Quintiles OpCo shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, (ii) all of the outstanding capital stock of IMS Health OpCo shall
remain outstanding and (iii) the separate corporate existence of the Quintiles
OpCo shall cease to exist and the IMS Health OpCo shall continue as the

"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-2(g).

EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE

 

CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE

 

OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of IMS Health, Quintiles or the
holders of any shares of capital stock of IMS Health or Quintiles:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Quintiles ("
_Quintiles Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding (as of the Effective Time, the "
_Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ "). 

(b) Subject to _Section 2.3(f)_, each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of IMS Health (" _IMS Health Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Excluded
Shares), shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable for 0.3840
(the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ ").
As of the Effective Time, all such shares of IMS Health Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and shall thereafter only represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.3(d)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_, in each case
to be issued or paid in accordance with _Section 2.3_, without interest.

 

(c) Each share of IMS Health Common Stock held in treasury or owned, directly
or indirectly, by Quintiles, any of its Subsidiaries or any Subsidiaries of
IMS Health immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, " _Excluded
Shares_ ") shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(d) The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate
effect of any stock split, split-up, reverse stock split, stock dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Quintiles Common Stock or IMS
Health Common Stock, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or
other like change with respect to Quintiles Common Stock or IMS Health Common
Stock having a record date occurring on or after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section
2.1(d)_ shall be construed to permit Quintiles or IMS Health to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

Section 2.2 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each IMS Health Option granted under any of the IMS
Health Equity Plans, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to

 



5  the Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, cease to represent a right
to acquire shares of IMS Health Common Stock and shall be automatically
assumed by the Surviving Corporation and converted under the applicable IMS
Health Equity Plans into an option to acquire shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock (a " _Surviving Corporation Option_ "), on substantially the same
terms and conditions (including any vesting or forfeiture provisions or
repurchase rights, but taking into account any acceleration thereof pursuant
to the existing terms of the relevant IMS Health Equity Plans or applicable
award agreement thereunder by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby)
as were applicable under such IMS Health Option as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, subject to adjustment as provided in this _Section 2.2(a)_;
_provided_ , that any IMS Health Options subject to performance-based vesting
criteria for which the performance period has not yet been completed as of the
Effective Time, shall be converted into Surviving Corporation Options that
vest based upon continued service only, in installments on each anniversary
of the date of grant of such award and in the same number of shares as were
scheduled to vest on each such anniversary under such IMS Health Option. The
number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock subject to each
such Surviving Corporation Option shall be equal to (i) the number of shares
of IMS Health Common Stock subject to each IMS Health Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if
necessary, to the nearest whole share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock,
and such Surviving Corporation Option shall have an exercise price per share
equal to (A) the exercise price per share of IMS Health Common Stock otherwise
purchasable pursuant to such IMS Health Option divided by (B) the Exchange
Ratio, rounded up, if necessary, to the nearest whole cent; _provided_ , that
in the case of any IMS Health Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies
as of the Effective Time (taking into account the effect of any accelerated
vesting thereof pursuant to the existing terms of the relevant IMS Health
Equity Plans or applicable award agreement thereunder by reason of the
transactions contemplated hereby, if applicable) by reason of its
qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number of
shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock subject to such option and the
terms and conditions of such option shall be determined in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the exercise price, the number of shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock subject to, and the terms and conditions of
each Surviving Corporation Option shall also be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

(b) At the Effective Time, each time-based or performance-based IMS Health
RSU, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, be automatically assumed by the
Surviving Corporation and converted under the applicable IMS Health Equity
Plans into a restricted stock unit denominated in shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock (each, a " _Surviving Corporation RSU_ "), on
substantially the same terms and conditions (including any vesting or
forfeiture provisions or repurchase rights, but taking into account any
acceleration or other deemed satisfaction thereof pursuant to the existing
terms of the relevant IMS Health Equity Plans or applicable award
agreement thereunder by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby) as
were applicable under such IMS Health RSU as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, subject to adjustment as provided in this _Section 2.2(b)_.
The number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock subject to each
such Surviving Corporation RSU shall be equal to (i) the number of shares of
IMS Health Common Stock subject to each IMS Health RSU immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if
necessary, to the nearest

 



6  whole share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock; _provided,_ that any
outstanding IMS Health RSUs subject to performance-based vesting criteria for
a performance period that ended prior to or coincident with the Effective
Time shall vest based on the actual performance achieved for the applicable
performance period and any outstanding IMS Health RSUs subject to performance-
based vesting criteria for which the performance period has not yet been
completed as of the Effective Time, shall be converted into Surviving
Corporation RSUs that vest based upon continued service only at the same times
as the expiration of the applicable performance periods under such IMS Health
RSU awards, with respect to a number of shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock, rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole share of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock, determined based on the higher of (x) the
actual performance achieved for the applicable performance period as of the
Effective Time or (y) the target performance level for the applicable
performance period, in each case, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, each award of IMS Health Common Stock subject to
time-based vesting restrictions (each a " _IMS Health Restricted Stock_ "),
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the
Effective Time, be automatically assumed by the Surviving Corporation and
converted under the applicable IMS Health Equity Plans into a
restricted stock award denominated in shares of Surviving Corporation Common
Stock (each a " _Surviving Corporation Restricted Stock_ "), on substantially
the same terms and conditions (including any vesting or forfeiture provisions
or repurchase rights, but taking into account any acceleration or other
deemed satisfaction thereof pursuant to the existing terms of the relevant IMS
Health Equity Plans or applicable award agreement thereunder by reason of the
transactions contemplated hereby) as were applicable under such IMS Health
Restricted Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to
adjustment as provided in this _Section 2.2(c)_. The number of shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock subject to each such Surviving Corporation
Restricted Stock shall be equal to (i) the number of shares of IMS Health
Common Stock subject to each IMS Health Restricted Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if
necessary, to the nearest whole share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock.

(d) At the Effective Time, each IMS Health SAR, whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at the
Effective Time, be automatically assumed by the Surviving Corporation and
converted under the applicable IMS Health Equity Plans into a
stock appreciation right corresponding to shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock (each, a " _Surviving Corporation SAR_ "), on substantially the
same terms and conditions (including any vesting or forfeiture provisions or
repurchase rights, but taking into account any acceleration or other deemed
satisfaction thereof pursuant to the existing terms of the relevant IMS Health
Equity Plans or applicable award agreement thereunder by reason of the
transactions contemplated hereby) as were applicable under such IMS Health
SAR as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to adjustment as
provided in this _Section 2.2(d)_. The number of shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock corresponding to each such Surviving Corporation SAR
shall be equal to (i) the number of shares of IMS Health Common Stock
corresponding to each IMS Health SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the
nearest whole share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock, and the per share
exercise price for each share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock covered by
the Surviving Corporation SAR shall be equal 

 



7  to (A) the exercise price per share of IMS Health Common Stock immediately
before the Effective Time divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio, rounded up, if
necessary, to the nearest whole cent; _provided_ _however_ , that the
exercise price, the number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
covered by the Surviving Corporation SAR and the terms and conditions of each
Surviving Corporation SAR shall be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, IMS Health shall provide such notice, if
any, to the extent required under the terms of the applicable IMS Health
Equity Plans, obtain any necessary consents, waivers or releases, adopt
applicable resolutions, amend the terms of the IMS Health Equity Plans or
any outstanding awards, obtain required shareholder approval with respect to
any such amendment, and take all other appropriate actions to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section 2.2_. At the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall assume the IMS Health Equity Plans, _provided_ , that all
references to "Company" in the applicable IMS Health Equity Plan and the
documents governing the assumed and converted Surviving Corporation Options,
Surviving Corporation RSUs and Surviving Corporation SARs after the Effective
Time shall be deemed references to Surviving Corporation and the number of
shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock available for awards under the
IMS Health Equity Plans shall be determined by adjusting the number of shares
of IMS Health Common Stock available for awards under the IMS Health Equity
Plans immediately before the Effective Time in accordance with the Exchange
Ratio and the provisions of this _Section 2.2_.

 

(f) The Surviving Corporation shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock that will be subject to Surviving
Corporation Options, Surviving Corporation RSUs and Surviving Corporation SARs
as a result of the actions contemplated by this _Section 2.2_. As soon
as practicable following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form
S-8 is not available, other appropriate forms, including Form S-3) with
respect to the shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock subject to such
Surviving Corporation Options, Surviving Corporation RSUs and Surviving
Corporation SARs and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain
the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements
(and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such Surviving Corporation Options, Surviving
Corporation RSUs and Surviving Corporation SARs remain outstanding and are
required to be registered.

Section 2.3 _Exchange and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Quintiles shall appoint a U.S.-based nationally
recognized bank or trust company, which shall be reasonably acceptable to IMS
Health, to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the issuance
and payment of the Merger Consideration to the holders of shares of IMS Health
Common Stock as provided in _Section 2.1_, including any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_ and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to
_Section 2.3(f)_. Quintiles will enter into an exchange agent agreement with
the Exchange Agent (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") on terms reasonably
acceptable to IMS Health and Quintiles prior to the Closing. Prior to or at
the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall deposit (or cause 

 



8  to be deposited) with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of
holders of shares of IMS Health Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than holders to the extent they hold Excluded Shares),
book-entry shares (or certificates if requested) representing the shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ and
cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_. In addition,
the Surviving Corporation shall make available by depositing with the Exchange
Agent, as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, any dividends
or distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_. All certificates
representing shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock, dividends,
distributions and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent are hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall make payments
of the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with this
Agreement and the Exchange Agent Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the third Business Day thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate (" _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented outstanding shares of IMS Health Common Stock that were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_ and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to
_Section 2.3(f)_, (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates held by such holder shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in
customary form and contain such other provisions as IMS Health and Quintiles
may reasonably agree or the Exchange Agent may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent in exchange for the
Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.3(d)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_. Upon surrender
of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange for the shares of IMS Health Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate (other than Excluded Shares) (A) that
number of whole shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock (after taking
into account all shares of IMS Health Common Stock then held by such holder
under all Certificates so surrendered (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof
so delivered)) to which such holder of IMS Health Common Stock shall have
become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ (which shall be in
uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested),
(B) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_
and (C) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common
Stock payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Promptly after the Effective Time
and in any event not later than the third Business Day thereafter, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue and send to
each holder of uncertificated shares of IMS Health Common Stock represented by
book entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), other than with respect to Excluded
Shares, (1) that number of whole shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
to which such holder of Book-Entry Shares shall have become entitled pursuant
to the provisions of _Section 2.1(b) _

 



9  (which shall be in book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested), (2) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.3(d)_ and (3) any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_, without such
holder being required to deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of
transmittal to the Exchange Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any unpaid dividends and
distributions or cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, payable to holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this _Section 2.3_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof, any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_ and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock payable
pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_.

 

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax is not applicable.

(d) (i) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Surviving
Corporation Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares
of Surviving Corporation Common Stock that the holder thereof has the right
to receive upon the surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_, in each case until the holder
thereof shall surrender such Certificate (or deliver an affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) in accordance with this Article II. Following the surrender of a
Certificate (or delivery of an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in
accordance with this Article II, there shall be paid to the record holder
thereof, without interest, (A) promptly after such surrender (or delivery),
the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu
of a fractional share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_ and (B) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender (or delivery) and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender (or delivery) payable with respect
to such whole shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock.

 (ii) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, holders of Book-Entry Shares who are entitled to receive shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock under this Article II shall be paid (A) at the time of payment of such Surviving Corporation Common Stock by the Exchange Agent under _Section 2.3(b)_, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock, and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_ and (B) at the appropriate payment 

 



10  date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to the time of such payment by the Exchange
Agent under _Section 2.3(b)_ and a payment date subsequent to the time of
such payment by the Exchange Agent under _Section 2.3(b)_ payable with
respect to such whole shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock.

 

(e) The Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_
issued and paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of
this Article II shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of IMS Health Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of IMS Health shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares of IMS
Health Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no certificates
representing fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
no dividends or other distributions with respect to the Surviving Corporation
Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any other rights of a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation. In lieu of
the issuance of any such fractional share, the Surviving Corporation shall
pay to each former stockholder of IMS Health who otherwise would be entitled
to receive a fractional share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock an amount
in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the fraction of a
share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock which such holder would otherwise
be entitled to receive (taking into account all shares of IMS Health Common
Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder and rounded to the
nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) pursuant to _Section
2.1(b)_ by (ii) the volume weighted average closing price of one share of
Quintiles Common Stock on the NYSE for the five trading days ending on the
last trading day immediately prior to the date on which the Effective Time
shall occur, as such price is reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape
(as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets or such other source as the
parties shall agree in writing).

 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares twelve (12) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any
remaining holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (except to the extent
representing Excluded Shares) shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration, any unpaid
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_ and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
payable pursuant to  _Section 2.3(f)_ (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar laws), without interest.

 



11 (h) None of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any Person in respect of shares of Surviving Corporation
Common Stock, dividends or other distributions with respect thereto or cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not
have been exchanged prior to such date on which the related Merger
Consideration (and all dividends or other distributions with respect to
shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock pursuant to this
Article II) would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration (and such dividends,
distributions and cash) in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(i) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by the Surviving Corporation. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation.

(j) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
and customary amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate,
the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof, any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(d)_ and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
payable pursuant to _Section 2.3(f)_.

 

Section 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation and the Exchange
Agent shall each be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted
and withheld, from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of shares
of IMS Health Common Stock or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required
to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law, and shall pay over, or cause to be paid over, such deducted
and withheld amounts to the appropriate Governmental Entity. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted and remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made.

Section 3.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements; Internal Controls_.

 

(a) IMS Health has filed with or furnished to the SEC on a timely basis true
and complete copies of all forms, reports, schedules, statements and other
documents required to be filed with or furnished to the SEC by IMS Health
since January 1, 2014 (all such documents, together with all exhibits and
schedules to the foregoing materials and all information incorporated therein
by reference, the " _IMS Health SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective
filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of
this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), the IMS Health SEC Documents
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may
be, including, in each case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
and none of the IMS Health SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



16 (b) The financial statements (including the related notes and schedules
thereto) included (or incorporated by reference) in the IMS Health SEC
Documents (i) have been prepared in a manner consistent with the books and
records of IMS Health and its Subsidiaries, (ii) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), (iii)
comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto and (iv) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of IMS Health and its Subsidiaries as of the
dates thereof and their respective consolidated results of operations and
cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments that were not,
or are not expected to be, material in amount), all in accordance with GAAP
and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Since
December 31, 2015, IMS Health has not made any change in the accounting
practices or policies applied in the preparation of its financial statements,
except as required by GAAP, SEC rule or policy or applicable Law. The books
and records of IMS Health and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being,
maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP (to the extent
applicable) and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and
reflect only actual transactions.

(c) IMS Health has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. IMS Healths
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable
assurance that all material information required to be disclosed by IMS Health
in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to IMS Healths management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. IMS Healths management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of IMS Healths disclosure controls and procedures in
accordance with Rule 13a-15 and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
presented in any applicable IMS Health SEC Document that is a report on Form
10-K or Form 10-Q its conclusions about the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by
such report based on such evaluation. Based on IMS Healths managements most
recently completed evaluation of the IMS Healths internal control over
financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, (i) to the knowledge
of IMS Health, IMS Health had no significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over financial
reporting that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect IMS Healths
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) IMS Health does not have knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
IMS Healths internal control over financial reporting.

(d) To the knowledge of IMS Health, as of the date of this Agreement, there
are no SEC inquiries or investigations, other governmental inquiries or
investigations or internal investigations pending or threatened, in each case
regarding any accounting practices of IMS Health.

 



17 Section 3.7 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither IMS Health nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, and whether or not required to be
recorded or reflected on a balance sheet under GAAP, except (a) to the extent
disclosed, reflected, accrued or reserved against in the audited consolidated
balance sheet of IMS Health and its Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2015
included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by IMS Health with the SEC on
February 19, 2016 (without giving effect to any amendment thereto filed on or
after the date hereof) and (b) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December 31,
2015 that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have an IMS Health Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.8 _Certain Information_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of IMS Health specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is
filed with the SEC, at the time of any amendment or supplement thereto and at
the time it (or any post-effective amendment or supplement) becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading. The Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will not, at the time it is first mailed to IMS Healths
stockholders, at the time of any amendments or supplements thereto and at the
time of the IMS Health Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, IMS Health
makes no representation or warranty with respect to statements included or
incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus based on information supplied in writing by or on behalf
of Quintiles specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

 

Section 3.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2015
through the date of the Agreement: (a) there has not been any change,
occurrence, state of fact, event or development or prospective change, event
or development that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have an IMS Health Material Adverse Effect, and (b)
except as otherwise contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, (i) IMS
Health and its Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in all material
respects only in the ordinary course consistent with past practice; and (ii)
neither IMS Health nor any of its Subsidiaries has suffered any loss, damage,

therefor) pending or, to the knowledge of IMS Health, threatened against or
affecting IMS Health or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets, other than any Action that, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have an
IMS Health Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, neither IMS Health
nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties or assets
is subject to any outstanding judgment, order, injunction, rule or decree of
any Governmental Entity that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have an IMS Health Material Adverse Effect. As
of the date hereof, there is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of IMS
Health, threatened seeking to prevent, hinder, modify, delay or challenge the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



18 Section 3.11 _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

 

(a) IMS Health and each of its Subsidiaries are and, at all times since
January 1, 2013 have been, in compliance with all Laws applicable to their
businesses, operations, properties or assets, including all healthcare Laws,
except where any non-compliance, individually or the aggregate, has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have an IMS Health Material Adverse
Effect. None of IMS Health or any of its Subsidiaries has received, since
January 1, 2013, a notice or other written communication alleging or relating
to a possible material violation of any Law, including any healthcare Law,
applicable to their businesses, operations, properties or assets, which
alleged violation has not been materially resolved and which, individually or
in the aggregate has had or would reasonably be expected to have an IMS Health
Material Adverse Effect. IMS Health and each of its Subsidiaries have in
effect all Permits of all Governmental Entities necessary or advisable for
them to own, lease or operate their properties and assets and to carry on
their businesses as now conducted, except for any Permits the absence of
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have an IMS Health Material Adverse Effect. All such Permits are in full force
and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an IMS
Health Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as, individually
or the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have an
IMS Health Material Adverse Effect, IMS Health (i) does not itself and does
not permit or assist any third party to violate the rights of any Person, or
the contractual obligations of IMS Health or any of its Subsidiaries, with
respect to confidential, personally identifiable or personal health
information, including all Privacy Rights, (ii) has implemented reasonable
technical, physical, and administrative safeguards necessary to protect the
privacy, confidentiality, integrity and security of its software, databases,
systems, networks and internet sites and all information stored or contained
therein or transmitted thereby from unauthorized or improper use, access or
disclosure and (iii) maintains policies and procedures regarding data security
and privacy that are commercially reasonable and, in any event, in
compliance with all of its obligations under applicable Law. There have been
no breaches of either the data privacy policies or the system and data
security policies of IMS Health or any of its Subsidiaries and neither IMS
Health nor any of its Subsidiaries has experienced any data breach that would
violate the Privacy Rights of any Person or any Laws, except, in each case,
for those, individually or in the aggregate, which have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have an IMS Health Material Adverse Effect. The
use, transfer and disclosure of, and access to, any and all data and
information concerning individuals by IMS Health is in compliance with all
applicable IMS Health privacy policies, terms of use, customer agreements and
Law, except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have an IMS Health Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) To the knowledge of IMS Health, neither IMS Health nor any of its
Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, shareholders, officers or employees has,
directly or indirectly, (i) offered to pay to or solicited any remuneration
from, in cash, property or in kind, or made any

 



19  financial arrangements with, any past or present customer, physician, health
care provider, supplier, contractor or third party in order to induce or
directly or indirectly obtain business or payments from such person,
including any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in
part under any federal, state or private health care program, or for

market value payment was made by the recipient) to any past, present or
potential customer, medical director, physician, health care provider,
supplier or potential supplier, contractor or any other person in violation
of any Law, (iii) established or maintained any unrecorded fund or asset for
any illegal purpose or made any false or artificial entries on any of its

has been any intention to make or receive, any payment to any person with the
intention or understanding that any part of such payment would be used for any
purpose other than that described in the documents supporting such payment.

Section 4.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements; Internal Controls_.

 

(a) Quintiles has filed with or furnished to the SEC on a timely basis true

34  filed with or furnished to the SEC by Quintiles since January 1, 2014 (all
such documents, together with all exhibits and schedules to the foregoing
materials and all information incorporated therein by reference, the "
_Quintiles SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective filing dates (or, if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on
the date of such filing), the Quintiles SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, including, in
each case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the
Quintiles SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

thereto) included (or incorporated by reference) in the Quintiles SEC
Documents (i) have been prepared in a manner consistent with the books and
records of Quintiles and its Subsidiaries, (ii) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the

comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto and (iv) fairly present in all material respects the

or are not expected to be, material in amount), all in accordance with GAAP
and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Since
December 31, 2015, Quintiles has not made any change in the accounting
practices or policies applied in the preparation of its financial statements,
except as required by GAAP, SEC rule or policy or applicable Law. The books

maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP (to the extent

procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the

disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable
assurance that all material information required to be disclosed by Quintiles
in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to Quintiles management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Quintiles management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of Quintiles disclosure controls and procedures in accordance
with Rule 13a-15 and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in
any applicable Quintiles SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form
10-Q its conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report based on such
evaluation. Based on Quintiles managements most recently completed
evaluation of Quintiles internal control over financial reporting prior to
the date of

 



35  this Agreement, (i) to the knowledge of Quintiles, Quintiles had no
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
its internal control over financial reporting that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect Quintiles ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial information and (ii) Quintiles does not have knowledge of
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Quintiles internal control over
financial reporting.

balance sheet of Quintiles and its Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2015
included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by Quintiles with the SEC on
February 11, 2016 (without giving effect to any amendment thereto filed on or
after the date hereof) and (b) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December 31,
2015 that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Quintiles Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.8 _Certain Information_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Quintiles specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is
filed with the SEC, at the time of any amendment or supplement thereto and at
the time it (or any post-effective amendment or supplement) becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading. The Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will not, at the time it is first mailed to Quintiles
stockholders, at the time of any amendments or supplements thereto and at the
time of the Quintiles Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Quintiles makes

Section 5.2 _Covenants of Quintiles Regarding No Solicitation; Recommendation
of the Merger_.

(a) Quintiles shall not, and shall not permit or authorize any of its
Subsidiaries or any director, officer, employee, investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of Quintiles or any of its Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate, endorse, knowingly
encourage (including by way of furnishing information) or take any action to
knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to, or the
making or completion of, any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) other than to inform any Person of the existence of the
provisions contained in this _Section 5.2_, enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any information or data with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any
way with, any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) resolve, agree or propose to do
any of the foregoing. Quintiles shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries and the Representatives of Quintiles and its Subsidiaries to, (A)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions and
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and immediately
terminate all physical

 



55  and electronic data room access previously granted to any such Person, (B)
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential
Acquisition Proposal, and (C) not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify
any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives is a party with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal, and shall enforce the
provisions of any such agreement, which shall include seeking any injunctive
relief available to enforce such agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining
the Quintiles Stockholder Approval, (1) Quintiles receives a written
Acquisition Proposal that the Quintiles Board believes in good faith to be
bona fide, (2) such Acquisition Proposal was unsolicited and did not
otherwise result from a material breach of this _Section 5.2,_ (3) the
Quintiles Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (4) the
Quintiles Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that the failure to take the actions referred to in clause (x) or
(y) below would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders
of Quintiles under applicable Law, then Quintiles may (x) furnish information
with respect to Quintiles and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
containing terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to the
disclosing party than, those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement
(excluding any standstill agreement contained therein) (an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ "); _provided_ , that (I) Quintiles shall provide
IMS Health a non-redacted copy of each confidentiality agreement Quintiles has
executed in accordance with this _Section 5.2_ and (II) that any non-public
information provided to any such Person shall have been previously provided to
IMS Health or shall be provided to IMS Health prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person, and (y) participate
in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal. Quintiles shall not provide (and
shall not permit any of its Representatives to provide) any commercially or
competitively sensitive non-public information in connection with the actions
permitted by this _Section 5.2(a)_, except in accordance with "clean room" or
other similar procedures designed to limit any adverse effect of the sharing
of such information on Quintiles, which procedures shall be consistent in all
material respects with Quintiles practices in dealing with the disclosures of
such information to IMS Health or its Representatives.

(b) Neither the Quintiles Board nor any committee thereof shall:

 

(i) (A) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify
or modify, or fail to make, in each case in a manner adverse to IMS Health,
the approval or recommendation by such Quintiles Board or such committee of
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (B)
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, to the
Quintiles stockholders of any Acquisition Proposal, or (C) resolve or agree to
take any such actions (each such action set forth in this _Section 5.2(b)(i)_
being referred to herein as a " _Quintiles Adverse Recommendation Change_ ");
or

 



56 (ii) except as expressly contemplated by _Section 7.1(d)(iii)_, cause or
permit Quintiles or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other Contract, except for an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, in each case constituting or related to, or which
is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal
(each, an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), or resolve, agree or
propose to take any such actions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Quintiles
Stockholder Approval, the Quintiles Board may, if the Quintiles Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of Quintiles under applicable Law, taking into account all
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by IMS Health
pursuant to this _Section 5.2_, make a Quintiles Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to either (x) a Superior Proposal or (y) an Intervening
Event; _provided_ , _however_ , that Quintiles may not make a Quintiles
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal unless:

 

(A) Quintiles notifies IMS Health in writing at least four (4) Business Days
before taking that action of its intention to do so, and specifies the
reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of
the Person making, such Superior Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishes a
copy (if any) of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any
other relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notice by Quintiles and an additional two
(2) Business Day period); and

(B) if IMS Health makes a proposal during such period to adjust the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Quintiles Board, after taking into
consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as proposed
by IMS Health, continues to determine in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Superior Proposal
continues to be a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make a Quintiles
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
to the stockholders of Quintiles under applicable Law; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that the Quintiles Board may not make a Quintiles Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event unless:

 

(1) Quintiles provides IMS Health with written information describing such
Intervening Event in reasonable detail;

 

(2) Quintiles keeps IMS Health reasonably informed of developments with
respect to such Intervening Event;

 

(3) Quintiles notifies IMS Health in writing at least four (4) Business Days
before making a Quintiles Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such
Intervening Event of its intention to do so and specifies the reasons
therefor; and

(4) if IMS Health makes a proposal during such period to adjust the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Quintiles Board, after taking into
consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as proposed
by IMS Health, 

 



57  continues to determine in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel) that the failure to make such Quintiles Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
Quintiles under applicable Law.

During the period prior to its effecting a Quintiles Adverse Recommendation
Change as referred to above, Quintiles shall, and shall cause its financial
and legal advisors to, negotiate with IMS Health in good faith (to the extent
IMS Health seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by IMS Health.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither Quintiles
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any Alternative Acquisition
Agreement or submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal
(other than the Merger) unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Quintiles set forth in _Section
5.2(a)_ and _Section 5.2(b)_, Quintiles promptly (and in any event within 24
hours of receipt) shall advise IMS Health in writing in the event Quintiles or
any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any inquiry or
request for information, discussion or negotiation that is reasonably likely
to lead to or that contemplates an Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) any proposal
or offer that is or is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
in each case together with a description of the material terms and conditions
of and facts surrounding any such indication, inquiry, request, proposal or
offer, the identity of the Person making any such indication, inquiry,
request, proposal or offer, and a copy of any written proposal, offer or draft
agreement provided by such Person. Quintiles shall keep IMS Health informed in
all material respects on a timely basis of the status and details of any such
Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry, proposal or offer, including
furnishing copies of any written inquiries, correspondence and draft
documentation. Without limiting any of the foregoing, Quintiles shall promptly
(and in any event within 24 hours) notify IMS Health orally and in writing if
it determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to _Section 5.2(a)_
or  _Section 5.2(b)_ and shall in no event begin providing such information
or engaging in such discussions or negotiations prior to providing such
notice.

 

(d) Quintiles agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 5.2_ by any Representative of Quintiles or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of Quintiles or any
of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Agreement by Quintiles.

 

(e) Quintiles shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that would restrict Quintiles ability to comply with any of the
terms of this _Section 5.2_, and represents that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any such agreement.

 

(f) Quintiles shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than IMS
Health and its respective Affiliates) from the restrictions on "business
combinations" contained in The North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act
(NCBCA Art. 9) or The North Carolina Control Share Acquisition Act (NCBCA Art.
9A) (or any similar provision of any other Takeover Law or the
Quintiles Charter or the Quintiles Bylaws) or otherwise cause such
restrictions not to apply, or agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms
(including the payment of the Quintiles Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
7.3(b)_, if applicable).

 



58 (g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Quintiles or the
Quintiles Board from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
(ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Quintiles Board has
reasonably determined in good faith after consultation with Quintiles
outside legal counsel that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the
duties of the members of the Quintiles Board under applicable Law; _provided_
, that this _Section 5.2(g)_ shall not permit the Quintiles Board to make a
Quintiles Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent permitted by
_Section 5.2(b)_.

 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means, with respect to any party, any proposal
or offer with respect to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in
one transaction or a series of transactions, and whether through any merger,

completed fiscal quarter) or that represent 15% or more of the total assets
(based on fair market value) of such party and its respective Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or (B) 15% or more

good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial
advisor), taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal, is (A) more
favorable to the stockholders of the applicable party from a financial point
of view than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by
the other party in response to such proposal) and (B) reasonably likely of
being completed on the terms proposed on a timely basis; _provided_ , that,
for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," references in the term
"Acquisition Proposal" to "15%" shall be deemed to be references to "50%";
and 

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means a material Effect that was not known to,
or reasonably foreseeable by, the Quintiles Board or the IMS Health Board, as
applicable, prior to the execution of this Agreement (or if known or
reasonably foreseeable, the material consequences of which were not known or
reasonably foreseeable), which Effect, or any material consequence thereof,
becomes known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Quintiles Board or the IMS
Health Board, as applicable, prior to the receipt of the Quintiles Stockholder
Approval or the IMS Health Stockholder Approval, as applicable, and that does
not relate to

 



59  (A) an Acquisition Proposal or (B) any changes in the market price or
trading volume of IMS Health Common Stock or Quintiles Common Stock, in and of
itself (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise or
contributing to such change may be taken into account when determining an
Intervening Event).

 

Section 5.3 _Covenants of IMS Health Regarding No Solicitation; Recommendation
of the Merger_.

 

(a) IMS Health shall not, and shall not permit or authorize any of its
Subsidiaries or any Representatives of IMS Health or any of its Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate, endorse, knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing information) or take any action to knowingly
facilitate any inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to, or the making or
completion of, any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or offer
that is reasonably likely to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) other than
to inform any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this 
_Section 5.3_, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information or data with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with,
any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) resolve, agree or propose to do any of the
foregoing. IMS Health shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and the
Representatives of IMS Health and its Subsidiaries to, (A) immediately cease
and cause to be terminated all existing discussions and negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
potential Acquisition Proposal and immediately terminate all physical and
electronic data room access previously granted to any such Person, (B)
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential
Acquisition Proposal, and (C) not terminate, waive, amend, release or modify
any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives is a party with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal, and shall enforce the
provisions of any such agreement, which shall include seeking any injunctive
relief available to enforce such agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
IMS Health Stockholder Approval, (1) IMS Health receives a written
Acquisition Proposal that the IMS Health Board believes in good faith to be
bona fide, (2) such Acquisition Proposal was unsolicited and did not otherwise
result from a material breach of this  _Section 5.3_, (3) the IMS Health
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and
its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (4) the IMS Health
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that
the failure to take the actions referred to in clause (x) or (y) below would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of IMS Health
under applicable Law, then IMS Health may (x) furnish information with respect
to IMS Health and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement;  _provided_ ,
that (I) IMS Health shall provide Quintiles a non-redacted copy of each
confidentiality agreement IMS Health has executed in accordance with this
_Section 5.3_ and (II) that any non-public information provided to any such
Person shall have been previously provided to Quintiles or shall be provided
to Quintiles prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is
provided to such Person, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition
Proposal. IMS Health shall not provide (and shall not permit any of its
Representatives to provide) any commercially or competitively sensitive non-
public information 

 



60  in connection with the actions permitted by this _Section 5.3(a)_, except
in accordance with "clean room" or other similar procedures designed to limit
any adverse effect of the sharing of such information on IMS Health, which
procedures shall be consistent in all material respects with IMS Healths
practices in dealing with the disclosures of such information to Quintiles or
its Representatives.

 

(b) Neither the IMS Health Board nor any committee thereof shall:

 

(i) (A) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify
or modify, or fail to make, in each case in a manner adverse to Quintiles,
the approval or recommendation by such IMS Health Board or such committee of
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (B)
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, to the IMS
Health stockholders of any Acquisition Proposal, or (C) resolve, or agree to
take any such actions (each such action set forth in this _Section 5.3(b)(i)_
being referred to herein as an " _IMS Health Adverse Recommendation Change_
"); or

(ii) except as contemplated by _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_, cause or permit IMS
Health or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, or resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the IMS Health
Stockholder Approval, the IMS Health Board may, if the IMS Health Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of IMS Health under applicable Law, taking into account all
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by Quintiles
pursuant to this _Section 5.3_, make an IMS Health Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to either (x) a Superior Proposal or (y) an Intervening
Event; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that IMS Health may not make an IMS Health
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal unless:

(A) IMS Health notifies Quintiles in writing at least four (4) Business Days
before taking that action of its intention to do so, and specifies the reasons
therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the
Person making, such Superior Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishes a copy
(if any) of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other
relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notice by IMS Health and an additional
two (2) Business Day period); and

 

(B) if Quintiles makes a proposal during such period to adjust the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the IMS Health Board, after taking into
consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as proposed
by Quintiles, continues to determine in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Superior Proposal
continues to be a Superior Proposal and that the failure to make an IMS
Health Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of IMS Health under applicable Law; _provided_
_further_ , that the IMS Health Board may not make an IMS Health Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event unless:

(1) IMS Health provides Quintiles with written information describing such
Intervening Event in reasonable detail;

 



61 (2) IMS Health keeps Quintiles reasonably informed of developments with
respect to such Intervening Event;

(3) IMS Health notifies Quintiles in writing at least four (4) Business Days
before making an IMS Health Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to
such Intervening Event of its intention to do so and specifies the reasons
therefor; and

(4) if Quintiles makes a proposal during such period to adjust the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the IMS Health Board, after taking into
consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as proposed
by Quintiles, continues to determine in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel) that the failure to make such IMS Health Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of IMS Health under applicable Law.

 

During the period prior to its effecting an IMS Health Adverse Recommendation
Change as referred to above, IMS Health shall, and shall cause its financial
and legal advisors to, negotiate with Quintiles in good faith (to the extent
Quintiles seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Quintiles.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, neither IMS Health
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any Alternative Acquisition
Agreement or submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms.

(c) In addition to the obligations of IMS Health set forth in _Section
5.3(a)_ and  _Section 5.3(b)_, IMS Health promptly (and in any event within
24 hours of receipt) shall advise Quintiles in writing in the event IMS Health
or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any inquiry or
request for information, discussion or negotiation that is reasonably likely
to lead to or that contemplates an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) any proposal
or offer that is or is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
in each case together with a description of the material terms and conditions
of and facts surrounding any such indication, inquiry, request, proposal or
offer, the identity of the Person making any such indication, inquiry,
request, proposal or offer, and a copy of any written proposal, offer or
draft agreement provided by such Person. IMS Health shall keep Quintiles
informed in all material respects on a timely basis of the status and details
of any such Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry, proposal or
offer, including furnishing copies of any written inquiries, correspondence
and draft documentation. Without limiting any of the foregoing, IMS Health
shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Quintiles orally and
in writing if it determines to begin providing information or to engage in
discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
_Section 5.3(a)_ or _Section 5.3(b)_ and shall in no event begin providing
such information or engaging in such discussions or negotiations prior to
providing such notice.

 



62 (d) IMS Health agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this  _Section 5.3_ by any Representative of IMS Health or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of IMS
Health or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach
of this Agreement by IMS Health.

(e) IMS Health shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that would restrict IMS Healths ability to comply with any of the
terms of this _Section 5.3_, and represents that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any such agreement.

(f) IMS Health shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than
Quintiles and its respective Affiliates) from the restrictions on "business
combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar provision
of any other Takeover Law or the IMS Health Charter or the IMS Health Bylaws)
or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, or agree to do any of the
foregoing, in each case unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms (including the payment of the IMS Health Termination
Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(c)_, if applicable).

 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit IMS Health or the IMS
Health Board from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making
any disclosure to its stockholders if the Quintiles Board has reasonably
determined in good faith after consultation with IMS Healths outside legal
counsel that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the duties of the
members of the IMS Health Board under applicable Law; _provided_ , that this
_Section 5.3(g)_ shall not permit the IMS Health Board to make an IMS Health
Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent permitted by _Section
5.3(b)_.

Section 5.4 _Preparation of Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus; Stockholders Meetings_.

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, IMS Health
and Quintiles shall jointly prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC a proxy
statement (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus_ ") with respect to the special meeting of IMS Healths
stockholders (the " _IMS Health Stockholders Meeting_ ") and the special
meeting of Quintiles stockholders (the " _Quintiles Stockholders Meeting_ ").
As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Quintiles
shall prepare (with IMS Healths reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC
a registration statement on Form S-4 (as amended or supplemented from time to
time, the " _Form S-4_ "), in which the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will
be included as a prospectus, in connection with the registration under the
Securities Act of the Surviving Corporation Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger. Quintiles shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
such filing and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Quintiles shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do
business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or filing a
general consent to service of process) required to be taken under any
applicable state securities or "blue sky" laws in connection with the
issuance of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock in the

 



63  Merger. Each of Quintiles and IMS Health shall furnish all information
concerning Quintiles and the holders of Quintiles Common Stock and IMS Health
and the holders of IMS Health Common Stock, as applicable, as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action. Each of Quintiles and
IMS Health shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to Quintiles stockholders and IMS Healths
stockholders, as applicable, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act.

 

(b) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by IMS Health or Quintiles, as
applicable, without providing the other a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon and without the others prior approval (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld). IMS Health or Quintiles, as applicable, will advise
the other promptly after it receives oral or written notice thereof, of the
time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any amendment or supplement
thereto has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Surviving Corporation Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction or any
oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly
provide the other with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any
state securities commission and a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the responses thereto. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to Quintiles or IMS Health, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Quintiles or IMS
Health that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the
Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such
documents would not contain any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties
hereto and Quintiles and IMS Health shall cooperate in the prompt filing
with the SEC of an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information and, to the extent required under applicable Law, in disseminating
the information contained in such amendment or supplement to Quintiles
stockholders and IMS Healths stockholders; _provided_ , that the delivery of
such notice and the filing of any such amendment or supplement shall not
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by any party
hereunder or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any party.

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under
the Securities Act, Quintiles shall duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold the Quintiles Stockholders Meeting solely for the purpose of obtaining
the Quintiles Stockholder Approval, any other matters required under
applicable Law to be considered at the Quintiles Stockholders Meeting, the
advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection
therewith, if applicable, and to adjourn the Quintiles Stockholders Meeting,
if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not
sufficient votes to approve the other proposals. Such Quintiles Stockholders
Meeting shall in any event be no later than sixty (60) calendar days after (i)
the tenth (10th) calendar day after the preliminary Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus therefor has been filed with the SEC if by such date the
SEC has not informed Quintiles that it intends to review the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or (ii) if the SEC has, by the tenth (10th) calendar day
after the preliminary Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus

 



64  therefor has been filed with the SEC, informed Quintiles that it intends to
review the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the date on which the SEC
confirms that it has no further comments on the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Quintiles may postpone or adjourn the Quintiles
Stockholders Meeting solely (i) with the consent of IMS Health; (ii) (A) due
to the absence of a quorum or (B) if Quintiles has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares for the Quintiles Stockholder
Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, to solicit additional proxies;
or (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of
any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Quintiles Board has
determined in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel is
necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure
to be disseminated and reviewed by Quintiles stockholders prior to the
Quintiles Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , that Quintiles may not postpone
or adjourn the Quintiles Stockholders Meeting more than a total of two times
pursuant to clause (ii)(A) and/or clause (ii)(B) of this _Section 5.4(c)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Quintiles shall, at the request of IMS Health,
to the extent permitted by Law, adjourn the Quintiles Stockholders Meeting to
a date specified by IMS Health for the absence of a quorum or if Quintiles
has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares for the
Quintiles Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that Quintiles shall not be
required to adjourn the Quintiles Stockholders Meeting more than two times
pursuant to this sentence, and no such adjournment pursuant to this sentence
shall be required to be for a period exceeding fifteen (15) Business Days.
Except in the case of a Quintiles Adverse Recommendation Change specifically
permitted by _Section 5.2(b)_, Quintiles, through the Quintiles Board, shall
(i) recommend to its stockholders that they adopt this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Quintiles Recommendation_ ")
and (ii) include the Quintiles Recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus.

(d) As promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under
the Securities Act, IMS Health shall duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold the IMS Health Stockholders Meeting solely for the purpose of obtaining
the IMS Health Stockholder Approval, any other matters required under
applicable Law to be considered at the IMS Health Stockholders Meeting, the
advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection
therewith, if applicable, and to adjourn the IMS Health Stockholders Meeting,
if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are not
sufficient votes to approve the other proposals. Such IMS Health Stockholders
Meeting shall in any event be no later than sixty (60) calendar days after (i)
the tenth (10th) calendar day after the preliminary Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus therefor has been filed with the SEC if by such date the
SEC has not informed IMS Health that it intends to review the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or (ii) if the SEC has, by the tenth (10th) calendar day
after the preliminary Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus therefor has been filed
with the SEC, informed IMS Health that it intends to review the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the date on which the SEC confirms that it has no
further comments on the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus. IMS Health may
postpone or adjourn the IMS Health Stockholders Meeting solely (i) with the
consent of Quintiles; (ii) (A) due to the absence of a quorum or (B) if IMS
Health has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares for
the IMS Health Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, to
solicit additional proxies; or (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for
the filing and mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the IMS
Health Board has determined in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental
or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by IMS Healths
stockholders prior to the IMS Health Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , that
IMS Health may not

 



65  postpone or adjourn the IMS Health Stockholders Meeting more than a total of
two times pursuant to clause (ii)(A) and/or clause (ii)(B) of this _Section
5.4(d)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, IMS Health shall, at the request of
Quintiles, to the extent permitted by Law, adjourn the IMS Health Stockholders
Meeting to a date specified by Quintiles for the absence of a quorum or if IMS
Health has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares
for the IMS Health Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that IMS Health shall
not be required to adjourn the IMS Health Stockholders Meeting more than two
times pursuant to this sentence, and no such adjournment pursuant to this
sentence shall be required to be for a period exceeding fifteen (15) Business
Days. Except in the case of an IMS Health Adverse Recommendation Change
specifically permitted by _Section 5.3(b)_, IMS Health, through the IMS
Health Board, shall (i) recommend to its stockholders that they adopt this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _IMS Health
Recommendation_ ") and (ii) include the IMS Health Recommendation in
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.

(e) IMS Health and Quintiles shall use reasonable best efforts to hold the IMS
Health Stockholders Meeting and the Quintiles Stockholders Meeting on the
same date.

Section 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice, Quintiles and IMS
Health shall each, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries, officers, directors and representative to,
afford to the other reasonable access during normal business hours, consistent
with applicable Law, to each of its respective officers, employees,
properties, offices, other facilities and books and records, and shall furnish
the other with all financial, operating and other data and information as the
other shall reasonably request in writing (it being agreed, however, that the
foregoing shall not permit the other or its respective officers, employees or
representatives to conduct any environmental testing or sampling, including
but not limited to facility surface and subsurface soils and water, air or
building materials). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or
consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business or operations of the other party or its
Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the
prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the other party of their
normal duties. Neither party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would (i) breach any agreement with any third-party, (ii) constitute a waiver
of or jeopardize the attorney-client or other privilege held by such party or
(iii) otherwise violate any applicable Law, including any Antitrust Law.

(b) The parties will hold and treat and will cause its
respective Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and
information concerning the other furnished to each other in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated December 18, 2015, between IMS Health and
Quintiles (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
In addition, notwithstanding anything herein or in the Confidentiality
Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees that IMS Health shall be
permitted to disclose information to the Debt Financing Sources, rating
agencies and/or prospective lenders or purchasers, subject to such
Debt Financing Sources, ratings agencies and/or prospective lenders or
purchasers being informed of the confidential nature of such information.

 



66 Section 5.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) obtain all
required consents, approvals or waivers from, or participation in other
discussions or negotiations with, third parties, including as required under
any Quintiles Material Contract or IMS Health Material Contract, as
applicable, (ii) obtain all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities,
make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with and make all
reasonable best efforts to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid any
Action by, any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement required
under applicable Law, including the HSR Act and any other
applicable Antitrust Laws and (iii) execute and deliver any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
fully to carry out the purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Quintiles, IMS Health nor any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall commit to the payment of any fee, penalty or other consideration or make
any other concession, waiver or amendment under any Contract in connection
with obtaining any consent without the prior written consent of the other
party.

(b) Quintiles and IMS Health agree to make, and to cause their respective
Affiliates to make, any necessary filings under the HSR Act and any other
Antitrust Laws as soon as reasonably practicable after execution of this
Agreement. Quintiles and IMS Health shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, comply at the earliest practicable date with any request under
the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws to provide information, documents or
other materials requested by any Governmental Entity.

 

(c) Quintiles and IMS Health shall each request early termination of the
waiting period provided for in the HSR Act. Quintiles and IMS Health shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, coordinate and cooperate in
connection with their respective efforts to obtain termination or expiration
of the applicable waiting period and all requisite clearances and approvals
under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable and
in any event before the Outside Date. In connection with any investigation or
other inquiry, Quintiles and IMS Health shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, unless prohibited by applicable Law or a
Governmental Entity, (i) keep the other party promptly informed of any
communication received by such party or any of its Affiliates from any
Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and (ii) provide outside counsel for the other party with a reasonable
opportunity to (A) review in advance any proposed communication by such party
or its Affiliates with any Governmental Entity, (B) consult with the
other party prior to any meeting or conference with any Governmental Entity,
and (C) attend and participate in such meetings or conferences. Without the
prior written consent of the other party, Quintiles and IMS Health will not,
and will not permit their respective Affiliates to consent or agree to extend
the waiting period under the HSR Act or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



67 (d) Each of Quintiles and IMS Health may, as each deems advisable and
necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided
to the other under this _Section 5.6_ as "outside counsel only." Such
competitively sensitive material and the information contained therein shall
be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from Quintiles or
IMS Health, as the case may be, or its legal counsel.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 5.6_, Quintiles and IMS Health shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, to resolve such objections, if any, as any Governmental Entity
may assert under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment and avoid the institution of any Action under any such
Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case so as to enable the
Merger to occur as promptly as possible and in any event before the Outside
Date, including by (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of any assets or businesses of Quintiles or its Subsidiaries or
IMS Health or its Subsidiaries, (ii) terminating existing, or creating new,
relationships, contractual rights or obligations of Quintiles or its
Subsidiaries or IMS Health or its Subsidiaries or (iii) effectuating any
other change or restructuring of Quintiles or its Subsidiaries or IMS Health
or its Subsidiaries or otherwise taking or committing to take any actions that
limit the freedom of action of Quintiles or its Subsidiaries or IMS Health or
its Subsidiaries with respect to, or ability to retain, one or more assets or
businesses, to ensure that no Governmental Entity enters any temporary
restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment,
order or decree or establishes any Law preliminarily or permanently
restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or to ensure that no Governmental Entity with
the authority to authorize or approve such consummation fails to do so as
promptly as practicable and in any event before the Outside Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no such remedy shall be (A) required unless contingent upon the
occurrence of the Merger, (B) proposed, agreed to or effected by Quintiles or
its Subsidiaries or IMS Health or its Subsidiaries without the prior written
consent of the other party or (C) required to be agreed to by Quintiles or
its Subsidiaries or IMS Health or its Subsidiaries if, in the reasonable
opinion of either party, such remedy would have a material adverse effect on
the business, results of operations or financial condition of Quintiles, IMS
Health and their Subsidiaries (taken as a whole, after giving effect to the
Merger).

(f) Each of Quintiles and IMS Health shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to vigorously
contest and resist any Action, including any administrative or judicial
Action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any temporary
restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other

 



68  judgment, order or decree that is threatened or in effect and that
restricts, prevents or prohibits consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws, including by
vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial
appeal; _provided_ , _however_ , that such obligation to contest and resist
any Action in no way limits the obligation of Quintiles and IMS Health to,
and to cause their Affiliates to, take, or cause to be taken, all other
actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable and in any event before the Outside
Date in accordance with

clearances and approvals under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws as
promptly as practicable and in any event before the Outside Date; and (ii)
avoid the entry of, the commencement of any Action seeking the entry of, or

Section 5.7 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall assume
sponsorship of and maintain the IMS Health Plans sponsored and maintained by
IMS Health immediately prior to the Closing Date (" _IMS Health Benefit Plans_
") under which each employee of IMS Health and its Subsidiaries who is
employed immediately prior to the Closing and who continues employment with
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries thereafter (each such
employee, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") will continue to participate on and
after the Closing Date. If after Closing a Continuing Employee becomes
eligible to participate in an employee benefit plan, program or policy of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (" _Surviving Corporation
Benefit Plans_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable Surviving
Corporation Benefit Plan, to provide such Continuing Employee with credit for
all service with IMS Health or its Subsidiaries as if such service were with
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining
eligibility, vesting, and level of benefits under Surviving Corporation
Benefit Plans that provide severance, vacation and other benefits determined
by the Surviving Corporation, but not benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plan. Unused vacation days accrued by Continuing Employees
under the plans and policies of IMS Health and its Subsidiaries shall carry
over to the Surviving Corporation. This _Section 5.7(a)_ shall not
operate to duplicate any benefit provided to any Continuing Employee under an
IMS Health Benefit Plan or prohibit the termination of employment of any
specific employee following the Effective Time.

 



69 (b) Nothing contained herein, express or implied shall (i) be construed to
establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement, policy or
arrangement or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation,
IMS Health, Quintiles or any of their respective affiliates to amend, modify
or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement, policy or arrangement at
any time assumed, established, sponsored or maintained by any of them. This
_Section 5.7_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 5.7_, express
or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 5.7_.

 

Section 5.8 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby, each of Quintiles and IMS Health and their respective Board of
Directors shall take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Quintiles and IMS Health shall
promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any other notice or communication from
any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, (c) any Action commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such
party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the transactions contemplated
hereby or (d) any change, condition or event (i) that renders or would
reasonably be expected to render any representation or warranty of such party
set forth in this Agreement (disregarding any materiality qualification
contained therein) to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii)
that results or would reasonably be expected to result in any failure of such
party to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement (including any condition set forth in Article VI) to be
complied with or satisfied hereunder; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such
notification shall affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
rights or remedies, or the conditions to the obligations of, the parties
hereunder; _provided_ , _further_ , that failure to give prompt notice
pursuant to clause (d) shall not constitute a failure of a condition to the
Merger set forth in Article VI except to the extent that the underlying fact
or circumstance not so notified would, standing alone, constitute such
a failure. The parties agree and acknowledge that neither Quintiles nor IMS
Healths compliance or failure of compliance with this _Section 5.9_ shall be
taken into account for purposes of determining whether the
conditions referred to in _Section 6.2(b)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ shall have
been satisfied.

Section 5.10 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any agreement or IMS Health Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of the
Effective Time) and former officer, director or employee of IMS Health and
its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses,
liabilities,

 



70  damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and
expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection
with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or
was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of IMS Health or any of
its Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. In the
event of any such Action, (A) each Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any Action from the
Surviving Corporation to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law
within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Surviving Corporation from
the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ , that any Person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent
required by applicable Law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification, (B) the
Surviving Corporation shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or claim (and in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim
or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (C) the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

 

(b) Except as may be required by applicable Law, IMS Health and Quintiles
agree that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
(or comparable organizational documents) of IMS Health and its Subsidiaries
or in any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and IMS
Health or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and continue in
full force and effect, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any
such Indemnified Party.

 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall either cause to be maintained in effect the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance maintained by IMS Health and its Subsidiaries or
provide substitute policies or purchase a "tail policy," in any case of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are
not less advantageous in the aggregate than such policy with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year
annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by IMS
Health prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be
obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
Surviving Corporation purchases a "tail policy" and the coverage thereunder
costs more than 300% of such last annual premium, the Surviving Corporation
shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained for 300% of
such last annual premium. At IMS Healths option, IMS Health may purchase,
prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and
conditions (in both amount and scope) providing substantially equivalent

 



71  benefits as the current policies of directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by IMS Health and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time,
covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year
annual premiums shall not exceed 300% of the last annual premium paid by IMS
Health prior to the date hereof. If such tail prepaid policy has been obtained
by IMS Health prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full
term, and shall honor all obligations thereunder.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is instituted against any
Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
the provisions of this _Section 5.10_ shall continue in effect until the
final disposition of such Action.

(e) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_.

 

Section 5.11 _Delisting_. Each of IMS Health and Quintiles agrees to cooperate
with the other party in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary

termination shall not be effective until after the Effective Time.

Stock to be reserved for issuance in connection with the Merger, to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Effective Time.

Section 5.13 _Stockholder Litigation_. Quintiles shall give IMS Health the
opportunity to participate in (but not control) the defense and settlement of
any stockholder litigation against Quintiles and/or its officers or directors,
and IMS Health shall give Quintiles the opportunity to participate in (but not
control) the defense and settlement of any stockholder litigation against IMS
Health and/or its officers or directors, in each case relating to the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of a mutually agreed upon joint defense agreement. Neither
Quintiles nor IMS Health shall enter into any settlement agreement in respect
of any stockholder litigation against it and/or its directors or officers
relating to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby without the other partys prior written consent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



72 Section 5.14 _Director Resignations_.

 

(a) IMS Health shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered

Section 5.15 _Certain Tax Matters_. Quintiles and IMS Health each agrees to
(i) not, and to not permit any of their Subsidiaries to, take or cause to be
taken any action on or before the Effective Time, which would reasonably be
expected to disqualify the Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) file (and agree to cause their respective
Subsidiaries to file) all Tax Returns consistent with the treatment of the
Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release, Financing
Disclosure or other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any
such press release, Financing Disclosure or make any public announcement
prior to such consultation and review, except as may be required by applicable
Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system. The
initial press release of the parties announcing the execution of this
Agreement shall be a joint press release of IMS Health and Quintiles in a form
that is mutually agreed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) any such press

statement has used its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other
party, (b) the first sentence of this _Section 5.16_ shall not apply with
respect to a Quintiles Adverse Recommendation Change (or any
responses thereto) or an IMS Health Adverse Recommendation Change (or any

sentence of this _Section 5.16_ shall not apply to any public statement
regarding the transactions contemplated hereby in response to questions from
the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, or to

consent of Quintiles, (i) enter into any amendment, replacement, supplement or

reasonably be expected to prevent, delay or impede in any material respect the
consummation of all or a portion of the Debt Financing or the Merger and (C)
does not adversely change in any material respect or impose new or additional
conditions or otherwise expand or adversely amend in any material respect any

[SIGNATURE PAGE TO AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER] Exhibit A

 

PLAN OF CONVERSION

This Plan of Conversion (this " _Plan of Conversion_ "), dated as of May 3,
2016, provides for the conversion of Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc., a
North Carolina corporation (the " _Converting Corporation_ "), into Quintiles
Transnational Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Converted
Corporation_ "), pursuant to Sections 55-11A-10 through 55-11A-13 of the North
Carolina Business Corporation Act (the "NCBCA") and Section 265 of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ").

WHEREAS, concurrently herewith, the Converting Corporation and IMS Health are
entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger Agreement_ ";
capitalized terms used but not defined in this Plan of Conversion shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement), pursuant to which
(and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein) IMS
Health will be merged with and into the Converting Corporation, with the
Converting Corporation continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger
(the " _Merger_ ");

WHEREAS, the parties intend for (i) the Conversion (as defined below) to be
treated as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code, and
(ii) this Plan of Conversion to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g); and

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Quintiles has approved the Plan of
Conversion and the Conversion (as defined below) in accordance with the NCBCA
and the DGCL and determined that the Conversion is advisable;

NOW, THEREFORE, the Converting Corporation hereby approves this Plan of
Conversion and agrees as follows:

1\. _Conversion and Continuing Existence_. Immediately prior to the Effective
Time on the Closing Date, in accordance with this Plan of Conversion, the
NCBCA and the DGCL, the Converting Corporation shall convert into a Delaware
corporation, with the Converted Corporation as the resulting corporation
(the " _Conversion_ "), and the existence of the Converting Corporation shall
continue in the organizational form of the Converted Corporation. The
Converted Corporation shall be incorporated, formed and organized as a
Delaware corporation pursuant to the DGCL.

2\. _Conditions_. The Conversion shall be conditioned upon this Plan of
Conversion being approved by the stockholders of the Converting Corporation
in accordance with the requirements of the NCBCA and the DGCL, which approval
shall be obtained as part of the Quintiles Stockholder Approval.

 

3\. _Conversion Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Plan of Conversion, immediately prior to the Effective Time on the
Closing Date, the parties shall cause the Conversion to be consummated by
filing (a) a certificate of conversion (the " _Certificate of Conversion_ ")
and certificate of incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State,
meeting the requirements of, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, and (b) articles of conversion (the " _Articles of
Conversion_ ") with the North Carolina Secretary of State, meeting the
requirements of, and executed in accordance with, the relevant  provisions of the NCBCA. The Conversion shall become effective at the later
of the time the Certificate of Conversion is duly filed with, and accepted by,
the Delaware Secretary of State and the Articles of Conversion are duly filed
with, and accepted by, the North Carolina Secretary of State or at such later
date and time as IMS Health and the Converting Corporation shall agree in
writing and shall specify in the Certificate of Conversion and the Articles
of Conversion (the time the Conversion becomes effective being the "
_Conversion Effective Time_ ").

4.  _Effect of the Conversion_. The Conversion shall have the effects set
forth in this Plan of Conversion, the Merger Agreement and in the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and NCBCA. Pursuant to Section 265(f) of the DGCL, upon
the Conversion Effective Time the Converted Corporation shall for all
purposes of the laws of the State of Delaware be deemed to be the same entity
as the Converting Corporation.

 

5\. _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Conversion Effective Time, by virtue
of the Conversion and without any action on the part of the Converting
Corporation, Converted Corporation, the holders of any shares of capital stock
of the Converting Corporation or any other person, each share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Converting Corporation ("
_Converting Corporation Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Conversion Effective Time, shall thereupon be converted into and
become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Converted Corporation (" _Converted
Corporation Common Stock_ "). As of the Conversion Effective Time, all such
shares of Converting Corporation Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall
thereafter only represent shares of Converted Corporation Common Stock.

6\. _Charter; Bylaws_.

(a) At the Conversion Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the
Converted Entity shall be as set forth on  _Annex I_ attached hereto and
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Converted Entity until
thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and as provided by applicable
Law.

 

(b) At the Conversion Effective Time, the bylaws of the Converted Entity shall
be as set forth on _Annex II_ attached hereto and shall be the bylaws of the
Converted Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms, the
certificate of incorporation of the Converted Entity and as provided by
applicable Law.

 

7\. _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers of the Converting
Entity immediately prior to the Conversion Effective Time shall be the
directors and officers of the Converted Entity until their successors shall
have been duly elected and qualified.

8\. _Equity Compensation Plans_. All equity compensation plans of the
Converting Entity and all outstanding equity-based awards issued thereunder
(including those equity-based awards assumed by the Converting Entity pursuant
to Section 2.2 of the Merger Agreement) shall be assumed by the Converted
Entity and to the extent that any such plan or award provides for the issuance
of Converting Corporation Common Stock, at the Conversion Effective Time, such
plan or award shall be deemed to provide for the issuance of Converted
Corporation Common Stock.

 



3 9\. _Stock Certificates_. From and after the Conversion Effective Time, all of
the outstanding certificates that prior to that time represented shares of
the Converting Corporation Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes to
evidence ownership of and to represent shares of Converted Corporation Common
Stock. The registered owner on the books and records of the Converted
Corporation or its transfer agent of any such outstanding stock certificate
shall, until such certificate shall have been surrendered for transfer or
conversion or otherwise accounted for to the Converted Corporation or its
transfer agent, have and be entitled to exercise any voting and other rights
with respect to and to receive any dividend and other distributions upon the
shares of the Converted Corporation evidenced by such outstanding certificate
as provided above.

10\. _Governing Law_. This Plan of Conversion shall be governed and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and, so far as
applicable, the conversion provisions of the NCBCA.

11\. _Abandonment_. At any time before the Conversion Effective Time, this
Plan of Conversion may be terminated and the Conversion may be abandoned for
any reason whatsoever by the Board of Directors of the Converting Entity (with
the prior written consent of IMS Health), notwithstanding the approval of
this Plan of Conversion by the stockholders of the Converting Entity.

12\. _Amendment_. The Board of Directors of the Converting Entity (with the
prior written consent of IMS Health) may amend this Plan of Conversion at any
time prior to the filing of a Certificate of Conversion with the Delaware
Secretary of State or the Articles of Conversion with the North Carolina
Secretary of State.

13\. _Tax Treatment_. The parties intend for (i) the Conversion to be treated
as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code, and (ii) this
Plan of Conversion to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION



 



Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Corporation_ "),
hereby certifies that this Certificate of Incorporation has been duly adopted
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), and that: 

1\. The name of the corporation is "Quintiles IMS Holdings, Inc." (hereinafter
referred to as the " _Corporation_ ").

2\. The street address and county of the registered office of the Corporation
in the State of Delaware is 1209 Orange Street, in the City of Wilmington,
County of New Castle, 19801, and the name of its registered agent at such
address is The Corporation Trust Company.

 

3\. The purpose for which the Corporation is organized is to engage in any
lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ").

4\. Capitalization.

 

A. Authorized Shares. The Corporation shall have authority to issue four
hundred and one million (401,000,000) shares, consisting of (a) four hundred
million (400,000,000) shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "
_Common Stock_ "); and (b) one million (1,000,000) shares of Preferred
Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Preferred Stock_ ").

B. Common Stock. All shares of Common Stock will be identical in all respects
and will entitle the holders thereof to the same preferences, limitations and
relative rights.

 

1\. _Voting Rights_. On all matters to be voted on by the Corporations
stockholders, each holder of record of shares of Common Stock will be
entitled to one vote per share so held.

2\. _Dividends_. When and as dividends are declared or paid on shares of
Common Stock, whether in cash, property or securities of the Corporation, each
holder of record of shares of Common Stock will be entitled to a ratable
portion of such dividend, based upon the number of shares of Common
Stock then held of record by each such holder.

3\. _Liquidation_. The holders of the Common Stock will be entitled to
share ratably, on the basis of the number of shares of Common Stock then held
by each such holder, in all distributions to the holders of the Common Stock
in any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. C. Preferred Stock. The Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time
in one or more series, the shares of each such series to have such
designations, preferences, relative rights and powers, including voting powers
(or qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof) as are stated in the
resolution or resolutions providing for the issuance of such series adopted
by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Authority is expressly granted
to the Board of Directors, subject to the provisions hereof and to any
limitations provided under the DGCL, to authorize the issuance of one or more
series within the class of Preferred Stock, and with respect to each such
series to determine and fix by resolution or resolutions the designations,
preferences, relative rights and powers, including voting powers, full or
limited, or no voting power, of such shares, or the qualifications,
limitations or restrictions of such shares. This paragraph is intended to
afford to the Board of Directors the maximum authority permitted under the
DGCL.

 

5\. Stockholders of the Corporation may not take any action by written consent
in lieu of a meeting.

 

Subject to the requirements of applicable law, a special meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation may be called at any time (i) by a majority
of the members of the Board of Directors or (ii) by the Chairman of the Board
or Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation. Any special meeting of the
stockholders shall be held on such date, at such time and at such place within
or outside the State of Delaware as the Corporation may designate. Notice of
every special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall state the
purpose or purposes of such meeting. No business may be transacted and no
corporate action may be taken at a special meeting other than business within
the purpose or purposes stated in the notice of the meeting unless all of the
stockholders are present in person or by proxy, in which case any and all
business may be transacted at the meeting even though the meeting is held
without notice.

6\. The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the person in whose name any
shares are registered as the owner thereof for all purposes and shall not be
bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to, or interest in, such
shares on the part of any other person, whether or not the Corporation shall
have notice thereof, except as required by applicable law.

7\. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under
the direction of the Board of Directors. The number of directors which shall
constitute the Board of Directors shall be not less than five (5) nor more
than seventeen (17), and shall be fixed in such a manner as may be prescribed
by the Bylaws. The directors shall be divided into three classes designated
Class I, Class II and Class III with each class consisting, as nearly as
possible, of one-third of the total number of directors constituting the
entire Board of Directors. Class I directors shall initially serve for a term
expiring at the first annual meeting of stockholders following the
effectiveness of this Certificate of Incorporation, Class II directors shall
initially serve for a term expiring at the second annual meeting of
stockholders following the effectiveness of this Certificate of Incorporation
and Class III directors shall initially serve for a term expiring at the third
annual meeting of stockholders following the effectiveness of this Certificate
of Incorporation. At each succeeding annual meeting, successors to the class
of directors whose term expires at that annual

 



2  meeting shall be elected for a term expiring at the third succeeding annual
meeting of stockholders. If the number of directors is changed, any increase
or decrease shall be apportioned among the classes so as to maintain the
number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, and any
additional director of any class appointed or elected to fill a newly created
directorship resulting from an increase in such class shall hold office for a
term that shall coincide with the remaining term of that class, but in no case
shall a decrease in the number of directors remove or shorten the term of any
incumbent director. A director shall hold office until the annual meeting
at which his or her term expires and until his or her successor shall be
elected and qualified, subject, however, to prior death, resignation,
retirement, disqualification or removal from office. The Board of Directors is
authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in office to
their respective initial class.

8\. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by law, the
Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, alter, amend and repeal
the Bylaws of the Corporation. Any amendment, alteration, change, addition or
repeal of the Bylaws of the Corporation by the stockholders of
the Corporation shall require the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding shares of the Corporation,
voting together as a class, entitled to vote on such amendment, alteration,
change, addition or repeal.

9\. Subject to the Bylaws of the Corporation, the stockholders may, at any
meeting the notice of which shall state that it is called for that purpose,
remove, only for cause and with the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding shares of the Corporation,
voting together as a class, any Director, or the entire Board of Directors,
and fill the vacancy or vacancies; in each case provided that whenever any
director shall have been elected by a voting group of stockholders, only the
stockholders from that voting group may participate in the vote to remove him
or her, and such vacancy may be filled only by the holders of shares of that
voting group. Subject to the Bylaws of the Corporation, vacancies caused by
any such removal and not filled by the stockholders at the meeting at which
such removal shall have been made, or any vacancy caused by the death or
resignation of any director or for any other reason, and any newly created
directorship resulting from any increase in the authorized number of
Directors, may be filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
directors then in office, although less than a quorum. Any director so elected
to fill any such vacancy or newly created directorship shall hold office until
the next election of the class for which such director has been chosen
and until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her
earlier resignation or removal.

Subject to the Bylaws of the Corporation, when one or more directors shall
resign effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office,
including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or
vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or
resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold
office as herein provided in connection with the filling of other vacancies.

 

10\. Limitation of Director Liability; Indemnification

 

(A) Limitation of Director Liability. To the fullest extent that the DGCL or
any other law of the State of Delaware (as they exist on the date hereof or
as they may hereafter be amended) permits the limitation or elimination of the
liability of directors, no director of the

 



3  Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director. No amendment to,
or modification or repeal of, this Article 10 shall adversely affect any
right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing hereunder with
respect to any state of facts existing or act or omission occurring, or any
cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this Article 10, would accrue or
arise, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal. If the DGCL is amended
after the Effective Time to authorize corporate action further eliminating or
limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director
of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent
permitted by the DGCL, as so amended.

(B) Indemnification. 

1\. _Nature of Indemnity_. The Corporation shall indemnify any person (an "
_Indemnitee_ ") who at any time serves or has served as a director or officer
of the Corporation, or at the request of the Corporation is or was serving as
a director, officer, partner, member, trustee, employee or agent of any other
foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise, or as a
trustee or administrator under any employee benefit plan of the Corporation or
any wholly owned subsidiary thereof (any such entity, an " _Other Entity_ "),
to the fullest extent from time to time permitted by law in the event he or
she is or is threatened to be involved as a party, witness or otherwise in any
threatened, pending or completed action, demand, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative, investigative or other and
whether formal or informal, including but not limited to any investigation,
inquiry, hearing or alternative dispute resolution process, whether or
not brought by or on behalf of the Corporation, by reason of the fact that he
or she is or was acting in such capacity; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Corporation shall not indemnify any such Indemnitee against liability or
expenses such person may incur on account of his or her activities which
were, at the time taken, known or believed by him or her to be clearly in
conflict with the best interests of the Corporation. The rights of those
receiving indemnification hereunder shall, to the fullest extent from time to
time permitted by law, cover (1) reasonable expenses, including without
limitation all reasonable attorneys fees actually incurred by him or her in
connection with any such action, suit or proceeding; (2) all payments made by
him or her in satisfaction of any judgment, money decree, fine (including an
excise tax assessed with respect to an employee benefit plan), penalty, or
settlement for which he or she may have become liable in such action, suit or
proceeding; and (3) all reasonable expenses incurred in enforcing the
indemnification rights provided herein. The rights granted herein shall not be
limited by the provisions contained in Section 145 of the DGCL.

 

2\. _Determination That Indemnification Is Proper_. The Board of Directors
shall take all such action as may be necessary and appropriate to authorize
the Corporation to pay the indemnification required by Article 10(B)(1),
including without limitation making a determination that indemnification is
permissible in the circumstances and a good faith evaluation of the manner in
which the claimant for indemnity acted and of the reasonable amount of
indemnity due him or her. The Board of Directors may appoint a committee or
special counsel to make such determination and evaluation. The Board of
Directors may give notice to, and obtain approval by, the stockholders of the
Corporation for any decision to indemnify.

 



4 3\. _Advance Payment of Expenses_. Expenses incurred by a director or
an officer in connection with an action, suit or proceeding referred to in
Article 10(B)(1) shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay such amount unless it
shall ultimately be determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by
the Corporation pursuant to this Article 10(B); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Corporation shall have no obligation to advance expenses incurred by a
director or officer with respect to any claim initiated by such director or
officer without the prior written consent of or authorization of the Board of
Directors (other than a claim brought by a director or officer to enforce his
or her or rights under this Article 10). Such expenses incurred by other
employees and agents may be so paid upon such terms and conditions, if any, as
the Board of Directors deems appropriate. The Board of Directors may
authorize the Corporations legal counsel to represent such director, officer,
employee or agent in any action, suit or proceeding, whether or not the
Corporation is a party to such action, suit or proceeding.

 

4\. _No Duplication of Payments_. The Corporation shall not be liable under
this Article 10(B) to make any payment in connection with any claim made
against any Indemnitee to the extent such person has otherwise received
payment (under any insurance policy, bylaw or otherwise) of the amounts
otherwise payable as indemnity hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Corporation agrees that, as between the Corporation, on the one hand, and any
Sponsor Stockholder with whom a director is or was affiliated and any insurer
providing insurance coverage to such Sponsor Stockholder, on the other hand,
the Corporation (1) is the indemnitor of first resort under this Article 10
(i.e., its obligations under this Article 10 are primary and any
indemnification or advancement obligations of any Sponsor Stockholder with
whom a director is or was affiliated and the obligations of any insurer of
such Sponsor Stockholder to provide insurance coverage with respect to the
same obligations are secondary), (2) shall be required to advance the full
amount of expenses incurred by the director and shall be liable for the full
amount of indemnification obligations as required by the terms of this
Certificate of Incorporation and any other agreements the Corporation may have
with the director, without regard to any rights the director may have against
such Sponsor Stockholder, and (c) unconditionally and irrevocably waives,
relinquishes, releases such Sponsor Stockholder from and agrees not to
exercise any rights that it may have with respect to any and all claims
for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof. For purposes of this Article 10, " _Sponsor Stockholder_ " means any
current or former stockholder that is or was party to the Stockholders
Agreement (as defined below), any Affiliate (as defined in the Stockholders
Agreement) of such stockholder (other than the Corporation and its
subsidiaries), and/or any other investment entity or related management
company that is advised by the same investment adviser as any of the
foregoing entities or by an Affiliate (as defined in the Stockholders
Agreement) of such investment adviser.

 



5 5\. _Subrogation_. Subject to the limitations set forth in Article
10(B)(4), in the event of payment of indemnification to an Indemnitee, the
Corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to any right of
recovery such person may have and such person, as a condition of receiving
indemnification from the Corporation, shall execute all documents and do all
things that the Corporation may deem necessary or desirable to perfect such
right of recovery, including the execution of such documents necessary to
enable the Corporation effectively to enforce any such recovery.

(C) Insurance. The Corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, trustee,
employee, member or agent of the Corporation, or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, trustee, employee, member or agent of
an Other Entity, against any liability asserted against the person and
incurred by the person in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her
status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power or the
obligation to indemnify such person against such liability under
the provisions of this Article 10 or the DGCL.

(D) Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any Indemnitee by this
Article 10 are not exclusive of other rights arising under any bylaw,
agreement, vote of directors or stockholders or otherwise, and shall continue
as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent,
and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs and legal representatives of such
Indemnitee. The Corporation may enter into an agreement with any of its
directors, officers, employees or agents providing for indemnification and
advancement of expenses, including attorneys fees, that may change, enhance,
qualify or limit any right to indemnification or advancement of expenses
created by this Article 10.

(E) Survival; Amendment or Repeal. The foregoing provisions of this Article
10 shall be deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each
Indemnitee at any time while these provisions as well as the relevant
provisions of the DGCL are in effect and any repeal or modification thereof
shall not affect any right or obligation then existing with respect to any
state of facts then or previously existing or any action, suit, or proceeding
previously or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in part upon
any such state of facts. Such a contract right may not be modified
retroactively without the consent of the Indemnitee.

 

(F) Other Indemnification. This Article 10 shall not limit the right of the
Corporation, to the extent and in the manner permitted by law, to indemnify
and to advance expenses to Indemnitees or persons other than Indemnitees when
and as authorized by appropriate corporate action, including without
limitation by separate agreement with the Corporation.

 

11\. Except as set forth herein, the Corporation reserves the right to amend,
alter, change or repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of
Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all
rights conferred on stockholders herein are granted subject to this
reservation.

 

12\. Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of
Delaware, as the Bylaws of the Corporation may provide. The books of the
Corporation may be kept (subject to any provision contained in applicable law)
outside the State of Delaware at such place as may be designated from time to
time by the Board of Directors or in the Bylaws of the Corporation.

 



6 13\. The stockholders of the Corporation shall have no right to cumulate their
votes for the election of directors.

14\. Renouncement of Corporate Opportunity

 

A. Scope. The provisions of this Article 14 are set forth to define, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, the duties of Exempted Persons (as
defined below) to the Corporation and, to the extent applicable, its
stockholders, with respect to certain classes or categories of business
opportunities. " _Exempted Person_ " means each of the Bain Shareholders, the
TPG Shareholders, the CPP Shareholder and the LG Shareholders (each as defined
in the Shareholders Agreement, dated as of May 3, 2016, by and among the
Corporation and certain of its stockholders named therein, as such agreement
existed as of May 3, 2016 (the " _Stockholders Agreement_ ")), their
respective Affiliates (other than the Corporation and its subsidiaries), TPG
Global, LLC and Bain Capital, LLC and their Affiliates and all of
their respective partners, principals, directors, officers, members,
managers, managing directors and/or employees, including any of the foregoing
who serve as officers or directors of the Corporation. Solely for purposes of
this Article 14, references to " _Affiliate_ ", " _Nominee_ ", and "
_Stockholder Group_ " have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the
Stockholders Agreement.

 

B. Competition and Allocation of Corporate Opportunities. The Exempted Persons
shall not have any fiduciary or other duty to refrain from engaging directly
or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business
as the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries. To the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law, the Corporation, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries,
renounces any interest or expectancy of the Corporation and its subsidiaries
in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, business
opportunities that are from time to time presented to the Exempted
Persons, even if the opportunity is one that the Corporation or its
subsidiaries might reasonably be deemed to have pursued or had the ability or
desire to pursue if granted the opportunity to do so, and each such Exempted
Person shall have no duty to communicate or offer such business opportunity
to the Corporation and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
shall not be liable to the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or, to the
extent applicable, any of its or their stockholders, for breach of any
fiduciary or other duty, as a director or officer or otherwise, by reason of
the fact that such Exempted Person pursues or acquires such business
opportunity, directs such business opportunity to another person or fails to
present such business opportunity, or information regarding such business
opportunity, to the Corporation or its subsidiaries.

 

C. Certain Matters Deemed Not Corporate Opportunities. In addition to and
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 14, a corporate
opportunity shall not be deemed to belong to the Corporation if it is a
business opportunity that the Corporation is not financially able or
contractually permitted or legally able to undertake, or that is, from
its nature, not in the line of the Corporations business or is of no
practical advantage to it or that is one in which the Corporation has no
interest or reasonable expectancy.

 



7 D. Effect of Stockholders Agreement. The provisions of Sections B and C
of this Article 14 (i) shall be subject to compliance with any procedures
regarding corporate opportunities specified in the Stockholders Agreement and
(ii) shall continue with respect to an Exempted Person until the first date
that both of the following conditions are true (a) such Exempted Persons
applicable Stockholder Group is not entitled to designate at least one (1)
Nominee to the Board of Directors of the Corporation pursuant to the
Stockholders Agreement, and (b) no individual is serving on the Board who has
at any time been designated as a Nominee by such Exempted Persons applicable
Stockholder Group.

 

E. Amendment of this Article 14. No amendment or repeal of this Article 14 in
accordance with the provisions of Article 11 shall apply to or have any
effect on the liability or alleged liability of any Exempted Person for or
with respect to any activities or opportunities of which such Exempted Person
becomes aware prior to such amendment or repeal. This Article 14 shall not
limit any protections or defenses available to, or indemnification or
advancement rights of, any director or officer of the Corporation under this
Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, the Corporations bylaws or
applicable law.

of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual or special meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation to present a nomination or proposed business
or does not provide the information required by _Section 1.2 (c)_, including
any required supplement thereto, such nomination shall be disregarded and such
proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in
respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For purposes
of this _Section 1.2_, to be considered a qualified representative of the
stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or partner of
such stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by such
stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder to act
for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such person
must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable
reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of
stockholders.

(h) Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of
stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the
Corporations notice of meeting. Nominations of persons for election to the
Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which
directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting

a stockholder of record at the time the notice provided for in this _Section
1.2_ is delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, who is entitled to
vote at the meeting upon such election and who complies with the notice

more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder entitled to
vote in such election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the
case may be) for election to such position(s) as specified in the
Corporations notice of meeting, if the stockholders notice required by
paragraph (b) of this _Section 1.2_ shall be delivered to the Secretary of
the Corporation at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not
earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such special
meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of (x) the 90th
day prior to such special meeting or (y) the 10th day following the day on
which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting
and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such
meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or
postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period (or extend any
time period) for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above.

(i) All provisions of this _Section 1.2_ are subject to, and nothing in this
_Section 1.2_ shall in any way limit the exercise, or the method or timing of
the exercise of, the rights of any person granted by the Corporation to
nominate directors, including without limitation, such rights contained in
the Stockholders Agreement, which rights may be exercised without compliance
with the provisions of this _Section 1.2_. For purposes of these bylaws, "
