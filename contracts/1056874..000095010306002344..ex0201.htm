 ARTICLE 2 
 THE MERGER

 

  Section 2.01 _. The Merger._ (a) At the Effective Time, Merger
Subsidiary shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in
accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger
Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation").

 

  (b) As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger, the Company and
Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate of merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State and make all other filings or recordings required by
Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective
at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate of merger is duly filed
with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be
specified in the certificate of merger).

 

  (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

 

  Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any further action on the part of any party:

 

  (a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.04, each share of Company
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into the right to receive $12.50 in cash, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"). All such shares of Company Stock, when so converted, shall
cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to
exist;

 

  (b) each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock
or owned by any Subsidiary of the Company or by Parent immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto; and

 

 -8-    
  
 

  (c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights,
powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

  Section 2.03 _. Surrender and Payment._ (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange Agent") reasonably
acceptable to the Company for the purpose of exchanging the (i) certificates
representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") or (ii)
uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares") in each
case for the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to each holder of shares
of Company Stock. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to
the Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares; _provided, however_ , that the
portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration allocable to the dissenting
shares shall not be required to be deposited with the Exchange Agent. The
Exchange Agent shall invest the funds provided by Parent in the manner
specified by Parent, and interest payable thereon shall be solely for the
account of Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Not later than two Business
Days after the date of consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Closing;" such date, the "Closing Date"), Parent
shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of
shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time (other than treasury shares or
shares held by any Subsidiary of the Company or by Parent), a letter of
transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange
Agent) for use in such exchange. All documents to be sent to the holders of
Company Stock by the Exchange Agent shall be in a form reasonably agreed to
by Parent and the Company.

 

  (b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an
"agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect
of the Company Stock represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Share.
Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

 

  (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and 

 

 -9-    
  
 

 (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any
transfer or other taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 

  (d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article
2.

 

  (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration (including any interest
thereon) made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that
remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Stock six months after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent by the Exchange Agent, and any
such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock
for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of shares of Company Stock two years after the Effective Time (or such earlier
date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

  Section 2.04 _. Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding Section 2.02,
shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in
accordance with Delaware Law shall not be converted into a right to receive
the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the right to appraisal, such
shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give
Merger Subsidiary prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Company Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the Delaware Law that are
received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Stock, and
Merger Subsidiary shall have the right to participate in and control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Merger Subsidiary, the Company shall not make any
payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

 

 -10-    
  
 

  Section 2.05 _. Stock Options; Restricted Stock Awards._ (a) At or
immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of
Company Stock granted under any employee stock option or compensation plan or
arrangement of the Company (a "Company Stock Option") outstanding at the
Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be canceled,
and Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to each
holder of any Company Stock Option at or promptly after the Effective Time for
each Company Stock Option an amount in cash (without interest) determined by
multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration per share of
Company Stock over the applicable exercise price of such Company Stock Option
by (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock such holder could have
purchased (assuming full vesting of such option) had such holder exercised
such Company Stock Option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"Option Consideration").

 

  (b) Effective as of the Effective Time, each Restricted Stock Award
with respect to which shares of Company Stock remain unvested or awarded but
unissued as of the Effective Time shall be canceled, and Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to each holder of any Restricted
Stock Award at or promptly after the Effective Time for each share of Company
Stock subject to such award, an amount equal to the Merger Consideration;
_provided_ , that no such payment shall be made as to any outstanding share
of Company Stock for which payment is to be made pursuant to Section 2.02.

 

  (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents from holders of Company Stock
Options and (ii) make any amendments to the terms of any stock option or
compensation plan or arrangement that, in the case of either clauses (i) or
(ii), are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by Section
2.05(a).

 

  Section 2.06 _. Adjustments._ If, during the period between the date
hereof and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of Company
Stock shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period,
but excluding any change that results from any exercise of Company Stock
Options, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.

 

  Section 2.07 _. Withholding Rights._ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of Company Stock, Company Stock Options or
Restricted Stock Awards, as the case may be, in

 

 -11-    
  
 

 respect of which the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be,
made such deduction and withholding.

 

  Section 2.08 _. Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated
by this Article 2.

 

 ARTICLE 3 
 THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

 

  Section 3.01 _. Certificate of Incorporation._ At the Effective Time,
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended
to read in its entirety in the form of Exhibit A hereto, and, as so amended,
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
amended in accordance with Applicable Law.

 

  Section 3.02 _. Bylaws._ The bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in effect at
the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
amended in accordance with Applicable Law.

 

  Section 3.03 _. Directors and Officers._ From and after the Effective
Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in
accordance with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii)
the officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall cause
all directors of the Company to resign at or immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 

 ARTICLE 4 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

  Except as set forth in the applicable section (or in any additional
section where the applicability of such disclosure to such additional section
is reasonably apparent on its face) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Subsidiary that:

 

  Section 4.01 _. Corporate Existence and Power._ The Company is a

 -12-    
  
 

 licenses, authorizations, permits, consents, variances, exemptions, orders,
franchises and approvals (collectively, the "Permits") required to carry on
its business as now conducted, except for those Permits the absence of which
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure
to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made
available or delivered to Parent true and complete copies of the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as currently in
effect.

 

  Section 4.02. _Corporate Authorization._ (a) The execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Companys
corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the Companys
stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company. The
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Stock (the "Company Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of the
holders of any of the Companys capital stock necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject

has (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Companys stockholders
and has declared this Agreement advisable, (ii) approved and adopted this

Agreement by its stockholders (such recommendation, the "Company Board
Recommendation").

respect of, or filing with, or other approval from, any Governmental
Authority other than (i) the filing of a certificate of merger with respect to
the Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and appropriate documents with
the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company is qualified to
do business, (ii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act
and of applicable laws, rules and regulations in foreign jurisdictions
governing antitrust or merger control matters, (iii) compliance with any
applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and any other applicable
U.S. state or federal securities laws,

 

-13-

delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) conflict with

or both) under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration
or other change of any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision
of any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit, certificate, approval
or other similar authorization affecting the assets or business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of
any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with only
such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii) through (iv), as would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

  (b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default or
violation (and no event has occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default or violation) of any term, condition or
provision of (i) the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (ii)
the comparable charter or organizational documents of any of the Companys
material Subsidiaries or (iii) the comparable charter or organizational
documents of any of the Companys other Subsidiaries except, in the case of
clause (iii), for defaults or violations which would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

 

  Section 4.05 _. Capitalization._ (a) The authorized capital stock of
the Company consists of: (i) 300,000,000 shares of Company Stock, of which
77,628,042 shares were issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2006,
including 862,556 shares of restricted Company Stock issued pursuant to the
Companys equity incentive plans; and (ii) 50,000,000 shares of preferred

nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights. No Subsidiary of the
Company owns any shares of capital stock of the Company. As of September 30,
2006, (1) 2,018,112 shares of Company Stock were reserved for issuance
pursuant to the Companys equity

 

-14-    
  
 

 incentive plans, of which 930,632 shares of Company Stock were subject to

Company Stock Option and restricted stock units outstanding as of the date
hereof, including the holder and, to the extent applicable, the exercise
price, vesting schedule and number of shares of Company Stock subject thereto.

 

  (b) Except as set forth in this Section 4.05 and for changes since
September 30, 2006 resulting from the exercise of Company Stock Options
outstanding on such date, there are no outstanding (i) shares of capital
stock or voting securities (including voting debt securities) of the Company,
(ii) securities of the Company convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
capital stock or voting securities of the Company or (iii) options or other
rights to acquire from the Company, or other obligation of the Company to
issue, any capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for capital stock or voting securities of the Company (the items
in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) being referred to collectively as the "Company
Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company
Securities. There are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or
other agreements or understandings to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which any of them are bound, relating to the
voting of any shares of Company Securities.

 

  Section 4.06 _. Subsidiaries._ (a) Each Subsidiary of the Company is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization and has all corporate, partnership or similar
powers and all Permits required to carry on its business as now conducted,
except for those Permits the absence of which would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Each
such Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is
necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 4.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
lists each Subsidiary of the Company. The Company has heretofore made
available or delivered to Parent true and complete copies of
the organizational documents of each of its material Subsidiaries as
currently in effect.

 

  (b) All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other voting securities
(including voting debt securities) or ownership interests in, each Subsidiary
of the Company, is owned by the Company, directly or indirectly, free and
clear of any Lien. There are no outstanding (i) securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital
stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in any Subsidiary of
the Company or (ii) options or other rights to acquire from the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, or

 

-15-    
  
 

 other obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any
capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in, or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable for any capital stock or other
voting securities or ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company

"Company Subsidiary Securities"). There are no outstanding obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any of the Company Subsidiary Securities. Except for the ownership of the
Subsidiaries of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, owns, or has agreed to purchase or otherwise acquire,
the capital stock or other equity or voting interests of, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable for such capital stock or such equity or
voting interests of, any Person.

 

  Section 4.07 _. SEC Filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act._ (a) The
Company has heretofore made available or delivered to Parent a true and
complete copy (including any amendments thereto) of (i) the Companys annual
reports on Form 10-K for its fiscal years ended September 30, 2003, 2004 and
2005, (ii) its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for its fiscal quarters ending
December 31, 2005, March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006, (iii) its proxy or

meeting by, the stockholders of the Company held since December 31, 2004 and
(iv) all of its other reports, statements, schedules and registration
statements filed with the SEC since September 30, 2005 (the documents
referred to in this Section 4.07(a), collectively, the "Company SEC
Documents"). The Company SEC Documents comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, 1934 Act and
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, in each case, the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and did not, at the time they were filed, or, if amended, as of
the date of such amendment, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (including any
financial statements or other documentation incorporated by
reference therein). None of the Companys Subsidiaries is, or at any time
since September 30, 2003 has been, subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) and 15(d) of the 1934 Act.

 

  (b) The Company and each of its officers are in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
The management of the Company has, in material compliance with Rule 13a-15
under the 1934 Act, (i) designed disclosure controls and procedures to ensure
that material information relating to the Company, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is promptly made known to the management of the Company by
others within those entities, and (ii) disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and the audit
committee of the Companys Board of Directors (A) any significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting ("Internal Controls") which

 

 -16-    
  
 

 would adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize
and report financial data and have identified for the Companys auditors any
material weaknesses in Internal Controls and (B) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys Internal Controls.

 

  Section 4.08 _. Financial Statements._ Except as disclosed in the
Company SEC Documents filed before the date hereof and where the applicability
of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face, the audited
consolidated financial statements (including all notes and schedules thereto)
and the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the Company
included in the Company SEC Documents fairly present, in all material
respects, in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to normal year-
end adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim financial statements).

 

  Section 4.09 _. Proxy Statement._ The proxy statement of the Company to
be filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger (the "Company Proxy
Statement"), any amendments or supplements thereto and any other document
filed or to be filed with the SEC by the Company in connection therewith,
will, when filed, comply in each case as to form in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the 1934 Act _._ At the time the Company
Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto is first mailed to
stockholders of the Company, and at the time such stockholders vote on
adoption of this Agreement, the Company Proxy Statement, as supplemented or
amended, if applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The representations
and warranties contained in this Section 4.09 will not apply to statements or
omissions included in the Company Proxy Statement based upon information
furnished to the Company by Parent or Merger Subsidiary specifically
for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

 

  Section 4.10 _. Absence of Certain Changes._ Except as disclosed in the
Company SEC Documents filed before the date hereof and where the applicability
of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face, since the Company
Balance Sheet Date, the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been
conducted in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and
there has not been:

 

  (a) any event, occurrence, change, effect, development or state of
circumstances or facts that has had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; or

 

 -17-    
  
 

  (b) any action taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from the
Company Balance Sheet Date through the date hereof that, if taken during the
period from the date hereof through the Effective Time, would constitute a

or request has been withdrawn), (C) provide Parent promptly with copies of all
material correspondence between the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
respective directors, employees, agents or representatives and any Third

 -35-    
  
 

 compliance with Section 6.03(a), has made an unsolicited bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead

confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement and (iii) make an Adverse Recommendation Change,
but in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii) only

majority vote, after considering advice from outside legal counsel to
the Company, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under Applicable Law. The
Board of Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions referred

taking such action the Company shall have delivered to Parent written notice

Company shall be permitted to take any action necessary to comply with Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal and to make any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in
the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, after
considering advice from outside legal counsel to the Company, failure so to
disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under Applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the fact that a disclosure or other action may
be deemed permissible by virtue of this sentence does not in and of itself
mean that any such disclosure or other action constitutes an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 

  Section 6.04 _. Access to Information._ From the date hereof until the
Effective Time, and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality
Agreement dated as of July 20, 2006, between the Company and Parent (the

Subsidiaries and its and their officers, employees and other representatives
to, provide Parent with all cooperation reasonably requested in connection

intangible), personnel and liabilities comprising each of the bath products
division and the plumbing products division of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

 

  Section 6.05. _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company or its directors relating to the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that no such settlement
shall be agreed to without Parents consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 

  Section 6.06 _. Tax Matters._ The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts (a) to obtain all applicable regulatory approvals and
clearances that are necessary to permit the purchase by the Company of the
stock of USI American Holdings, Inc. from JBI Holdings, Ltd. (the "USIAH

 ARTICLE 7 
 COVENANTS OF PARENT AND MERGER SUBSIDIARY

  Section 7.01. _Director and Officer Liability_. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

 

  (a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers and
directors of the Company (each an "Indemnified Person") in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions

 

 -37-    
  
 

 contemplated hereby) to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any
other Applicable Law or provided under the Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof.

 

  (b) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall provide officers and directors liability insurance in respect of acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such
Indemnified Person currently covered by the Companys officers and directors
liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no
less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof,
_provided_ that if such a policy cannot reasonably be procured for an annual
premium of 300% of the premium paid by the Company in respect of the current
year as of the date hereof, then the Surviving Corporation shall provide
insurance with the greatest coverage and amount reasonably procurable for
such a premium. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing (and
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement), prior to the Effective
Time and without the consent of any other Person, the Company shall be
entitled to obtain prepaid insurance policies providing for the coverage
contemplated by this Section. If such prepaid policies have been obtained
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall not cancel such policies or permit
such policies to be canceled.

 

  (c) If Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made prior
to such transaction so that the successors and assigns of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.01.

 

  (d) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall include provisions for exculpation of director and officer
liability and indemnification on the same basis as set forth in the Companys
certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof. For six
years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in
effect the provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws
providing for indemnification of Indemnified Persons with respect to the facts
or circumstances occurring at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest
extent permitted from time to time under Delaware Law, which provisions shall
not be amended except as required by changes in Applicable Law or except to
make changes permitted by applicable law that would enlarge the scope of the
Indemnified Persons indemnification rights thereunder.

 

  (e) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable and documented
expenses, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel, that an
Indemnified Person may incur in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations
provided for in this Section 7.01. The Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
control the defense

 

 -38-    
  
 

 of any Proceeding with counsel of its own choosing reasonably acceptable to
the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the
defense thereof; _provided_ that, for each separate Proceeding, the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for the fees of more than one counsel for all
Indemnified Persons, other than local counsel, unless a conflict of interest
shall be caused thereby; and _provided further_ that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

 

  (f) The Surviving Corporation shall pay on an as-incurred basis the
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of such Indemnified Person
(including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in advance of the
final disposition of any Proceeding that is the subject of the right to
indemnification; _provided_ that such Person shall undertake to reimburse the
Surviving Corporation for all amounts so advanced if a court of competent
jurisdiction determines, by a final, nonappealable order, that such Person is
not entitled to indemnification.

 

  (g) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.01 shall
be in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All such
rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person against the Surviving
Corporation.

 

  Section 7.02 _. Employee Benefits._ (a) For 12 months following the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) to, provide each employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (a "Company Employee") with compensation and benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits
provided to such employee immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
, that in determining such compensation and benefits provided to such
employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, the following types of
compensation and benefits shall be excluded: (i) pension benefits provided
under any defined benefit and similar plans; (ii) equity-based and other
long-term incentive plans and awards (other than the Companys annual
incentive plan which shall be included); and (iii) retiree welfare benefits.

 

  (b) For 12 months following the Effective Time, Parent shall continue,
without any change adverse to the Company Employees, each severance plan,
program or agreement identified on Schedule 7.02(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

 

  (c) Parent agrees to honor, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to honor, the obligations of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries under the provisions of each Employee Plan, including
all change in control plans and agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
subject to

 

 -39-    
  
 

 Applicable Law and except as explicitly provided for herein, nothing is
intended to prevent Parent from amending or terminating any such Employee Plan
in accordance with its terms.

 

  (d) Each Company Employee will receive service credit for all periods
of employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor
thereof prior to the Effective Time for purposes of vesting, eligibility and
benefit levels under any employee benefit plan in which such employee
participates after the Effective Time, to the extent that such service was
recognized under any analogous plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that no such
service credit shall be given for purposes of benefit accruals under any
defined benefit pension plan.

 

  (e) If on or after the Effective Time any Company Employee becomes
covered under any benefit plan providing medical, dental, health,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits (a "Successor Plan"), other than the plan
in which he or she participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (a
"Prior Plan"), any such Successor Plan shall not include any restrictions or
limitations with respect to any pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements (except to the extent such exclusions or
requirements were applicable under the corresponding Prior Plan), and any
eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the calendar year in which the Company Employee becomes
covered under any Successor Plan shall be taken into account under any such
Successor Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and/or his or
her covered dependents for that year, to the extent that such expenses were
incurred during a period in which the Company Employee or covered dependent
was covered under a corresponding Prior Plan.

 

  (f) No Company Employee shall have any third party beneficiary rights
or rights to any specific levels of compensation or benefits as a result of
the application of this Section 7.02 and nothing contained in this Section
7.02 shall be treated as an amendment to any Employee Plan.

 

  (g) Prior to the first to occur of the Effective Time or the occurrence
of a "Change in Control" (as such term is defined in the Company Group
Welfare and Flexible Benefits Plan), the Company shall amend the Company Group
Welfare and Flexible Benefits Plan to delete Article IV thereof in its entirety
so that the Company will have no obligation under such Article IV (and the
Companys rights with respect to such plan shall otherwise not be limited by
the provisions of such Article IV that would otherwise take effect upon the
occurrence of such a "Change in Control"), and no participant in such plan
shall have any right under such Article IV, from and after the Effective
Time.

 

  (h) If and to the extent that under Part III of the Pensions Act 2004
the Company has the power to do so, the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain an agreement with any applicable plan trustees as to any
updated

 

 -40-    
  
 

 contribution schedules required under Part III of the Pensions Act 2004 or
under the applicable plan rules for any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan maintained,
contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
provides benefits to employees in the United Kingdom and, if requested by
Parent, shall collaborate with Parent in connection with such efforts, such
collaboration to include (i) providing the Parent with access (subject only
to the trustees consent) to all meetings of or with the trustees and (ii) if
Parent so elects and the Company agrees (such agreement not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) permitting Parent (and such of its Affiliates and such
of its or their officers, directors and employees as Parent may elect) be a

basis and upon reasonable advance notice, to meet with prospective lenders and

documents and certificates referenced in the immediately preceding clause (vi)
shall be executed and delivered except in connection with the Closing (and
the effectiveness thereof shall be conditioned upon, or become operative
after, the occurrence of the Closing) and shall impose no personal liability
on the officers or

 

 -43-    
  
 

 employees involved. Parent and Merger Subsidiary recognize and agree that
the Company cannot "require" its accountants, attorneys or officers to provide
or execute any documents and any failure by such accountants, attorneys or
officers to provide such consents or opinions does not affect the obligations
of Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereunder.

 

  (b) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to make available to
Parent and Merger Subsidiary or their representatives, at Parents expense,
as promptly as reasonably practicable: (i) the audited combined balance sheet
of the plumbing products division of the Company as of September 30, 2006,
2005 and 2004, and the audited combined statements of income, cash flows and
shareholders equity of such division for each of the fiscal years ended
September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, together with the related notes thereto,
accompanied by the reports thereon of the Companys accountants, (ii) the
audited combined balance sheet of the bath products division of the Company
as of September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, and the audited combined statements
of income, cash flows and shareholders equity of such division for each of
the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006, 2005 and 2004, together with the
related notes thereto, accompanied by the reports thereon of the Companys
accountants, (iii) following the end of each fiscal month ending on or after
September 30, 2006, the unaudited consolidating balance sheet of the Company
reflecting the plumbing products division and the bath products division of
the Company as of the last day of such fiscal month, and the consolidating
statements of income of each such division for such fiscal month and (iv)
the unaudited combined income statement of the plumbing products division of
the Company for (A) the twelve months ended March 31, 2006 and (B) the six
months ended September 30, 2006 and September 30, 2005. Parent understands and
agrees that in the event of any conflict (including with respect to
allocation of management time or other resources) between the preparation of
the financial statements required to be prepared pursuant to this Section
8.07(b) and the preparation of the Companys annual report on Form 10-K for
its fiscal year ended September 30, 2006, the preparation of such Form 10-K
shall take precedent.

 

  (c) Parent shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all
of its covenants, agreements, representations and warranties contained in any
of the Debt Commitment Letters, (ii) not take any action specifically
prohibited pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters or agree to
amend the Debt Commitment Letters in a manner adverse to the Company and (iii)
if any of the Debt Commitment Letters expire or are terminated prior to the
Closing, use its reasonable best efforts to promptly arrange for alternative
debt financing (upon terms and subject to conditions no less favorable to the
Company in any material respect than those contained in the Debt Commitment
Letters).

 

  Section 8.08. _Debt Tender_. (a) On such date designated by Parent
(which shall be at least three Business Days after the date on which the
Company received such notice from Parent), the Company shall commence a tender
offer and Consent Solicitation (the "Debt Offer") for all of the outstanding
95/8%

 

-44-    
  
 

 Senior Secured Notes due 2010 of the Company (the "Notes") upon the terms
and conditions set forth in Schedule 8.08 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
and otherwise in compliance with Applicable Law and SEC rules and regulations,
and Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall assist the Company in connection
therewith.

 

  (b) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare all
necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with the Debt Offer,
including the offer to purchase, related letters of transmittal and other
related documents (collectively, the "Offer Documents"). Parent and the
Company shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Offer
Documents. All mailings to the holders of the Notes in connection with the
Debt Offer shall be subject to the prior review and comment by each of the
Company and Parent and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of them. The
Company, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall cooperate in connection with the
Debt Offer in order to cause the consent date under the Consent Solicitation
and initial settlement of the Debt Offer to occur simultaneously with the
Closing. The Company shall, and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to,
waive any of the conditions to the Debt Offer (other than that the conditions
to the consummation of the Merger shall have been satisfied or waived and
that there shall be no order or injunction prohibiting consummation of the
Debt Offer) as may be reasonably requested by Parent and shall not, without
the consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Offer or make any
changes to the terms and conditions of the Debt Offer other than as agreed
between Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding
sentence, the Company need not make any change to the terms and conditions of
the Debt Offer requested by Parent that decreases the price per Note payable
in the Debt Offer or imposes conditions to the Debt Offer in addition to those
set forth in Schedule 8.08 of the Company Disclosure Schedule that
are materially adverse to holders of the Notes, unless such change is
approved by the Company in writing. If, at any time prior to the completion of
the Debt Offer, any information in the Offer Documents should be discovered by
the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be disseminated by the Company to the holders of the Notes.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.08(b), the Company
shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-l under the 1934 Act and any
other Applicable Law to the extent such laws are applicable in connection
with the Debt Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any Applicable Law
conflict with this Section 8.08(b), the Company shall comply with the
Applicable Law and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations
hereunder by such compliance.

 

 -45-    
  
 

  (c) Promptly upon the receipt of the Requested Consents with respect to
the indenture for the Notes, the Company shall enter into a supplemental
indenture reflecting the amendments to such indenture approved by such
Requested Consents and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
indenture trustee to promptly enter into such supplemental indenture;
_provided_ , that the amendments contained in such supplemental indenture
shall become operative upon the acceptance of the Debt Offer. The closing of
the Debt Offer shall be conditioned on the simultaneous occurrence of the
Closing. Simultaneously with the Closing and in accordance with the terms of
the Debt Offer, Parent shall provide to the Company the funds necessary to
consummate the Debt Offer and Consent Solicitation (including the payment of
all applicable premiums, consent fees and all related fees and expenses) and
the Company shall accept for purchase and use such funds to purchase the
Notes tendered in the Debt Offer.

 

  (d) If requested by Parent, the Company shall enter into one or more
dealer manager agreements with such Persons as Parent shall reasonably
request. Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of any dealer
manager, information agent, depositary or other agent retained in connection
with the Debt Offer.

 

  (e) For purposes of this Agreement, "Consent Solicitation" shall mean a
solicitation of the Requested Consents from the holders of the Notes; and
"Requested Consents" shall mean the consents of holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Notes to the amendments to the indenture in respect of
the Notes described in Schedule 8.08 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

  (f) Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company and any dealer-manager
under any dealer-manager agreement for any out-of-pocket costs, fees. and
expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the Debt Offer. Parent
and Merger Subsidiary shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective officers and
directors, any dealer-manager and each Person, if any, who controls the
Company within the meaning of Section 20 of the 1934 Act for and against any
and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the Debt Offer and the Offer Documents; _provided, however_ , that
neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary shall have any obligation to indemnify
and hold harmless any such Person to the extent that any such liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred arises from disclosure provided by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (including disclosures incorporated by reference in
the Offer Documents) that is determined to have contained a material
misstatement or omission.

 

  Section 8.09. _Conveyance Taxes_. The Company and Parent will (a)
cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all Tax Returns,
questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property
transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and
stamp Taxes,

 

 -46-    
  
 

 any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes
which become payable in connection with the Transactions, (b) cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all applications or other documents
regarding any applicable exemptions to any such Tax or fee and (c) each pay
any such Tax or fee which becomes payable by it on or before the due date
therefor.

 

  Section 8.10 _. Certain Agreements._ From the date hereof until the
date on which the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company (i)
upon becoming aware of any actual or threatened breach of any agreement set
forth on Schedule 8.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each, a "Specified
Agreement"), shall promptly notify Parent of such breach and (ii) shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, consent or otherwise agree to or
permit any amendment, waiver, modification or assignment of, any Specified
Agreement.

  (c) The Company shall promptly reimburse Parent for the Parent Expenses

means the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including
the reasonable legal fees and expenses) actually incurred by Parent, Merger

  (d) The Company acknowledges that the fee provided for in this Section
11.04 is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and shall not be asserted by it to be or be construed as a penalty, and that,
without such fee, Parent and Merger Subsidiary would not enter into this
Agreement.

 

  Section 11.05 _. Binding Effect; Third Party Beneficiaries;
Assignment._ (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and,
except as provided in Section 7.01, shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Except as provided in
Section 7.01, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 

  (b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other
party hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign
its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time
in part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time, (ii) any
financing source at any time and (iii) after the Effective Time, to any
Person; _provided_ that no such transfer or assignment shall relieve Parent
or Merger Subsidiary from any of its obligations

 

 -53-    
  
 

 hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party
hereto or due to Parent or Merger Subsidiary.

 

  Section 11.06 _. Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

 

  Section 11.07 _. Jurisdiction._ The parties hereto agree that any
suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on
any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal court
located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and
of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Proceeding and 
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
Proceeding in any such court or that any such Proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such
Proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within
or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the
foregoing, each party agrees that service of process on such party as
provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on
such party.

 

  Section 11.08 _. Counterparts; Effectiveness._ This Agreement may be
signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with
the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto
shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other communication).

 

  Section 11.09 _. Entire Agreement._ This Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Article 4 or any other provision contained in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent understands and agrees that the Company is not
making any representation or warranty with respect to (a) the restructuring
of the bath and plumbing businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be
effected by Parent at or after consummation of the Merger or (b) the
Financing and the transactions contemplated thereby.

 

  Section 11.10 _. Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the

 

 -54-    
  
 

 terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

  Section 11.11. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof in any federal court located in the State of Delaware or any
Delaware state court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

 

  Section 11.12 _. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._ EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year
