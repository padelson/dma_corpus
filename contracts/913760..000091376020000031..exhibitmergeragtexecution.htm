ARTICLE 2 Section 2.01 . The Merger.

(a) At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged (the "Merger") with and
into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation").

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as
possible, but in any event no later than three Business Days after the date
the conditions set forth in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or,
to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have
been satisfied or, to the extent permissible, waived by the party or parties
entitled to the benefit of such conditions, or at such other place, at such
other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree
in writing.

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Sub shall file a certificate of
merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the certificate
of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later
time as may be specified in the certificate of merger).

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Sub, all as provided under Delaware Law.

Section 2.02 . Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of any shares of Company Stock or any shares of capital stock
of Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c) or
Section 2.04, each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $6.00 in cash,
without interest (such per share amount, the "Merger Consideration"). As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest.

(b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned
by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto.

(c) Each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number of
shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage
of the outstanding capital stock in the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned in the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges
as the shares so converted and, except as provided in Section 2.02(c), shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 2.03 . Surrender and Payment.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging
for the Merger Consideration certificates representing shares of Company Stock
(the "Certificates") or uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the
"Uncertificated Shares"). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make
available to the Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect
of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Such funds may be invested
by the Exchange Agent as directed by Parent; provided that (i) no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable
hereunder and following any losses if such funds are inadequate to pay the
amounts to which holders of Company Stock are entitled pursuant to this
Article 2, then Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company in the amount of any
such deficiency and (ii) such investments shall only be in short-term
obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30
days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Standard and Poor's Corporation or
Moody's Investors Service, Inc., respectively. Any interest or income produced
by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
Parent directs. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
(but no later than five Business Days thereafter), Parent shall send, or shall
cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock at
the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, in each case (i) or (ii), the Merger Consideration in
respect of the Company Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated
Share. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this Article 2.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Stock twelve months after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
shares of Company Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) shall not be liable
to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Applicable Laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of
shares of Company Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority
shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

Section 2.04 . Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, shares of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has properly demanded appraisal for such shares in accordance
with Delaware Law ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the
right to appraisal, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted
as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent shall
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except
with the prior written consent of Parent or as required by Applicable Law, the
Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or
settle, any such demands. Section 2.05 . Treatment of Company Equity Awards.

(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of
Company Stock under the Company ICP (a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not
exercisable or vested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any action on behalf of
the holder thereof, become vested as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be canceled and shall entitle the holder of each such Company
Stock Option to receive (without interest) as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time an amount in cash determined by multiplying (i) the
excess, if any, of the per share Merger Consideration over the applicable
exercise price of such Company Stock Option by (ii) the number of shares of
Company Stock such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of all
options) had such holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to
the Effective Time, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect
to such payment. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Stock Option which
has an exercise price per share of Company Stock that is greater than or equal
to the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no
consideration or payment.

(b) At the Effective Time, each (i) restricted stock unit and (ii) restricted
stock award, in each case, with respect to shares of Company Stock granted
under the Company ICP, whether subject to time-based or performance-based
vesting, that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each such restricted stock unit, a "Company Restricted Stock Unit" and each
such restricted stock award, a "Company Restricted Stock Award") shall,
automatically and without any action on the holder thereof, become vested as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall be canceled in exchange
for the right to receive (without interest) a cash payment as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time from Parent to the holder
thereof determined by multiplying (I) the per share Merger Consideration by
(II) the number of shares of Company Stock underlying such Company Restricted
Stock Unit or Company Restricted Stock Award, as applicable, as of the
Effective Time, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment; provided that, with respect to Company Restricted Stock Units or
Company Restricted Stock Awards that constitute nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to
be paid at the Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under
Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall be made at the earliest time
permitted under the Company ICP and award agreement that will not trigger a
Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code. For the purposes of the
preceding sentence, for any outstanding Company Restricted Stock Unit award
subject to performance-based vesting, (A) if the performance period applicable
to such award has concluded, the number of shares of Company Stock underlying
such Company Restricted Stock Unit shall be reasonably determined by the
compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the Company based on
actual performance during the performance period and (B) if the performance
period applicable to such award has not concluded, the number of shares of
Company Stock underlying such Company Restricted Stock Unit shall, pursuant to
the terms of such unit or award, be calculated using the target performance.

(c) The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all actions
reasonably necessary to terminate the Company ESPP and all outstanding rights
thereunder as of immediately prior to and contingent upon the Effective Time; provided that,
from and after the date hereof, the Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to ensure that (i) the existing participants thereunder may not
increase their elections with respect to the current offering period, (ii) no
employee who is not a participant in the Company ESPP as of the end of the
Business Day immediately prior to the date hereof may become a participant in
the Company ESPP, (iii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Stock
purchasable during the current offering period shall not exceed 134,000 shares
of Company Stock and (iv) no offering period shall commence after the current
offering period and before the Effective Time.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt any resolutions and
make any amendments to the terms of any equity compensation plans that are
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section
2.05. All payments under Section 2.05(a), Section 2.05(b) and Section 2.05(c)
shall be made at or as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, pursuant
to the Company's ordinary payroll practices, and shall be subject to any
applicable withholding as provided by Section 2.08. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective Time neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to deliver shares of
Company Stock or other capital stock of the Company to any Person under any
compensation plan of the Company.

Section 2.06 . Convertible Securities. At the Effective Time each of (i) the
Company's 4.125% Convertible Senior Notes maturing on April 1, 2020 (the "2020
Convertible Notes") issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of April 1,
2015, by and between the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee,
(the "2020 Convertible Notes Indenture") and (ii) the Company's 5.00%
Convertible Senior Notes maturing on August 15, 2022 (the "2022 Convertible
Notes", and together with the 2020 Convertible Notes, the "Convertible Notes")
issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of August 22, 2017, by and between
the Company and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee (the "2022 Convertible
Notes Indenture" and, together with the 2020 Convertible Notes Indenture, the
"Convertible Notes Indentures") shall remain outstanding, unchanged by reason
of the Merger except as set forth in, and required by, Section 10.08 of each
Convertible Note; provided that the 2020 Convertible Notes shall no longer be
outstanding following the Company's satisfaction of all obligations due in
respect of such Convertible Notes on or prior to their scheduled maturity date
on April 1, 2020. Parent acknowledges that the occurrence of the Effective
Time shall constitute a Fundamental Change (as such term is defined in the
Convertible Notes Indentures) and a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as such
term is defined in the Convertible Notes Indentures) in respect of any
Convertible Notes outstanding as of such Effective Time.

Section 2.07 . Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, or any stock dividend thereon
with a record date during such period, but excluding any change that results
from any exercise of options outstanding as of the date hereof to purchase
shares of Company Stock granted under the Company's stock option or
compensation plans or arrangements, the Merger Consideration and any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted. Section 2.08 . Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the
Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so
withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Stock,
Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company Restricted
Stock Awards, as applicable, in respect of which the Exchange Agent, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

Section 2.09 . Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated
by this Article 2.

ARTICLE 3 
THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

Section 3.01 . Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time and by
virtue of the Merger, the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be
amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except (a) for Article FIRST, which shall read "The name of the corporation is
GAIN Capital Holdings, Inc." and (b) as otherwise required by Section 7.04(b),
and as so amended shall be the amended and restated certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with Delaware Law. Nothing in this Section 3.01 shall affect in any
way the indemnification obligations provided for in Section 7.04(b).

Section 3.02 . Bylaws. The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with Applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 3.02 shall affect in
any way the indemnification obligations provided for in Section 7.04(b).

Section 3.03 . Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time,
until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance
with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers set
forth on Section 3.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule hereto shall be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation. ARTICLE 4 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Subject to Section 11.05, other than with respect to the representations and
warranties in Section 4.01, Section 4.02, Section 4.04(i), Section 4.05(a),
the first sentence of Section 4.06(b), Section 4.20, Section 4.21, and Section
4.22, except as disclosed in any Company SEC Document filed after January 1,
2017 and before the date of this Agreement, or as set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents and warrants to Parent that:

Section 4.01 . Corporate Existence and Power. The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all governmental Consents
required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those Consents
the absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified or be in good standing would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.02 . Corporate Authorization.

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions are within the
Company's corporate powers and, except for the required approval of the
Company's stockholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger, have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company Stock is the only vote of the holders of any of the
Company's capital stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the
Merger (the "Company Stockholder Approval"). This Agreement constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of the Company.

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Company's Board of Directors has
adopted resolutions (i) determining that this Agreement and the Transactions
are fair to and in the best interests of the Company's stockholders, (ii)
approving, adopting and declaring advisable this Agreement and the
Transactions, (iii) recommending approval and adoption of this Agreement by
its stockholders (such recommendation, the "Company Board Recommendation"),
(iv) directing that the approval and adoption of this Agreement be submitted
to a vote at a meeting of the Company's stockholders, and (v) approving and
adopting an amendment to the Company Rights Agreement to render the Company
Rights inapplicable to the Merger, this Agreement and the Transactions (a copy
of which amendment was provided to Parent by the Company prior to the date of
this Agreement).

Section 4.03 . Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the Transactions require no action by or in respect of, or filing
by the Company with, any Governmental Authority other than (a) the filing of a
certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the Delaware Secretary
of State and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other which the Company is qualified to do business, (b) compliance with any
applicable requirements of the HSR Act and of laws analogous to the HSR Act
existing in foreign jurisdictions, (c) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, any other applicable state or
federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of NYSE, (d) the
Consents listed on Section 4.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (e) any
other actions or filings the absence of which would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.04 . Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions do not
and will not (i) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
Company, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section
4.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any
provision of any Applicable Law, (iii) assuming compliance with the matters
referred to in Section 4.03, require any Consent or other action by any Person
under, constitute a default, or an event that, with or without notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default under, or cause or permit the
termination, cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or
obligation or the loss of any benefit to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is entitled under, any provision of any Material Contract binding
upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
with only such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii) through (iv),
as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.05 . Capitalization.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 120,000,000 shares
of Company Stock and 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.00001 par value
("Preferred Stock"). As of December 31, 2019, there were outstanding (i)
37,484,276 shares of Company Stock, (ii) no shares of Preferred Stock, (iii)
Company Stock Options to purchase an aggregate of 688,805 shares of Company
Stock (of which Company Stock Options to purchase an aggregate of 635,479
shares of Company Stock were exercisable), (iv) Company Restricted Stock Units
underlying an aggregate of 1,915,887 shares of Company Stock and (v) no
Company Restricted Stock Awards. All outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company have been, and all shares that may be issued pursuant to any
compensation plan will be, when issued in accordance with the respective terms
thereof, duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights.

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible
into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters
on which holders of shares of Company Stock may vote, other than the
Convertible Notes.

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 4.05 and for changes since December
31, 2019 resulting from the exercise of Company Stock Options outstanding on
such date, the settlement of Company Restricted Stock Units, the vesting of
Company Restricted Stock Awards or the conversion of Convertible Notes, there
are no issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in
the Company, (ii) securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of or ownership interests in the Company, (iii) warrants, calls,
options or other rights to acquire from the Company, or other obligation of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock, voting
securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or
voting securities of the Company or (iv) restricted shares, stock appreciation
rights, performance units, contingent value rights, "phantom" stock or similar
securities or rights that are derivative of, or provide economic benefits
based, directly or indirectly, on the value or price of, any capital stock or
voting securities of the Company (the items in clauses (i) through (iv) being
referred to collectively as the "Company Securities"). There are no
outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company Securities. There
are no shareholders agreements, voting trusts, registration rights agreements,
or other similar agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party with respect to the Company Securities.

(d) Section 4.05(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all outstanding Company Equity Awards as of not more than
five (5) Business Days prior to the date hereof, including with respect to
each such equity award, the holder, the number of shares of Company Stock
subject to such award (assuming target performance levels were achieved and
assuming vesting of any accrued but unpaid dividend equivalent rights relating
to such award, in each case, if applicable) and, for Company Stock Options,
the applicable exercise price, expiration date and whether such Company Stock
Option is an incentive stock option. Not more than five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with a revised
version of Section 4.05(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, updated as of
such date.

(e) The 2020 Convertible Notes mature on April 1, 2020 at which time the
Company is obligated to pay each holder of the 2020 Convertible Notes

Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to any projections,
forecasts or other estimates, plans or budgets of future revenues, future

or the future business, operations or affairs of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made available to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Representatives or

fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company
Board Recommendation (it being understood that any failure to publicly
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10) Business Days of

Recommendation for purposes hereof (provided that Parent makes such request
only after a material development has occurred that Parent believes, in good
faith, has created public uncertainty as to the position of the Board of
Directors of the Company or whether the Company Stockholder Approval will be
obtained and that Parent may only make such request once with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal that has not been amended with respect to financial or
other material terms)), (B) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement or (C) recommend, adopt or approve or publicly propose
to recommend, adopt or approve any Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing

Third Party or any Acquisition Proposal, or (v) fail to enforce, or grant any
waiver or release under, any standstill or similar agreement with respect to
any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. If

shall cause any of its Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct and its and its
Subsidiaries' Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be terminated
any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any
Third Party and its Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such Third Party and
its Representatives in possession of confidential information about the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the
Company in connection with a proposed Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry,
expression of interest, proposal or request for information that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy
all such information in accordance with the applicable confidentiality
agreements.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 6.04(a) to the contrary, if
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (and in no
event after obtaining Company Stockholder Approval), (i) the Board of
Directors of the Company receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
made after the date hereof which has not resulted from a breach of this
Section 6.04 that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, is or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii)
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law, then the Board of Directors of the Company, may, subject to compliance with this
Section 6.04(b), Section 6.04(c) and Section 6.04(e), (A) engage in
negotiations or discussions with such Third Party and its Representatives, (B)
furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, a copy of which shall be provided, promptly after
its execution, to Parent for informational purposes; provided that the Company
shall promptly provide to Parent any such information that is provided to any
such Person which was not previously provided to or made available to Parent
and (C) following receipt of a Superior Proposal after the date of this
Agreement, make an Adverse Recommendation Change. Nothing contained herein
shall prevent the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company from (x)
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the 1934 Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer), or (y) making any legally required disclosure
to stockholders with regard to the Transactions or an Acquisition Proposal
provided that any Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to an
Acquisition Proposal may only be made in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 6.04(b), Section 6.04(c) and Section 6.04(e) and even if
permitted by the foregoing, is subject to the rights of Parent set forth in
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, a "stop, look and listen"
disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the 1934 Act shall not be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

(c) In addition to the requirements set forth in Section 6.04(b), the Board of
Directors of the Company shall not take any of the actions referred to in
clauses (A) through (C) of Section 6.04(b) unless the Company shall have first
delivered to Parent written notice advising Parent that the Company intends to
take such action. The Company shall keep Parent promptly informed, on a
reasonably current basis, after taking any such action of the status and
material terms of any discussions and negotiations with the applicable Third
Party with respect to the Acquisition Proposal. In addition, prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company shall notify Parent
promptly (but in no event later one Business Day) after receipt by the Company
(or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access
to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries by any Third Party that, to the knowledge of the Company, is
considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall
be provided in writing and shall identify the relevant Third Party, to the
extent known, the material terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent informed, on a reasonably prompt basis
(but in no event more than one Business Day after actual receipt), of the
status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, (including any
material changes thereto) and shall provide to Parent copies of all material
correspondence and written materials sent or provided to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that describes any terms or conditions of any Acquisition
Proposal (as well as written summaries of any material oral communications
addressing such matters).

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (and in no event after the
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval), the Board of Directors of the
Company may effect an Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Company Intervening Event if
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under Applicable Law; provided that (i) the Company shall (A) promptly notify
Parent in writing of its intention to take such action (it being understood
that such a notification shall not, itself, constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change) and (B) negotiate in good faith with Parent (if
requested by Parent in writing) for five (5) Business Days following such
notice regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent, and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall not effect any
Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Company Intervening
Event unless, after the five (5) Business Day period described in the
foregoing clause (B), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

(e) Without limiting or affecting Section 6.04(a), Section 6.04(b) or Section
6.04(c), the Board of Directors of the Company shall not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Superior Proposal unless (i)
the Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing at least five (5) Business
Days before taking such action, that the Company intends to take such action,
which notice attaches the most current version of any proposed transaction
agreement or a summary of all material terms of such Superior Proposal and the
identity of the Third Party, (ii) if requested by Parent in writing, during
such five (5) Business Day period, the Company have negotiated in good faith
with Parent regarding any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this
Agreement in response to such Superior Proposal (and the Company shall have
instructed its Affiliates and Representatives, including its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, to the extent appropriate, to have engaged in
good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives) and (iii) after
such five (5) Business Day period, the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, taking into account any written proposal by Parent
received during such period to amend the terms of this Agreement, that such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that in the event of any amendment to the principal
financial terms or other material terms of any such Superior Proposal, a new
written notification from the Company consistent with that described in clause
(i) of this Section 6.04(e) shall be required and a new notice period under
clause (ii) of this Section 6.04(e) shall commence, during which notice period
the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this Section
6.04(e) anew, except that such new notice period shall be for two (2) Business
Days (as opposed to five (5) Business Days)).

(f) As used in this Agreement:

(i) "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality agreement
that contains provisions that are no less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.

all references to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal being deemed references to "50%" and clauses (ii)(2), (iii)(2) and (iv)(B)(2) being
disregarded) on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, and taking into account all the terms and conditions of the
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company considers to
be appropriate (including the identity of the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal and the expected timing and likelihood of consummation, any
governmental or other approval requirements, break-up fees, expense
reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation and availability of
necessary financing), would result in a transaction (i) that, if consummated,
is more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view
than the Merger (taking into account any proposal by Parent to amend the terms
of this Agreement agreed to be made in writing by Parent in response to such
Acquisition Proposal), (ii) that is reasonably capable of being completed on
the terms proposed, taking into account the identity of the Person making the
Acquisition Proposal, any approval requirements and all other financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and (iii) for
which financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then
fully committed or reasonably determined to be available by the Board of
Directors of the Company.

(iii) "Company Intervening Event" means any material event, change, effect,
development or occurrence occurring or arising after the date of this
Agreement that (i) was not known or reasonably foreseeable, or the material
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable, in each case
to the Board of Directors or executive officers of the Company as of or prior
to the date of this Agreement, and (ii) does not relate to or involve any
Acquisition Proposal; provided that in no event shall any (A) action taken by
either party pursuant to the affirmative covenants set forth in Section 8.01
or the consequences of any such action constitute, and (B) event, change,
effect development or occurrence that would fall within any of the exceptions
to the definition of "Company Material Adverse Effect" be deemed to contribute
to or otherwise be taken into account in determining whether there has been a
Company Intervening Event.

(g) Notwithstanding (i) any Adverse Recommendation Change, (ii) the making of
any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
until termination of this Agreement in no event may the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (A) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term
sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar instrument
constituting or relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with Section 6.04(b)), (B) except as
required by Applicable Law, make, facilitate or provide information in
connection with any SEC or other filings in connection with the transactions
contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal or (C) seek any Consents from
Governmental Authorities in connection with the transactions contemplated by
any Acquisition Proposal. Section 6.05 . Cooperation with Financing.

Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives), in each case to the
fullest extent permitted by Law and with appropriate contribution to the
extent such indemnification is not available, other than to the extent any
such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments or penalties are the result of bad faith or intentional willful
misconduct that is material by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
respective Representatives. Parent shall promptly, upon written request by the
Company, reimburse the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for all reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorney's fees) actually incurred by each such Person in connection with the
cooperation provided under this Section 6.05, or such Financing, whether or
not the Merger is consummated or this Agreement is terminated (and the
foregoing obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to have complied with their obligations under
this Section 6.05 for all purposes of this Agreement unless the Financing
actually sought by the Parent has not been obtained primarily as a result of
the Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' intentional and material breach of
its obligations under this Section 6.05.

Section 6.06 . Certain Indebtedness; Convertible Notes.

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, deliver all
notices and take all other actions required to facilitate (i) the repayment in
full of all obligations in respect of the 2020 Convertible Notes on April 1,
2020 in accordance with the terms of the 2020 Convertible Notes Indenture and
(ii) to the extent requested in writing by Parent and reasonably necessary to
consummate any Financing, and provided that the Company and its Subsidiaries
have sufficient cash available for such purposes, the termination, repayment,
or redemption of any other indebtedness for borrowed money incurred by any of
the Company and its Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement and the
repayment in full of all obligations in respect of such indebtedness (it being
understood that the Company shall promptly and in any event no later than ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date notify Parent of the amount of any
such indebtedness incurred or to be incurred and expected to be outstanding on
the Closing Date), and the release of any Liens securing any such indebtedness
described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) and guarantees in connection
therewith on the Closing Date.

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts
to comply with all of their respective obligations under the 2022 Convertible
Notes Indenture, including delivering any notices and entering into any
agreements, instruments, supplemental indentures and undertakings as required
pursuant to the 2022 Convertible Notes Indenture, and shall not amend,
supplement or modify any of the terms of the Convertible Note Indentures
without the prior written consent of Parent. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to timely provide or cause to be provided, in accordance with the provisions
of the 2022 Convertible Note Indenture, any certificates or legal opinions to
be provided in connection with the Merger prior to the Effective Time.

Section 6.07 . Transition. In order to facilitate the integration of the
operations of the Company and Parent and their respective Subsidiaries
following the Effective Time and to permit the coordination of their related
operations on a timely basis after the Effective Time, and in an effort to
accelerate to the earliest time possible after the Effective Time the
realization of synergies, operating efficiencies and other benefits expected
to be realized as a result of the Merger, upon Parent's written request, the
parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to jointly establish a
transition planning team of at least six members (the "Transition Team")
comprised of an equal number of representatives of Parent and the Company,
which shall be responsible for facilitating a transition and integration
planning process to ensure the successful combination of the operations of
Parent and the Company in accordance with, and solely to the extent permitted
by, Applicable Law. Upon Parent's request, the Transition Team shall be
responsible for developing and implementing a detailed action plan for the
combination of the businesses from and after the Effective Time and shall, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, use commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) confer on a regular and continued basis regarding the status of the
transition and integration planning process, (ii) communicate and consult with
its members with respect to the manner in which the respective businesses will
be conducted from and after the Effective Time and (iii) coordinate human
resources integration.

Section 6.08 . Insurance Matters.

(a) Reasonably promptly following the date hereof and in any event prior to
the expiration of such policies if requested in writing by Parent, the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to extend the policy expiry dates
for any claims-made and non-claims-made insurance policies of the Company in
effect as of the date hereof that would otherwise expire prior to the end of
the second fiscal quarter of the Company by a minimum of ninety days.

(b) Following the date hereof and prior to the Closing, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain six (6) year tail policies for any
of its claims-made insurance policies at the reasonable request of Parent, to
the extent available; provided that any such tail policies shall be contingent
upon the Closing. ARTICLE 7 
COVENANTS OF PARENT

Parent agrees that:

Section 7.01 . Conduct of Parent. Subject in all respects to Section 8.01 of
this Agreement, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, take any action or fail
to take any action that is intended to, or would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially
impede the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or the
other Transactions, including any financing thereof.

Section 7.02 . Obligations of Merger Sub. Subject in all respects to Section
8.01 of this Agreement, Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger
Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Section 7.03 . Voting of Shares. Parent shall vote all shares of Company Stock
beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of adoption of
this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

Section 7.04 . Director and Officer Liability. Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do
the following:

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless the present and former
directors, officers, employees, of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each
case, when acting in such capacity) (each, an "Indemnified Person") from and
against any losses, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement
(including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in
connection with or in respect of any thereof) in respect of the Indemnified
Persons' having served in such capacity prior to the Effective Time, in each
case to the fullest extent provided under the Company's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof or any indemnification
agreements in effect on the date hereof. If any Indemnified Person is made
party to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of
or relating to matters that would be indemnifiable pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, advance fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and
disbursements) as incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with and
prior to the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation; provided, that, such Indemnified Person to whom expenses are
advanced undertakes to Parent to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined by final non-appealable order that such Indemnified Person is not
entitled to indemnification.

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers, directors, employees,
fiduciaries and agents and advancement of fees, costs and expenses that are no
less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding
provisions in existence on the date of this Agreement.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies and the Company's existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), which
DandO Insurance shall (i) be for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim
related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time, (ii) be from
an insurance carrier with a substantially comparable credit rating as the
Company's current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance and (iii)
have terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
favorable than the coverage provided under the Company's existing policies
with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading
statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed
against an Indemnified Person by reason of his or her having served in such
capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby). If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to
obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the
date hereof with the Company's current insurance carrier or with an insurance
carrier with a substantially comparable credit rating as the Company's current
insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof,
or the Surviving Corporation shall purchase from the Company's current
insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with a substantially comparable
credit rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date hereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for the DandO Insurance or for any other
policies pursuant to this Section 7.04 an annual premium amount in excess of
300% of the premium amount per annum for the Company's existing policies; and
provided, further, that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.04. (e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.04 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

Section 7.05 . Employee Matters.

(a) For a period of 12 months following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each individual who
is employed by the Company or any Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each, a "Company Employee"), to the extent that such
individual remains employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after
the Effective Time (each, a "Continuing Employee"), (i) an annual base salary
or wage rate that is no less favorable than that annual base salary or wage
rate provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company or the applicable
Subsidiary in effect as of the Effective Time and (ii) severance benefits that
are no less favorable than those provided to such Continuing Employee by the
Company or the applicable Subsidiary as of the date hereof, subject to such
Continuing Employee signing and not revoking a release of claims in favor of
Parent and its Affiliates.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the period ending December 31, 2020,
Parent shall provide or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to each
Continuing Employee employee benefits, to the extent not otherwise described
in this Section 7.05, that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided to such Continuing Employee by the Company or the applicable
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that it
is understood that Parent's 401(k) match policy will apply to Continuing
Employees following the Effective Time and any differences between such policy
and the 401(k) match policy of the Company with respect to any defined
contribution plan shall not result in a breach of this Section 7.05(b). For
the avoidance of doubt, as of January 1, 2021 Parent shall cause each
Continuing Employee to become eligible to participate in Parent's employee
benefit plans on the same basis as a similarly situated employee of Parent
unless otherwise prohibited by any employee benefit plan or insurance contract
of Parent, the Company or any their respective Subsidiaries; provided, however
that to the extent that such eligibility would be prohibited under any
employee benefit plans or insurance contract of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to amend or otherwise allow such eligibility under such plan.

(c) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time (subject to meeting any service-based waiting time after giving
effect to the provisions of Section 7.05(e)), in any and all plans of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or their respective Affiliates ("Surviving
Corporation Plans") to the extent coverage under any such plan replaces
coverage under a comparable benefit plan in which such Continuing Employee
participates immediately prior to the Effective Time. (d) With respect to all Surviving Corporation Plans, including any "employee
benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or
any of its respective Subsidiaries (including any vacation, paid time-off and
severance plans), for all purposes (but not for benefit accrual under any
defined benefit plan or vesting under any equity compensation plan), including
determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting, benefit
accruals and early retirement subsidies, Parent shall cause each Continuing
Employee's service with the Company or any Company Subsidiaries (as well as
service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Company
Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized
by the Company or such Company Subsidiary) to be treated as service with
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, unless prohibited by any
employee benefit plan or insurance contract of Parent, the Company or any
their respective Subsidiaries; provided, however that to the extent that such
recognition would be prohibited under any employee benefit plans of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to amend or otherwise allow such recognition
under such plan and provided, further, that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication
of benefits for the same period of service.

(e) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in which any Continuing Employee is eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
(to the extent permitted under such welfare plan and Applicable Law) use
commercially reasonable efforts to, (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and exclusions and waiting periods and actively-at-work
requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries,
to the extent such limitations were waived, satisfied or did not apply to such
employees or eligible dependents or beneficiaries under the corresponding
welfare Company Plan in which such employees participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) provide Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents and beneficiaries with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous deductible or
out-of-pocket maximum requirements to the extent applicable under any such
plan.

(f) No later than twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date, Parent may
request that the Company terminate the Company 401(k) Plan, in which case, the
Company shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate the
Company 401(k) Plan effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
In the event of such termination, Parent shall permit each Continuing Employee
to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within
the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including all participant
loans) in cash or notes (in the case of participant loans) in an amount equal
to the eligible rollover distribution portion of the account balance
distributed to each such Continuing Employee from such plan to an "eligible
retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and shall make Continuing Employees eligible
for participation in such a plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as of
immediately after the Effective Time. (g) With respect to any Company Employees whose principal place of employment
is outside of the United States, Parent's obligations under this Section 7.05
shall be modified to the extent necessary to comply with Applicable Laws of
the foreign countries and political subdivisions thereof in which such Company
Employees primarily perform their duties.

(h) The provisions of this Section 7.05 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no Company Employee or any other Person
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any
purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement (except to the extent
provided in Section 11.06 with respect to Section 7.04), and no provision of
this Section 7.05 shall create such rights in any such Persons in respect of
any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Company
Plan or any compensation or benefit plan, program, agreement or policy of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall be construed as an
amendment to any Company Plan or compensation or benefit plan, program,
agreement or policy of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

The parties hereto agree that:

Section 8.01 . Regulatory Undertakings.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and

pursuant to the immediately foregoing proviso, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries will, without the prior written consent of Parent, become

(as defined below). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of
this Agreement, Parent shall not be required to (x) take or commit to take any
action that would reasonably be expected to result in changes to the business
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that, if in effect at the start of fiscal year 2019, would have
resulted in the reduction of the revenues of the Company, its Subsidiaries,
Parent and/or its Subsidiaries, by an amount in excess of $25,000,000 in the
aggregate, in the 2019 fiscal year or (y) take or commit to take any actions

in effect at the start of fiscal year 2019, would have resulted in the
reduction of the revenues of the Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent and/or its
Subsidiaries, by an amount not in excess of $25,000,000 in the aggregate, in
the 2019 fiscal year and (B) that would not result in incremental payments,
costs or expenditures (including reasonable counsel and advisor fees) to the
Company, its Subsidiaries, Parent and/or its Subsidiaries, on or after the
date hereof (but excluding any payments, costs or expenditures otherwise
incurred in connection with this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transaction), in excess of $12,500,000 in the aggregate in any fiscal year.

(b) Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and, to
the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject

restrictions, all the information relating to Parent and the Company, as the
case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Third Party or any
Governmental Authority in connection with Section 8.01(a). In exercising the
foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with
each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, Consents, Orders,
approvals, waivers, non-objections and authorizations (including the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals) of all Third Parties and Governmental Authorities
necessary or advisable to consummate the Transactions and each party will keep
the other apprised of the status of matters relating to consummation of the
Transactions, and each party shall consult with the other in advance of any
meeting or conference with any Governmental Authority in connection with the
Transactions and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, give

provided that each party shall promptly advise the other party with respect to substantive matters that are addressed
in any meeting or conference with any Governmental Authority which the other
party does not attend or participate in, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority and Applicable Law.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions with the United
States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof. Each of Parent and the Company shall (i)
respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from the FTC or
the Antitrust Division for additional information or documentation and to all

offer is accepted, commit to take) with respect to itself and the Company all
actions necessary to avoid or eliminate impediments under any antitrust,
competition, or trade regulation law that may be asserted by the FTC, the
Antitrust Division, any State Attorney General or any other Governmental
Authority with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions so as to
enable the consummation thereof as promptly as reasonably practicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the request of Parent, the Company shall
agree to divest, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action
that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,

action), provided that any such action shall be conditioned upon the

communication to that party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State
Attorney General or any other Governmental Authority and, subject to
Applicable Law, permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed
written communication to any of the foregoing; (2) not agree to participate in
any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning any competition or

to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other
parties the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; and (3) furnish the
other parties with copies of all correspondence, filings, and communications
(and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between them and their
Affiliates and their respective representatives on the one hand, and any

shall obligate or be construed to obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to, and without Parent's
prior written consent neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall,
make, or to cause to be made, any material payment or other material accommodation to any Third Party in order to obtain the Consent of such Third
Party under any Material Contract (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
Requisite Regulatory Approvals).

Business Days thereafter) mail or deliver the Proxy Statement to its
stockholders.

(b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in connection
with the preparation of the Proxy Statement, (ii) in determining whether any

thereto) and each time before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall
give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent

its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after receipt of those comments or
other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
Company's response to those comments and to provide comments on that response
(to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given). If at any
time prior to receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, any information should
be discovered by any party hereto which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement in order for the Proxy
Statement not to include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto, and, to the extent required by
Applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement
describing such information shall be promptly filed by the Company with the
SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Law, disseminated by the Company
to its stockholders.

any press release, having any communication with the press (whether or not for attribution),
making any other public statement or scheduling any press conference or
conference call with investors or analysts with respect to this Agreement or
the Transactions and, except in respect of any public statement or press

any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in

(b) Termination Fee.

(i) If this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to Section

a time when this Agreement was terminable by Parent pursuant to Section

be payable in the case of a termination (I) by Parent, within one Business Day
after such termination and (II) by the Company, immediately before and as a
condition to such termination.

(ii) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(b)(i) or Section 10.01(b)(iii) and: (A) at or prior to
termination of this Agreement an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly
disclosed or publicly announced or made known to the management or Board of
Directors of the Company, or any Person shall have publicly announced an

Stockholder Meeting; and (B) on or prior to the first (1st) anniversary of
such termination: (1) an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same one)
shall have been consummated; or (2) a definitive agreement relating to an
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not the same one) is entered into by the
Company (provided that for purposes of this clause (ii)(B), each reference to

available funds, concurrently with the occurrence of the applicable event
described in clause (B), the Termination Fee.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
Section 10.01(b)(iii), the Company shall reimburse Parent and its Affiliates,
no later than two Business Days after submission of documentation therefor,
for 100% of their reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including all

(d) Parent and Merger Sub agree that, upon any termination of this Agreement
under circumstances where the Termination Fee is payable by the Company
pursuant to this Section 11.04 and the Termination Fee is paid in full,
subject to the last two sentences of this Section 11.04(d) and except in the
case of Fraud, (i) Parent and Merger Sub shall be precluded from any other remedy against the Company, at law or in equity or otherwise and (ii)
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or

against the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members,
shareholders or Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection
with this Agreement or the Transactions. The parties acknowledge that the
agreements contained in this Section 11.04 are an integral part of the
Transactions, that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into
this Agreement and that any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 11.04 do
not constitute a penalty.

Section 11.05 . Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References. The parties
hereto agree that any reference in a particular Section of either the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to
be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) the
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant
party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and
any other representations and warranties of such party that is contained in
this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to
(or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties is
reasonably apparent on its face. The mere inclusion of an item in either the
Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule as an exception
to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such
item represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance
or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.
The parties hereto agree that in no event shall any disclosure solely
contained in any part of any Company SEC Document entitled "Risk Factors",

Statements", "Special Note on Forward Looking Statements" or "Forward Looking
Information" or containing a description or explanation of "Forward-Looking
Statements" (and not in any other part) be deemed to be an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) any representations and warranties of any party
contained in this Agreement.

Section 11.06 . Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment.

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns,
and subject to Section 11.06(c), no provision of this Agreement is intended to
confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder
upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns, other than: (i) with respect to the provisions of Section 7.04
which shall inure to the benefit of the persons or entities benefiting

of the parties hereto.

obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party

Manhattan, New York, New York, and any appellate court thereof and each party
hereto irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect to any such
Proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court, (ii) agrees that any

claims or rights against any Financing Parties relating to or arising out of
this Agreement, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or

not apply with respect to any claims or rights of the parties to any debt
commitment letters or engagement letters, none or which rights are or shall be
impaired hereby), (iv) agrees not to bring or support, or permit any of its
Affiliates or Representatives to bring or support, any Proceeding of any kind

to, this Agreement, the Financing, or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise (provided that,

arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Financing or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder, (ix) agrees that none of the Financing Parties will have any
liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives (in each case, other than Parent or its
Subsidiaries) relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of
any services thereunder, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise and (x) agrees that the Financing Parties are express third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce,
the provisions in this Section 11.06(c), Section 11.07, Section 11.08 and
Section 11.09, and that such provisions and any related definition used in
such sections or any provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment,
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the
substance of such sections and/or such provisions, shall not be amended,
modified, waived or terminated in any way adverse to the Financing Parties
without the prior written consent of the Financing Entities of the Financing

such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State
of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the parties hereby
irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection
that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit,
action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any
party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any
such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that service of
process on such party as provided in Section 11.01 shall be deemed effective
service of process on such party.

Section 11.10 . Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have

Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and
written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Section 11.12 . Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated
as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 11.13 . Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof or for any breach of the

an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to

and the parties further waive any requirement for the securing or posting of
