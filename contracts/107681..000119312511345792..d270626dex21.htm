SECTION 1.3 _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall

State of Florida, executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
FBCA, and, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, shall make any and all
other filings or recordings required under the FBCA to be made on the Closing
Date. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles of Merger
are duly filed with the Department of State of Florida or at such other date
or time on or after the date of filing of the Articles of Merger as Parent and
the Company shall agree in writing and shall specify in the Articles of Merger
(the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

SECTION 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement, the Articles of Merger and in the relevant

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended so that
they read in their entirety as set forth in  _Exhibit B_, and, as so
amended, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended.

 



2 SECTION 1.6 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified.

 

SECTION 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the

are duly elected and qualified.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE

 

CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

SECTION 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company
(such shares, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall thereupon be converted automatically
into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $9.50 in cash,
without interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter
only represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.3, without interest.

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and shall
become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation. 

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different class or
shall have different terms, as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
subdivision, combination, exchange, stock dividend, stock distribution, or
any other similar event, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such event so as to provide Parent and the holders of
Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event; _provided_ , that nothing in this paragraph (d) shall be construed
to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



3 SECTION 2.2 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_.

 

(a) Except as provided below, at the Effective Time, each option (each, a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") to purchase Shares granted under the 2012 Equity
Incentive Plan, the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan or the 2007 Equity Incentive
Plan (the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that is vested or that, upon consummation of the
Merger, will automatically vest in accordance with its terms, shall be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without
interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to
the product of (i) the excess (if any) of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per Share under such Company Stock Option and (ii) the number
of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option; _provided_ , that if the
exercise price per Share of any such Company Stock Option is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be
cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company Stock Options attributable to
outperformance awards (as defined in the Company Stock Plans or award
agreements thereunder) that are unvested at the Effective Time and that are
not automatically vested pursuant to their terms by virtue of the
Merger shall be forfeited as of the Effective Time, without any consideration
paid to the option holder.

(b) Except as provided below, at the Effective Time, each restricted stock
unit (" _RSU_ ") granted under the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is vested or that, upon
consummation of the Merger, will automatically vest in accordance with its
terms, shall become fully vested with respect to 100% of the Shares set forth
in the terms of the agreement granting such RSU and shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest, and
subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax) equal to the Merger
Consideration for each such fully earned and vested RSU. Notwithstanding the
above, any RSUs attributable to outperformance awards that are unvested
at the Effective Time and that are not automatically vested pursuant to their
terms by virtue of the Merger shall be forfeited as of the Effective Time,
without any consideration paid to the holder thereof.

 

(c) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall mail to
each holder of Company Stock Options and RSUs a letter describing the
treatment of and payment for such Company Stock Options or RSUs pursuant to
this Section 2.2 and providing instructions for use in obtaining payment for
such Company Stock Options or RSUs. Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, at all times from and after the Effective Time
maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy their obligations to holders of
Company Stock Options and RSUs pursuant to this Section 2.2.

 

(d) As of the Effective Time, any then current offering period under the
Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (" _ESPP_ ") shall be terminated and
any unused cash returned (without interest) to the ESPP participants, and no
further Shares shall be purchased thereunder.

(e) The Company shall take all reasonable actions necessary to ensure that, as
of the Effective Time, the Company Stock Plans and any agreements thereunder,
together with the ESPP and any other equity-based compensation or benefit
plan (collectively, the " _Company Equity Plans_ ") shall be terminated, and
all Company Stock Options, RSUs, and any other equity-based awards shall be
cancelled, at the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, no holder of a
Company Stock Option, RSU, or other equity-based award or any participant in
any Company Equity Plan shall have any rights to acquire the capital stock of
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries, or any
other rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the payment
contemplated by this Section 2.2 in cancellation and settlement thereof.

 



4 (f) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the third Business Day thereafter, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall pay (at Parents option, through the Companys payroll
system or through the Paying Agent) the amounts due and payable under this
Article II to each holder of Company Stock Options and RSUs.

(g) The Chief Executive Officer of the Company has not vested in the deferred
compensation units granted to him under the Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. 2006
Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended, and such units shall be cancelled and
forfeited at the Effective Time without any current or future consideration
therefor.

 

SECTION 2.3 _Exchange and Payment_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) select a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the paying agent in the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement
with the Paying Agent, the terms and conditions of which are satisfactory to
the Company in its reasonable discretion. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent, in trust for the
benefit of holders of Shares, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II (such cash,
the " _Payment Fund_ "). Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments due
pursuant to this Article II.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
third Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate (the "
_Certificates_ ") and, if required, each holder of uncertified Shares
represented by book entry (the " _Book-Entry Shares_ ") that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares that were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (i) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent, or in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and
which letter shall be in customary form and contain such other provisions as
Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Share to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may
reasonably require, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share (subject to
deduction for any required withholding Tax), and the Certificate or Book-
Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares on the Merger Consideration.

 



5 (c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax is
not applicable.

(d) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

(e) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.

(f) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis; _provided_ , that no such investment or
losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to any Person
under this Agreement and Parent shall promptly provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to promptly provide, additional funds to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of such Persons to the extent necessary to satisfy the
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 2.3(f).
Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent, upon demand.

 

(g) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares six months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any
remaining holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation as general creditors thereof for payment of
the Merger Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar laws).

(h) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Payment
Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall not have been exchanged prior to the date on which the related
Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect thereof shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



6 (i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent
may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

SECTION 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
payable to any holder of Shares, Company Stock Options, RSUs or otherwise
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made. 

SECTION 2.5 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if and to the extent appraisal rights are available in the
Merger to holders of Shares pursuant to Section 607.1302 of the FBCA, then:

(a) any Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
for which the holder thereof (i) has not voted in favor of the Merger or
consented to it in writing and (ii) is entitled to demand and has demanded the
appraisal of such Shares in accordance with, and has complied in all respects
with, Section 607.1302 of the FBCA (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_
"), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with Section 2.1 and, instead, shall be treated in accordance
with Section 607.1323 of the FBCA;

(b) the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such rights as
may be granted to them under Section 607.1302 of the FBCA;

(c) notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.5(a) and (b), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal rights
(through failure to perfect such appraisal rights or otherwise), then that
holders Shares (i) shall be deemed no longer to be Dissenting Shares and (ii)
shall be treated as if they had been converted automatically at the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Sections 2.1 and 2.3;

(d) the Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal of any Shares, any withdrawals of such demands and any other
instrument served on the Company relating to rights to appraisal and (ii) the
right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands for appraisal; and

 



7 (e) the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make
any payment with respect to, settle or offer to settle, or approve any
withdrawal of any such appraisal demands.

its face) or (b) in the Company SEC Documents filed on or after December 1,
2010 and publicly available as of the date of this Agreement (excluding any

operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary,

and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company has made available to Parent by posting in the Companys
electronic data room true and complete copies of the Companys articles of
incorporation (the " _Company Charter_ ") and bylaws (the " _Company Bylaws_
") and the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational

8 (ii) All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and

any Subsidiary of the Company. All outstanding shares of capital stock and
other voting securities or equity interests of each Subsidiary of the Company
have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid, nonassessable
and not subject to or issued in violation of any purchase option, call option,
right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar
right. All shares of capital stock and other voting securities or
equity interests of each such Subsidiary are owned, directly or indirectly,
by the Company, free and clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges,
options, rights of first refusal, encumbrances and security interests of any
kind or nature whatsoever (including any limitation on voting, sale, transfer
or other disposition or exercise of any other attribute of ownership)
(collectively, " _Liens_ ").

 

(iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding any
bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations having the right to vote (or
convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, securities having the
right to vote) with the shareholders of the Company or such Subsidiary on any
matter. Except as set forth above in this paragraph (a) and except for

exercise of Company Stock Options described in Section 3.2(b), there are no
outstanding (A) shares of capital stock or other voting securities or equity

Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of
capital stock of the Company or other voting securities or equity interests of

Subsidiaries or rights or interests described in the preceding clause (C), or
(E) obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any such securities or to issue, grant,
deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, granted, delivered or sold, any such
securities.

 



9 (iv) There are no shareholder agreements, voting trusts or other
agreements or understandings to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party or to which the Company has knowledge with respect to the holding,
voting, registration, redemption, repurchase or disposition of, or that
restricts the transfer of, any capital stock or other voting securities or
equity interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) _Company Stock Awards._

(i) Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all holders, as of the close of business on the Measurement
Date, of outstanding Company Stock Options, RSUs, rights to purchase Shares
under the ESPP, and other similar rights to purchase or receive Shares granted
under the Company Equity Plans or otherwise (collectively, " _Company Stock
Awards_ "), indicating as applicable, with respect to each Company Stock Award
then outstanding, the type of award granted, the number of Shares subject to
such Company Stock Award, the name of the plan under which such Company Stock
Award was granted, the date of grant, exercise or purchase price, vesting
schedule, payment schedule (if different from the vesting schedule) and
expiration thereof.

 

(ii) Each Company Stock Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock
option" under Section 422 of the Code so qualifies and the exercise price of
each other Company Stock Option is no less than the fair market value of a
Share as determined on the date of grant of such Company Stock Option. The
Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of all Company
Stock Plans and the forms of all stock option agreements evidencing
outstanding Company Stock Options and restricted stock agreements evidencing
outstanding RSUs. The Company Boards compensation committee, as
the administrator of the Company Equity Plans, has determined (within its
discretion as the administrator of the Company Equity Plans) that the Company
Stock Options (whether in-the-money or out-of-the-money) and RSUs can be
involuntarily cancelled without the award holders consent upon consummation
of the Merger in accordance with Section 2.2.

SECTION 3.3  _Subsidiaries_. Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth a true and complete list of each Subsidiary of the Company,
including its jurisdiction of incorporation or formation. Except for the
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, its Subsidiaries,
the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any equity, membership
interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest, or other equity or
voting interest in, or any interest convertible into, exercisable or
exchangeable for any of the foregoing, nor is it or any of its Subsidiaries
under any obligation to form or participate in, provide funds to, or make any
loan, capital contribution, guarantee, credit enhancement or other investment
in any Person.

SECTION 3.4 _Authority_.

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation
by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
the Company and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, subject, in the case of the consummation of
the Merger, to the approval of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of
the outstanding Shares (the " _Company Shareholder Approval_ "). This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms (except to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally or by general principles of equity).

 



10 (b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held at which all
directors of the Company were present, acting on the unanimous recommendation
of the Special Committee, duly and unanimously adopted resolutions (i)
determining that the terms of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby are in the best interests of the Company and
its shareholders, (ii) adopting, in accordance with the FBCA, and declaring
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, (iii) directing that this Agreement be submitted to the
shareholders of the Company for approval, and (iv) recommending that the
Companys shareholders vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, which resolutions
have not been subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way, except
as may be permitted by Section 5.3.

(c) The Company Shareholder Approval is the only vote of the holders of any
class or series of the Companys capital stock or other securities required in
connection with the Merger. No vote of the holders of any class or series of
the Companys capital stock or other securities is required in connection with
the consummation of any of transactions contemplated hereby other than the
Merger.

 

SECTION 3.5 _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_.

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
does not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and compliance by the Company with the provisions hereof
will not, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of, or result in, termination, cancellation, modification
or acceleration of any obligation under, or to the loss of a material benefit
under, or result in the creation of any Lien in or upon any of the properties,
assets or rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, or give rise
to any increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or
entitlements under, or require any consent, waiver or approval of any Person
pursuant to, any provision of (i) the Company Charter or Company Bylaws, or
the articles of incorporation or bylaws (or similar organizational documents)
of any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) any bond, debenture, note, mortgage,
indenture, guarantee, license, lease, purchase or sale order or other
contract, commitment, agreement, obligation, undertaking or other binding
arrangement (each, a " _Contract_ ") to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) subject
to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in Section 3.5(b),
any federal, state, local or foreign law (including common law), statute,
ordinance, rule, code, regulation, order, judgment, injunction, decree or
other legally enforceable requirement (" _Law_ ") or any rule or regulation of
The Nasdaq Stock Market (" _Nasdaq_ ") applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective properties or assets may be bound, except as, in the case of
clauses (ii) and (iii), as individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



11 (b) No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration, filing with or notice to, any federal, state, local or foreign
government or subdivision thereof or any other governmental, administrative,
judicial, arbitral, legislative, executive, regulatory or self-regulatory
authority, instrumentality, agency, commission or body (each, a "
_Governmental Entity_ ") is required by or with respect to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by the Company or the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby or compliance with the provisions
hereof, except for (i) the actions required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976 (together with the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the " _HSR Act_ "), (ii) such filings and reports as may be
required pursuant to the applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 3.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Company has filed with or furnished to the SEC on a timely basis all
forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents required to be
filed with or furnished to the SEC by the Company since December 1, 2008 (all
such documents, together with all exhibits and schedules to the foregoing
materials and all information incorporated therein by reference, the "
_Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective filing dates (or, if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on
the date of such filing), the Company SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and all other applicable federal securities Laws (including the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder), and none of the Company SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

 

(b) The financial statements (including the related notes and schedules
thereto) forming part of the Company SEC Documents (i) have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
(" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), (ii) comply as to
form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, and (iii)
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their respective
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments), all in accordance with GAAP and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC. Since the end of the Companys most
recently completed fiscal year, the Company has not made any material change
in the accounting practices or policies applied in the preparation of its
financial statements, except as required by GAAP, SEC rule or policy or
applicable Law.

 



12 (c) Since December 1, 2008, the Company has maintained disclosure controls

and a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act), in each case sufficient to
satisfy the requirements of the Exchange Act and such rules. Since December
1, 2008, the Company has disclosed to the Companys auditors and audit
committee (i) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting and (ii) all fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys
internal control over financial reporting. A true and complete copy of all
such disclosures has been previously made available to Parent.

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in the comment letters received from the SEC staff with respect to
the Company SEC Documents. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the
Company SEC Documents is subject to ongoing review or outstanding SEC comment
or investigation.

(e) Since December 1, 2008, the Company has been in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and regulations of Nasdaq.

(f) No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file any form, report,

SECTION 3.7 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether
accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, known or unknown, or due or to
become due, of a type required to be recorded or reflected on a balance sheet
under GAAP, that have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect, except (a) to the extent accrued or reserved against in the
most recent consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(or disclosed in the footnotes thereto) included in the Company SEC Documents
filed prior to the date hereof, (b) for liabilities and obligations incurred
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since the
date of such balance sheet, and (c) for liabilities and obligations expressly
contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. From June 29, 2011 through
the date hereof: (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice in all
material respects; (b) there has not been any change, event or development
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and (c) none of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action that, if taken after the date of
this Agreement, would constitute a breach of any of the covenants set forth in
Section 5.1 (other than paragraph (h) and (j) thereof). Since June 29, 2011,
the Company and its Subsidiaries have not made any capital expenditures that
were in excess of previously budgeted amounts as contemplated by the Companys
fiscal 2012 annual operating plan.

 



13 SECTION 3.9 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no action, suit,
claim, arbitration, investigation or other proceeding (each, an " _Action_ ")
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their respective properties or
assets, or any present or former officer, director or employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in such individuals capacity as such, other than
any Action commenced by a Person that is not a Governmental Entity that (a)
does not involve an amount in controversy that is material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (b) does not seek material injunctive
or other non-monetary relief against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
There is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their
respective properties or assets, or any present or former officer, director or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in such individuals
capacity as such, other than any Action that, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material

its Subsidiaries. This Section 3.18 does not relate to any tangible personal
property or real property, which is the subject of Section 3.17.

 



23 SECTION 3.19 _Company Charter; State Takeover Statutes_. The resolutions of
the Company Board referred to in Section 3.4 are sufficient to render Section
2 of the Company Charter and Sections 607.0901 and 607.0902 of the FBCA
inapplicable to Parent and Merger Sub and to this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby. No other provision of the Company
Charter or Company Bylaws, nor any "moratorium," "fair price," "business
combination," "affiliated transactions," "control share acquisition" or
similar provision of any state anti-takeover Law (collectively, including any
provisions of the Company Charter or Company Bylaws, " _Takeover Laws_ ") is,
or at the Effective Time will be, applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 3.20 _No Rights Plan_. There is no shareholder rights plan, "poison
pill" anti-takeover plan or other similar device in effect to which the
Company is a party or is otherwise bound.

SECTION 3.21 _Related Party Transactions_. No present or former director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of such Persons
Affiliates or immediate family members (each of the foregoing, a " _Related
Party_ "), is a party to any Contract with or binding upon the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets or has any
interest in any property owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
has engaged in any transaction with any of the foregoing within the last 12
months, other than in such Persons capacity as a director or officer of the
Company. No Related Party of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries owns,
directly or indirectly, any material interest in, or serves as an officer or
director or in another similar capacity of, any Person with which Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has any contractual or other business relationship
that is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 3.22 _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other Person, other than Goldman, Sachs and Co., the fees and expenses of which
will be paid by the Company, is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial
advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of the Company or any of its Affiliates. The Company has furnished
to Parent a true and complete copy of any Contract between the Company and
Goldman, Sachs and Co. pursuant to which Goldman, Sachs and Co. could be entitled
to any payment from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



24 SECTION 3.23 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Special Committee has
received the opinion of Goldman, Sachs and Co., dated the date of this
Agreement, to the effect that, as of the date hereof and subject to the
limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth in such opinion, the

Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to such holders. A signed
true and complete copy of such opinion has been or will promptly be provided
to Parent for information purposes only.

or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub.

 



26 SECTION 4.6 _Merger Sub; Ownership of Common Stock_.

 

(a) Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and has engaged in no business
other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is owned
directly or indirectly by Parent.

 

(b) None of Parent, Merger Sub, Sponsor or any of their Affiliates (including
direct and indirect parent companies and their Affiliates) (i) owns, directly
or indirectly, beneficially or of record, any shares of Common Stock (other
than shares, if any, that are owned by Affiliates who are natural persons
through mutual funds and other analogous investment vehicles over which they
do not possess control) or (ii) holds any rights to acquire or vote any shares
of Common Stock, except pursuant to this Agreement.

SECTION 4.7 _Financing_.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of (a) a
fully executed commitment letter (the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ "),
pursuant to which the lender parties thereto (each a " _Lender_ ") have
agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide or cause to
be provided the debt amounts set forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ ") and
(b) a fully executed equity commitment letter (the " _Equity Financing
Commitment_ " and, together with the Debt Financing Commitments, the "
_Financing Commitments_ "), pursuant to which Lone Star Fund VII (U.S.), L.P.
(the " _Sponsor_ ") has committed, subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, to provide equity financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein
(the " _Equity Financing_ " and, together with the Debt Financing, the "
_Financing_ ").

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Financing Commitments has
been amended or modified, no such amendment or modification is contemplated,
and the respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have
not been withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified. As of the date of this
Agreement, the Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of BI-LO
Holding, Parent and Merger Sub (in the case of the Debt Financing Commitment)
or Parent or Merger Sub (in the case of the Equity Financing Commitment) and,
to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto (except to the extent
that enforceability may be limited by the applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally or by general principles of equity). As of the
date hereof, none of BI-LO Holding, Parent or Merger Sub has knowledge of any
fact or occurrence existing on the date hereof that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to (i) result in any of
the conditions in the Financing Commitments not being satisfied or (ii)
otherwise result in the Financing not being available on a timely basis in
order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the
date hereof, neither the Sponsor nor any Lender has notified BI-LO Holding,
Parent or Merger Sub of its intention to terminate either of the Financing
Commitments or not to provide the Financing.

 



27 (c) Except for the Financing Commitments and fee letter (a complete copy of
which has been provided to the Company, with only fee amounts and certain
economic terms of the market flex provisions redacted (the " _Fee Letter_ ")),
as of the date hereof there are no side letters or other agreements to which
BI-LO Holding, Parent or Merger Sub is a party related to the Financing.
There are no conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing other than as set forth in the Financing Commitments and the Fee
Letter (the " _Disclosed Conditions_ "). Parent has advised the Company of
the maximum total amount of fees (including original issue discount) and
expenses payable by Parent and Merger Sub under the Debt Financing. No Lender
has any right to impose, and none of the Sponsor, any Lender, BI-LO Holding,
Parent or Merger Sub has any obligation to accept, any condition precedent to
such funding other than the Disclosed Conditions nor, except as set forth in
the Financing Commitments and the Fee Letter, any reduction to the aggregate
amount available under the Financing Commitments on the Closing Date (nor any
term or condition which would have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount
available under the Financing Commitments on the Closing Date). As of the
date of this Agreement, assuming compliance by the Company with the provisions
of Section 5.11 hereof, none of BI-LO Holding, Parent or Merger Sub has any
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis
any conditions to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, or that
the Financing will not be available to BI-LO Holding, Parent or Merger Sub on
the Closing Date.

(d) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs
obligation to consummate the Merger, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by
the Financing Commitments, if funded in accordance with the Financing
Commitments, together with other cash of BI-LO Holding, Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, will be
sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger upon the terms
contemplated by this Agreement, to refinance the Second Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement, dated March 18, 2011, by and among the Company, the lenders
party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as
administrative agent, to refinance the existing ABL Credit Agreement, dated
February 3, 2011, by and among BI-LO Holding, the lenders, other parties party
thereto and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as administrative agent and
collateral agent (collectively, the " _Refinancing_ "), and to pay all
related fees and expenses.

(e) BI-LO Holding, Parent or Merger Sub has paid in full any and all
commitment or other fees required by the Financing Commitments that are due on
or before the date hereof, and will pay, after the date hereof, all such
commitments and fees as they become due. It is not a condition to Closing
under this Agreement, nor to the consummation of the Merger, for Parent or
Merger Sub to obtain the Financing or any alternative financing.

(f) None of BI-LO Holding, Parent, Merger Sub, the Sponsor or their respective
Affiliates have (i) retained any financial advisor on a basis exclusive to
Parent, Merger Sub or the Sponsor (or any or all of them on a joint basis) or
(ii) entered into an exclusivity, lock-up or other similar agreement,
arrangement or understanding with any bank or investment bank or other
potential provider of debt or equity financing that would prevent
such provider from providing or seeking to provide such financing to any
third party in connection with a transaction relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 4.8 _Limited Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of
this Agreement, the Guarantor has delivered to the Company the Limited
Guarantee, dated as of the date hereof. As of the date hereof, the Limited
Guarantee is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Guarantor (except to the extent that enforceability
may be limited by the applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally or by general principles of equity).

 



28 SECTION 4.9 _Solvency_. Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions
to Parents and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger and (b)
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
Article III as of the Effective Time, immediately after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger, the
Financing, the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, any repayment of
existing indebtedness contemplated by this Agreement or the Financing
Commitments, and the payment of all related fees and expenses), the Surviving
Corporation will be Solvent. With respect to the Surviving Corporation, "
_Solvent_ " means that, as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" of the assets of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, exceeds, as of such date, the sum of all
"debts" of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
including contingent liabilities, as such quoted term is generally determined
in accordance with applicable federal Law governing determinations of the
insolvency of debtors; (ii) the Surviving Corporation will not have, as of
such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
business in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following the
Closing Date; and (iii) the Surviving Corporation will be able to pay its
debts, including contingent liabilities, as they mature.

SECTION 4.10 _Absence of Arrangements with Management_. Other than this
Agreement, there are no contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements,
obligations or understandings between Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys
management or the Company Board or their respective Affiliates, on the other
hand, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
operations of the Company after the Effective Time, and, as of the date
hereof, no material discussions have taken place between such Persons
regarding any such contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements,
obligations or understandings.

SECTION 4.11 _No Regulatory Impediment_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is not
aware of any fact relating to its or any of its Affiliates (including its
direct and indirect parent companies and their Affiliates) respective
businesses, operations, financial condition or legal status, including any
officers, directors or current employees status, that might reasonably be
expected to impair the ability of the parties to this Agreement to obtain, on
a timely basis, any authorization, consent, order, declaration or approval
of, or ability to contract with, any Governmental Entity or third party
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



29 SECTION 4.12 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledge and agree that except for the representations and warranties
contained in Article III, any certificate delivered pursuant to Article VI or
any letter of transmittal related to the Shares, none of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, or any stockholder or Representative of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries makes or has made any representation or warranty, either
express or implied, concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective assets or properties or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, except with
respect to the representations and warranties contained in Article III, any
certificate delivered pursuant to Article VI or any letter of transmittal
related to the Shares, none of the Company or its Affiliates, Subsidiaries,
stockholders or Representatives shall have any liability to Parent or Merger
Sub or their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, stockholders or
Representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or
state securities laws or otherwise) based upon any information or statements
(or any omissions therefrom) provided or made available by the Company or its
Affiliates, Subsidiaries, stockholders or Representatives to Parent or Merger
Sub or their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, stockholders or
Representatives in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees
that, as of the date hereof and to its knowledge, it has been furnished with,
or given adequate access to, all information and materials relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries that it has requested and Representatives of the
Company have answered all inquiries that Parent or Merger Sub has made of them
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries.

contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall
cause their Affiliates not to, without the Companys prior written consent,

would reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the Merger
set forth in Article VI not being satisfied on or before the Outside Date.

SECTION 5.3 _No Solicitation; Recommendation of the Merger_.

(a) The Company shall not, and shall not permit or authorize any of

Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal),
(2) such Acquisition Proposal was unsolicited and did not otherwise result
from a breach of this Section 5.3, (3) the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal, and (4) the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to take the actions
referred to in clause (I) or (II) below would be reasonably likely to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company
under applicable Florida Law, then the Company may (I) furnish information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement
containing terms substantially similar to, and no less favorable to the
Company than, those set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement (including
the standstill provisions thereof); _provided_ , that any non-public
information provided to such Person shall have been previously provided to
Parent or shall be provided to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently
with the time it is provided to such Person; and (II) participate in
discussions and negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

 



33 (b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

 

(i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub) the adoption, approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, (B) adopt,
approve, recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable the approval of
any Acquisition Proposal, or (C) resolve, agree or propose to take any such
actions (each such action set forth in this paragraph (i), an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "), or

 

(ii) (A) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into
any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract (each, an " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or which is intended to
or is reasonably likely to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or (B) resolve,
agree or propose to take any such actions.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval, the Company Board may, if the Company Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to
do so would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties
to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Florida Law, taking into
account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that are offered in
writing by Parent pursuant to this Section 5.3, (i) make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to either a Superior Proposal or an
Intervening Event, or (ii) solely in response to a Superior Proposal received
after the date hereof that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.3,
cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section
7.1(d)(ii) and concurrently enter into a binding Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to
a Superior Proposal or terminate this Agreement in response to a Superior
Proposal unless:

 

(i) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least five calendar days before
taking that action of its intention to do so, and specifies the reasons
therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the
Person making, such Superior Proposal, and contemporaneously furnishes a copy
(if any) of the proposed Alternative Acquisition Agreement and any other
relevant transaction documents (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notice by the Company and a new three
calendar day period); and

 



34 (ii) if Parent makes a proposal during such five (or three, as
applicable) calendar day period to adjust the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Company Board, after taking into consideration the adjusted
terms and conditions of this Agreement as proposed by Parent, continues to
determine in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its
financial advisor) that such Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior
Proposal and that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement, as applicable, would be reasonably likely to result
in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under
applicable Florida Law;

 

 _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company Board may not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event unless: 

(i) the Company provides Parent with written information describing such
Intervening Event in reasonable detail as soon as reasonably practicable
after becoming aware of it;

(ii) the Company keeps Parent reasonably informed of developments with
respect to such Intervening Event;

(iii) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least five calendar days
before making an Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such
Intervening Event of its intention to do so and specifying the reasons
therefor; and

 

(iv) if Parent makes a proposal during such five calendar day period to adjust
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board, after taking
into consideration the adjusted terms and conditions of this Agreement as
proposed by Parent, continues to determine in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel) that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation
Change would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Florida Law.

 



35 During the five (or three, as applicable) calendar day period prior to its
effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement as
referred to above, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal
advisors to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent seeks
to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 5.3(a)
and (b), the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of
receipt) advise Parent in writing in the event the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any indication by any Person
that it is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any inquiry or
request for information, discussion or negotiation that is or is expected to
be reasonably likely to lead to or that contemplates an Acquisition Proposal,
or (iii) any proposal or offer that is or is reasonably likely to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, in each case together with a description of the material
terms and conditions of and facts surrounding any such indication,
inquiry, request, proposal or offer, the identity of the Person making any
such indication, inquiry, request, proposal or offer, and a copy of any
written proposal, offer or draft agreement provided by such Person. The
Company shall keep Parent informed in all material respects on a timely basis
of the status and details (including, within 24 hours after the occurrence of
any material amendment or modification) of any such Acquisition Proposal,
request, inquiry, proposal or offer, including by furnishing copies of any
material written inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation, and
written summaries of any material oral inquiries or discussions. Without
limiting any of the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if it determines
to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.3 by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by the Company.

 

(e) Nothing contained in Section 5.3(a) shall prohibit the Company from taking
and disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14e2(a), Rule 14d9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section
14d9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change (including for purposes of Section 7.1(c)(iii)) unless
the Company Board expressly reaffirms its recommendation to the Companys
shareholders in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger in such
disclosure.

 



36 (f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer with respect to any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, and whether through any merger, reorganization, consolidation,
tender offer, self-tender, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset
acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture or otherwise, of (A) assets or
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries that generate 15% or more of
the net revenues or net income or that represent 15% or more of the total
assets (based on fair market value) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or (B) 15% or more of any
class of capital stock, other equity securities or voting power of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any resulting parent company of the
Company, in each case other than the Merger and other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide binding written Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and its financial advisor), taking into account all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the Person
making the proposal, including the financing terms thereof and the expected
timing of the consummation thereof, is (A) more favorable to the shareholders
of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any adjustment to the
terms and conditions proposed by Parent in response to such proposal) and (B)
reasonably likely of being completed on the terms proposed; _provided_ , that,
for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," references in the
term "Acquisition Proposal" to "15%" shall be deemed to be references to
"50%."

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means a material event or circumstance that was
not known to the Company Board prior to the execution of this Agreement (or if
known, the consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable),
which event or circumstance, or any material consequence thereof, becomes
known to the Company Board prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the receipt,
existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto
or consequence thereof constitute an Intervening Event.

 



37 SECTION 5.4 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Shareholders  Meeting_.

 

(a) Provided there shall not have been an Adverse Recommendation Change
specifically permitted by Section 5.3, as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement (and in any event within 20 Business Days after the
date hereof), the Company shall file the Proxy Statement with the SEC in
preliminary form as required by the Exchange Act, and shall use all
reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC. The
Company shall prepare the initial draft of the Proxy Statement. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company the information relating to it
required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall provide
Parent and Merger Sub with any comments that may be received from the SEC or
its staff with respect thereto, shall respond promptly to any such comments
made by the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement, and shall
cause the Proxy Statement in definitive form to be mailed to the Companys
shareholders at the earliest practicable date. The Proxy Statement shall not,
at the time it is first mailed to the Companys shareholders, at the time of
any amendments or supplements thereto and at the time of the Company
Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act. If at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, any information relating
to the Merger, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers should be discovered by the Company or
Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that such document would not contain any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and the Company shall promptly file with the
SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information and,
to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or
supplement to the shareholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company shall give Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and
shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. The letter to
shareholders, notice of meeting, proxy statement and form of proxy and any
other soliciting material to be distributed to shareholders in connection
with the Merger (including any amendments or supplements) and any schedules
required to be filed with the SEC in connection therewith are collectively
referred to as the " _Proxy Statement_."

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof (and, in any event, no
later than the 10th Business Day hereafter), the Company shall, in
consultation with Parent, mail "broker search cards" with respect to the
Company Shareholders Meeting. Provided there shall not have been an Adverse
Recommendation Change specifically permitted by Section 5.3, as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, the Company shall, in consultation with
Parent, duly call and establish a record date for a special meeting of its
shareholders (the " _Company Shareholders Meeting_ ") to be held solely for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval. Provided there
shall not have been an Adverse Recommendation Change specifically permitted by
Section 5.3, as promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared
by the SEC for mailing to the Companys shareholders, the Company shall give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting. The Company may
postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting from its originally
noticed date for a reasonable period (i) in order to solicit additional
proxies so as to establish a quorum or (ii) to allow time for the filing and
dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure documents which the
Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) is necessary to be filed and disseminated under
applicable Laws. Except in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change
specifically permitted by Section 5.3, the Company, through the Company
Board, shall (A) recommend to its shareholders that they approve this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (B)
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant
to the first three sentences of this paragraph (b) shall not be affected by
the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to
the Company or any other Person of any Acquisition Proposal.

 



38 SECTION 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours, during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all their respective
properties, assets, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and,
during such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent: (a) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities
laws, and (b) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request (including Tax
Returns filed and those in preparation and the workpapers of its auditors);
_provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the Company shall not be required to provide
such access if it reasonably determines that such access is reasonably likely
to materially disrupt or impair the business or operations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and (b) the foregoing shall not require the Company to
disclose any information to the extent it reasonably determines that such
disclosure is reasonably likely to (i) result in a waiver of attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or similar privilege, (ii) cause competitive
harm to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries if the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, or (iii)
violate any applicable Law or any confidentiality obligation of such party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case that such disclosure is prohibited
by applicable Law (including antitrust Law), Parent and the Company each
agree to use reasonable best efforts to establish a process that (through use
of steps such as targeted redactions, provision of information to counsel to
review and summarize for Parent or use of a "clean room" environment for
analysis and review of information by joint integration teams in coordination
with counsel and the Company) will provide Parent with timely access to the
fullest extent possible to the substance of the information described in this
Section 5.5 in a manner that allows the Company to comply with applicable Law.
All such information shall be held confidential in accordance with the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement among Hudson Americas LLC, BI-LO, LLC and
the Company dated as of February 28, 2011 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
"). No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.5 or information provided,
made available or delivered to Parent pursuant to this Agreement shall affect
any of the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the
conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereunder.

SECTION 5.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, and to cause its Affiliates (including Parents direct and indirect
parent companies and their Affiliates) to cooperate and use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following:

(i) obtain all required consents, approvals or waivers from, or participation
in other discussions or negotiations with, third parties, including as
required under any Material Contract;

 



39 (ii) obtain all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities,
make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings and take all steps
as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid any
Action by, any Governmental Entity, including making as soon as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, filings under the HSR Act;

 

(iii) provide as promptly as possible any additional information and
documentary materials that may be reasonably requested pursuant to the HSR
Act;

(iv) vigorously resist and contest any Action, including administrative
or judicial Action, and seek to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and that could restrict, prevent
or prohibit consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including by vigorously pursuing all avenues of
administrative and judicial appeal; and

(v) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement;

 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall commit to the payment of any fee, penalty or other consideration or
make any other concession, waiver or amendment under any Contract in
connection with obtaining any consent without the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). 

(b) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act or if any suit is instituted
by any Governmental Entity or any private party challenging the transactions
as violative of the HSR Act, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to (and shall cause its Affiliates, including Parents direct and indirect
parent companies and their Affiliates, to use their respective reasonable best
efforts to) resolve any such objection or challenge as such Governmental
Entity or private party may have to the transaction so as to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall (and shall cause its Affiliates,
including Parents direct and indirect parent companies and their Affiliates
to) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry including
any proceeding initiated by a private party and they each shall furnish to
each other party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such
other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.

 



40 (d) Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, Parent
and the Company shall each inform the other party of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental
Entity and each shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each shall consult with the other in connection with, all of the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of Parent and the Company
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Subject to applicable
Law and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent
shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to
the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other written
communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity or third party
with respect to such transactions, and, to the extent practicable under the
circumstances, shall provide the other party and its counsel with the
opportunity to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.6, the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Section 5.6 include the
obligation of Parent to, and to cause its Affiliates (including Parents
direct and indirect parent companies) to: (i) sell or divest or agree to sell
or divest any assets or businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries, BI-LO
Holding and its Subsidiaries and such Affiliates; (ii) agree to sell or divest
any assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries
contemporaneously with or subsequent to the Closing; (iii) permit the Company
to sell or divest any assets or businesses of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing; and (iv) license, hold separate or enter
into similar arrangements with respect to the assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, BI-LO Holding and its Subsidiaries, the Company and its
Subsidiaries and such Affiliates, in each case in exchange for obtaining the
expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act without further actions
being taken or any consent from any Governmental Entity necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and its Affiliates shall not be required
to take or consent to the taking of any such action that, individually or in
the aggregate, would reasonably be likely to cause the Debt Financing to be
unavailable at the Closing.

SECTION 5.7 _Takeover Laws_. Assuming the accuracy in all material respects of
Parents and Merger Subs representations and warranties in Section 4.6(b),
the Company and the Company Board shall (a) take no action to cause any
Takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) if any Takeover Law is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, take all action necessary to ensure that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Law with respect to this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any other notice or
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby, (c) any Action commenced or, to
such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or (d) any change,
condition or event that results or would reasonably be expected to result in
any failure of any condition set forth in Article VI to be satisfied
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect any
of the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the
conditions to the obligations of, the parties hereunder.

 



41 SECTION 5.9 _Employees; Benefit Plans._

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, provide to each individual
who, immediately prior to the Effective Time is an employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Employee_ ") (i) the same base salary or
hourly wage rate provided to such Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (ii) the same short-term (annual or more frequent) bonus or commission
opportunity provided to such Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (iii) other compensation and benefits (excluding equity and equity-
based awards, which will remain discretionary) that are no less favorable for
all Employees in the aggregate as those provided to such Employees in the
aggregate under the Companys and its Subsidiaries compensation and benefit
plans, programs, policies, agreements and arrangements in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, after the Effective Time, nothing herein shall preclude the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from terminating the
employment of any Employee for any lawful reason.

 

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, honor all Company Plans (including
all severance, change of control and similar plans and agreements) in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by
such Company Plans to the extent not in violation of any requirements
hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall prevent the
amendment or termination of any specific plan, program, policy, agreement or
arrangement, or interfere with Parents, the Surviving Corporations or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates rights or obligations to make
such changes as are necessary to comply with applicable Law. During the
Continuation Period, Parent shall provide each Employee who suffers a
termination of employment under circumstances that would have given the
Employee a right to severance payments and benefits under the Companys
severance policy in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Company Severance Plan_ ") with severance payments and benefits no less
favorable than those that would have been provided to such Employee under the
Company Severance Plan.

 



42 (c) For all purposes under all employee benefit plans (excluding (x) for
benefit accrual under any pension plans or (y) equity compensation plans) of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries and
Affiliates providing benefits to any Employee after the Effective Time (the "
_New Plans_ "), each Employee shall receive full credit for such Employees
years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective
Time (including predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for
which the Company and its Subsidiaries have given credit for prior service),
to the same extent as such Employee was entitled, prior to the Effective Time,
to credit for such service under any similar or comparable Company Plan and,
with respect to any New Plan for which there is no similar or comparable
Company Plan, to the same extent as such service would be recognized if it had
been performed as an employee of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates (in each case except to the extent such
credit would result in a duplication of accrual of benefits). In addition,
where applicable, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) at
the Effective Time, each Employee immediately shall be eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in each New Plan to the extent such
waiting time was satisfied under a similar or comparable Company Plan in which
such Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); (ii) Parent shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions or limitations and actively-at-work requirements
of each New Plan to be waived or satisfied for such Employee and his or her
covered dependents to the extent waived or satisfied under the analogous Old
Plan as of the Effective Time; and (iii) Parent shall cause all eligible
expenses incurred by each Employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(d) With respect to any accrued but unused vacation time to which any Employee
is entitled pursuant to the vacation policy applicable to such Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Vacation Policy_ "), Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, (i) allow such Employee to use such accrued
vacation (subject to any maximums which may prohibit the Employee from
accruing any new vacation time until such prior time is used), and (ii) if any
Employees employment terminates during the Continuation Period under
circumstances entitling the Employee to severance pay under the Company
Severance Plan, pay the Employee, in cash, an amount equal to the value of the
accrued vacation time.

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.9, whether express or implied, shall confer
upon any current or former employee of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any rights
or remedies including any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this
Section 5.9. No provision of this Section 5.9 is intended to modify, amend or
create any employee benefit plan of the Company, Parent, Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

SECTION 5.10  _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation existing in favor of
the current or former directors, officers and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and the fiduciaries of any Company Plans (the " _Indemnified
Persons_ ") as provided in (i) the Company Charter or Company Bylaws, (ii)
the certificates of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents
of such Subsidiaries, (iii) such Company Plans, or (iv) any agreements between
an Indemnified Person and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries and which is
included in the Company SEC Documents or listed in Section 5.10 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time,
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms for a period of six years after the Effective Time
or, if longer, for such period as is set forth in any such agreement with an
Indemnified Person, in each case with respect to any claims against such
Indemnified Persons arising out of such acts or omissions, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law.

 



43 (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy (a correct and complete
copy of which has been heretofore made available to Parent) for acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that Parent may
(i) substitute therefor policies of an insurance company the material terms of
which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material
respect to such directors and officers than the Companys existing policies as
of the date hereof, or (ii) request that the Company obtain prior to the
Effective Time such extended reporting period coverage under its existing
insurance programs; and _provided, further_ , that in no event shall Parent or
the Company be required to pay annual premiums for insurance under this
Section 5.10 in excess of 250% of the amount of the annual premiums paid by
the Company for fiscal year 2011 for such purpose (which fiscal year 2011
premiums are hereby represented and warranted by the Company to be as set
forth in Section 5.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter), it being understood
that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide as much coverage as may
be obtained for such 250% amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of
the arrangements contemplated by this Section 5.10(b), before the
Effective Time, the Company shall be entitled to purchase a "tail" directors
and officers liability insurance policy covering the matters described in
this Section 5.10(b) so long as the Company does not pay more than the amount
set forth on Section 5.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter, and, if the
Company elects to purchase such a policy before the Effective Time, then
Parents obligations under this Section 5.10(b) shall be satisfied so long as
Parent causes such policy to be maintained in effect for a period of six
years following the Effective Time.

(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified
Person against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments and fines
(and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements) incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the
fact that the Indemnified Person is or was an officer, director or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the foregoing
indemnification shall be unavailable if the Indemnified Person is determined
in a final non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to
have failed to act in good faith and in a manner such Indemnified Person
reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the Company or, in the case
of a criminal action or proceeding, to have had reasonable cause to believe
that such Indemnified Persons conduct was unlawful. In the event of any such
Action, each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to advancement of expenses
incurred in the defense of such Action; _provided_ , that any Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification
hereunder. In the event of any such Action, (i) each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Person in the
defense of any such Action and (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any Action pending or threatened in writing to which an Indemnified Person
is a party (and in respect of which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Person hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all
liability arising out of such Action.

 



44 (d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successor and assign of Parent or the Surviving Corporation assumes the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.10. 

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.10 shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
by, each Indemnified Person, his or her heirs and his or her legal
representatives.

SECTION 5.11  _Financing_.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
BI-LO Holding, LLC (" _BI-LO Holding_ ") to obtain the Debt Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitments and the Fee
Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained
therein, (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to BI-LO
Holding, Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Financing Commitments and the Fee
Letter that are within its or their respective Affiliates control (including
their respective direct and indirect parent companies and their Affiliates),
(iii) comply with its obligations under the Financing Commitments, and (iv)
consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing Date (it being understood
that it is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the Merger, for Parent or Merger Sub to obtain the Financing
or any alternative financing). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the immediately preceding sentence, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall
cause each of BI-LO Holding and the Sponsor and their respective Affiliates
to, take all actions reasonably necessary to maintain in effect the
Financing Commitments.

(b) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a regular basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its and BI-LO Holdings efforts to arrange
the Debt Financing (including promptly providing the Company with copies of
all definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing). Parent shall give
the Company prompt notice (i) of any material breach or default by any party
to any of the Financing Commitments or definitive agreements related to the
Financing of which Parent becomes aware, (ii) of the receipt of any written
notice or other written communication, in each case from any Financing Source
with respect to (A) any material actual or potential breach or default, or any
termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Commitments or
definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the
Financing Commitments or definitive agreements related to the Financing or (B)
any material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any of
the Financing Commitments or definitive agreements related to the Financing
with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the
Financing to be funded at Closing, and (iii) if at any time for any reason
Parent believes in good faith that it or BI-LO Holding will not be able to
obtain all or any material portion of the Financing on the terms and
conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the
Financing Commitments and the Fee Letter or definitive agreements related to
the Financing. As soon as practicable after the Company delivers to Parent a
written request, Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by
the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii) or
(iii) of the immediately preceding sentence.

  



45 (c) Parent and BI-LO Holding shall have the right from time to time to amend,
replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under the
Debt Financing Commitments, or substitute other debt or equity financing for
all or any portion of the Financing from the same or alternative Financing
Sources; provided, that any such amendment, replacement, supplement,
modification or waiver shall not (i) expand upon the conditions precedent to
the Financing as set forth in the Financing Commitments and the Fee Letter in
any way or (ii) be reasonably expected to prevent or cause any delay of the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (taking into account any market flex provisions). For purposes of
this Section 5.11, references to "Financing" shall include the financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments and the Fee Letter as permitted to
be amended or modified by this paragraph (c) and references to "Financing
Commitments" and "Debt Financing Commitments" shall include such documents as
permitted to be amended or modified by this paragraph (c). In the event any
portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) contemplated in the Debt Financing
Commitments and the Fee Letter, Parent shall promptly so notify the Company
and shall cause BI-LO Holding to use reasonable best efforts to promptly
obtain alternative financing on terms not materially less beneficial to BI-LO
Holding and Parent (as determined in the reasonable judgment of BI-LO Holding
and Parent, taking into account the flex provisions set forth in the Fee
Letter) and in an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger, the Refinancing
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event.

(d) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to use their
reasonable best efforts to, at Parents sole cost and expense, promptly
provide to Parent and Merger Sub all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the Financing (provided that such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries), including:

 

(i) participating in a reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-
on-one meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and
prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Financing and the Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel
of the Company and other members of senior management and Representatives of
the Company), presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting
sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Financing,

unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related statements of income,
stockholders equity and cash flows of the Company (or its predecessors, as

be prepared in accordance with GAAP (such information, the " _Required
Information_ ");

(v) providing all relevant information with respect to collateral and
providing access to Parent and its Financing Sources to allow them to conduct
audit examinations and appraisals with respect to such collateral;

and other like documentation customary for financing similar to the Debt
Financing (except that the Company shall not be required to obtain or provide
any legal opinions from any counsel to the Company);

(vii) executing and delivering, as of the Effective Time, definitive financing
documentation, including pledge and security documents and certificates,
documents and instruments relating to guarantees, collateral and other
matters ancillary to the Financing (including a customary certificate of the
Chief Financial Officer of the Company with respect to solvency matters), and
otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral and
the providing of the guarantees; provided that no obligation of the Company
under any such agreement, pledge or grant shall be effective until the
Effective Time;

(viii) cooperating reasonably in facilitating the termination of the Second
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated March 18, 2011, by and among the
Company, the lenders party thereto, and Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, as administration agent, and obtaining all documentation
reasonably requested by the Financing Sources evidencing the termination of
such Indebtedness and the release of all related liens;

 



47 (ix) cooperating reasonably in facilitating the cancellation and replacement,
or rollover into the Debt Financing, of all outstanding letters of credit and

termination of such Indebtedness and the release of all related liens; and

(x) taking at the Effective Time all corporate actions reasonably necessary to
permit the consummation of the Debt Financing and to permit the proceeds
thereof, together with the cash at the Company and its Subsidiaries, to be
made available to Parent on the Closing Date to consummate the Merger.

The Company will periodically update the Required Information included in any
bank information or other similar offering memorandum to be used to obtain the
Debt Financing in order to ensure that such Required Information does not
contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
misleading.

(e) The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos
in connection with the Debt Financing so long as such logos are used solely in
a manner that is not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage
the Company and its Subsidiaries. 

(f) Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all documented and reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
by the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with their cooperation as
described in this Section 5.11. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree
that the Company and its Affiliates and their respective Representatives
shall not have any responsibility for, or incur any liability to any Person
under or in connection with, the arrangement of the Financing or any
alternative financing that Parent or Merger Sub may raise in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement if the Closing does not
occur. Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all damages suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information
utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided in writing
by the Company or its Subsidiaries expressly for use in connection
therewith). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.11, the
Company shall not be required to become subject to any obligations or
liabilities with respect to any document or agreement prior to the Effective
Time. 

(g) The obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.11 are the sole
obligations of the Company with respect to the Debt Financing and no other
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to expand or modify such
obligations.

hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably

Section 5.6(e) permitting Parent and its Affiliates not to take any such
actions that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be likely to

the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party set forth in this Agreement or any document

such waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed
and delivered by a duly authorized officer on behalf of such party. No failure
or delay of any party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce
such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and
remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any
rights or remedies which they would otherwise have hereunder.

_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this

all references herein to Parent or Merger Sub shall be deemed references to
such other Affiliate, except that all representations and warranties made

shall be deemed to be representations and warranties made with respect to such
other Affiliate as of the date of such assignment or (b) after the Effective
Time, to any Person. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

 

SECTION 8.10 _Specific Performance_.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly,
subject to Sections 8.10(b) and (c), the parties acknowledge and agree that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall be
entitled to specific performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to draw down
the Equity Financing or to consummate the Merger only if:

(i) all conditions in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied;

(ii) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to complete the Closing by the date
the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 1.2;

(iii) the Debt Financing has been funded or is expected to be funded at the

the Closing); and

(iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is
granted and the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then the
Closing will occur.

 



64 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall be
entitled to specific performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to draw down
the Debt Financing (or any replacement debt financing) only if the Closing
(including consummation of the Merger) will occur substantially simultaneously
with such draw down. 

(d) Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided
herein on the basis that (i) it has an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

 

(e) In no event shall the exercise of the Companys right to seek specific
performance pursuant to this Section 8.10 reduce, restrict or otherwise limit
the Companys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i)
or 7.1(d)(iii) and be paid the Closing Failure Fee.

SECTION 8.11 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
