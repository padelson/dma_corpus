Closing Date Balance Sheet, (ii) a statement (the "Net Working Capital
Statement") setting forth its calculation of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital and the components and calculations thereof, by reference to the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, and (iii) a statement (the "Net Working Capital
Adjustment Statement") setting forth the calculation of the amount by which
the Closing Date Net Working Capital as shown on the Net Working Capital
Statement either (A) exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital (as such amount
may be adjusted below, the "Net Working Capital Excess Amount") or (B) is
less than the Estimated Net Working Capital (as such amount may be adjusted
below, the "Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount").

 

(c) After receipt of the Net Working Capital Statement and the Net Working
Capital Adjustment Statement, the Sellers Representative shall have thirty
(30) calendar days to review the Net Working Capital Statement and the Net
Working Capital Adjustment Statement. Buyer shall give, or cause to be given,
to the Sellers Representative reasonable access to all documents and records
of the Group Companies used in their preparation. Not later than thirty (30)
calendar days following the date of receipt of the Net Working Capital
Statement and the Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement, the
Sellers Representative shall provide Buyer with a written notice (a "Working
Capital Dispute Notice") listing those items, if any, to which the Sellers
Representative takes exception, which notice shall also (i)
specifically identify, and provide a reasonably detailed explanation of, the
basis upon which the Sellers Representative has delivered such list,
including, without limitation, the applicable provisions of this Agreement on
which the dispute set forth in such Working Capital Dispute Notice is based,
(ii) set forth the amount of Closing Date Net Working Capital that the
Sellers Representative has calculated based on the information contained in
the Net Working Capital Statement, and (iii) specifically

 



19  identify the Sellers Representatives proposed adjustment(s). Unless the
Sellers Representative delivers the Working Capital Dispute Notice to Buyer
setting forth the specific items disputed by the Sellers Representative on
or prior to the thirtieth (30th) day following the Sellers Representatives
receipt of the Net Working Capital Statement and the Net Working Capital
Adjustment Statement, the Sellers Representative on behalf of the Sellers
shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Net Working Capital
Statement and the Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement and such statements
(and the calculations contained therein) shall be final, binding and
conclusive. If the Sellers Representative timely provides Buyer with a
Working Capital Dispute Notice, the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall,
within fifteen (15) days following receipt of such Working Capital Dispute
Notice by Buyer (the "Resolution Period"), attempt to resolve their
differences with respect to the items specified in the Working Capital Dispute
Notice (the "Disputed Items"), and all other undisputed items (and all
calculations relating thereto) shall be final, binding and conclusive. Any
written resolution by the Sellers Representative and Buyer during the
Resolution Period as to any Disputed Items shall be final, binding
and conclusive.

(d) If the Sellers Representative and Buyer do not resolve all Disputed Items
by written resolution by the end of the Resolution Period, then all Disputed
Items remaining in dispute shall be submitted within fifteen (15) days
following the expiration of the Resolution Period to Deloitte LLP (the
"Neutral Arbitrator"); _provided_ that if at such time either the Sellers
Representative or Buyer shall discover a bona fide conflict with respect to
the Neutral Arbitrator or the Neutral Arbitrator resigns or expressly states
its refusal for any reason to resolve the Disputed Items in accordance with
this _Section 2.6_, the Parties shall submit the matter to another
independent accounting firm of international reputation reasonably acceptable
to both the Sellers Representative and Buyer to resolve the
remaining matters in dispute, and such firm shall be the Neutral Arbitrator
for all purposes of this _Section 2.6(d)_. The Neutral Arbitrator shall act
as an arbitrator to determine only those Disputed Items remaining in dispute,
consistent with this _Section 2.6_, and shall request a statement from each
of the Sellers Representative and Buyer regarding such remaining Disputed
Items. The Neutral Arbitrator shall consider only those Disputed Items that
the Sellers Representative on the one hand and Buyer on the other hand are
unable to resolve. In resolving any disputed item, the Neutral Arbitrator may
not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by any Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by
any Party. The scope of the disputes to be arbitrated by the Neutral
Arbitrator is limited to whether the preparation of the Net Working Capital
Statement and the Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement were done in
accordance with this Agreement, and whether there were mathematical errors in
the preparation of the Net Working Capital Statement and the Net Working
Capital Adjustment Statement, and the Neutral Arbitrator is not to make
any other determination. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any,
to be performed by the Neutral Arbitrator shall be allocated between the
Sellers Representative and Buyer in the same proportion that the aggregate
amount of the Disputed Items so submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator that is
unsuccessfully disputed by such Party (as finally determined by the Neutral
Arbitrator) bears to the total amount of such Disputed Items so submitted by
such Party. In addition, the Parties shall give the Neutral Arbitrator access
to all documents, records and employees as reasonably necessary to perform its
function as arbitrator. The Neutral Arbitrator shall deliver to the Sellers
Representative and Buyer a written determination (such determination to
include a work sheet

 



20  setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such
determination and to be based solely on information provided to the Neutral
Arbitrator by the Sellers Representative and Buyer) of the Disputed Items
submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator within thirty (30) days following receipt
of such Disputed Items (or as soon thereafter as practicable), which
determination shall be final, binding and conclusive, and judgment may be
entered on the award.

(e) The final, binding and conclusive Net Working Capital Statement and Net
Working Capital Adjustment Statement, in each case, based either upon
agreement by the Sellers Representative and Buyer, the written determination
delivered by the Neutral Arbitrator in accordance with this _Section 2.6_ or
the Sellers Representatives failure to notify Buyer, in accordance with
this _Section 2.6_, of its objections to either the Net Working Capital
Statement or the Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement (or any calculations
contained therein) shall be the "Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement"
and the "Conclusive Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement," respectively.
If either the Sellers Representative or Buyer fails to submit a
statement regarding any Disputed Items submitted to the Neutral Arbitrator
within the time determined by the Neutral Arbitrator or otherwise fails to
give the Neutral Arbitrator access as reasonably requested, then the Neutral
Arbitrator shall render a decision based solely on the evidence timely
submitted and the access afforded to the Neutral Arbitrator by the Sellers
Representative and Buyer.

 

(f)(i) Buyer shall pay an aggregate amount, if any, equal to the Net Working
Capital Excess Amount, if any, set forth on the Conclusive Net Working
Capital Adjustment Statement, which amount shall be paid to the Sellers or
(ii) the Sellers Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release to
Buyer from the Escrow Account an amount equal to the Net Working
Capital Deficiency Amount, if any, set forth on the Conclusive Net Working
Capital Adjustment Statement. Any required payment under this _Section
2.6(f)_ shall be paid on the third (3rd) Business Day following the
determination of the Conclusive Net Working Capital Statement by (x) check or
wire transfer of immediately available funds to each Seller of such Sellers
portion of such amount as set forth on _Exhibit 2.3(c)_ (in the case of a Net
Working Capital Excess Amount), or (y) wire transfer to such bank account or
accounts as Buyer (in the case of a Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount)
may specify. Any Net Working Capital Excess Amount shall be deemed to be an
increase in the Transaction Consideration and any Net Working Capital
Deficiency Amount shall be deemed to be a decrease in the Transaction
Consideration for purposes of this Agreement. In the event the Escrow Amount
is insufficient to satisfy any obligations to pay Buyer pursuant to this
_Section 2.6(f)_, Buyer shall have the right (in addition to any other rights
or remedies available to Buyer under law), but not the obligation, to
withhold and off-set such amount from the Subsequent Consideration payments,
if any.

2.7.  _Escrow Amount_.

(a) _Escrow Amount_. At the Closing, $500,000 of cash and 185,687 shares of
Buyer Common Stock (together, the "Escrow Amount") shall be deposited into an
escrow account (the "Escrow Account") established with JP Morgan Chase Bank,
National Association (the "Escrow Agent") to be held by the Escrow
Agent, pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreement attached as _Exhibit B_
hereto (the "Escrow Agreement"), to serve as a source of payment for any
amount due to Buyer for any claim for Damages for which any Buyer
Indemnified Party is entitled to recovery pursuant to _Article VII_ and
amounts payable to Buyer

 



21  pursuant to _Section 2.6(f)_. In connection with such deposit of the Escrow
Amount into the Escrow Account with the Escrow Agent, each Seller shall be
deemed to have received and deposited with the Escrow Agent such Sellers
pro-rata interest in the Escrow Account as determined as of the Closing by
reference to _Exhibit 2.3(c)_ , without any act of such Stockholder.

 

(b) _Release of Escrow Amount_. Promptly following the Escrow Expiration Date,
the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Sellers Representative, who shall
proceed to distribute to the Sellers in accordance with the percentage amounts
to which each Seller is entitled under this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, as set forth on _Exhibit 2.3(c)_ , the Escrow Amount
then remaining in the Escrow Account (including accrued interests and other
income) to such accounts designated by the Sellers _minus_ the aggregate
dollar amount of claims for Damages made by all Buyer Indemnified Parties
pursuant to _Article VII_ hereof (the "Aggregate Outstanding Claims") which
are then outstanding and unresolved (such amount of the retained Escrow
Amount, as it may be further reduced after the Escrow Expiration Date by
distributions to the Sellers Representative as set forth below and
recoveries by the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Article VII_ hereof
and the Escrow Agreement, the "Retained Escrow Amount"). For purposes of
clarification, in the event that the amount of the Aggregate Outstanding
Claims exceeds the remaining Escrow Amount, all the remaining Escrow Amount
shall be retained in the Escrow Account as the Retained Escrow Amount. In the
event and to the extent that after the Escrow Expiration Date any outstanding
claim made by any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to _Article VII_ hereof is
resolved against such Buyer Indemnified Party, the Escrow Agent shall
distribute to the Sellers Representative, who shall proceed to distribute to
the Sellers in accordance with the percentage amounts to which each Seller is
entitled under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, as set forth on
_Exhibit 2.3(c)_ , to such accounts designated by the Sellers an aggregate
amount of the Retained Escrow Amount equal to the amount of the outstanding
claim resolved against such Buyer Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such distribution shall only be made to the extent that the
Retained Escrow Amount remaining after such distribution would be sufficient
to cover the amount of the Aggregate Outstanding Claims that are still
unresolved at such time. In the event and to the extent that after the Escrow
Expiration Date any outstanding claim made by any Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Article VII_ hereof is resolved in favor of such Buyer
Indemnified Party, such Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover
pursuant to _Article VII_ hereof an amount equal to the amount of the
outstanding claim resolved in favor of such Buyer Indemnified Party.

(c) _Escrow Agent Fees and Expenses_. Any administrative fees and expenses of
the Escrow Agent shall be paid by Buyer. During the period in which the Escrow
Amount (including any Retained Escrow Amount) is retained in the Escrow
Account, all interest or other income earned from any investment of the
Escrow Amount (the "Escrow Earnings") shall be retained as additional amounts
in the Escrow Account.

 

(d) _Per Share Price_. Any shares of Company Common Stock used to satisfy any
claims made against the Escrow Account, or otherwise released from the Escrow
Account, shall be valued at the Per Share Price.

 



22 2.8. _Sellers  Representative_.

 

(a) _Appointment_. As used in this Agreement, the term "Sellers
Representative" shall mean Sofinnova Capital V FCPR, or any Person appointed
as a successor Sellers Representative pursuant to _Section 2.8(b)_ hereof.
Sofinnova Capital V FCPR hereby accepts his, her or its appointment as the
initial Sellers Representative. Effective upon the Closing, without any
further action by any other Person, the Sellers Representative shall be
appointed and constituted in respect of each Seller, as his, her or its agent,
to act in his, her or its name, place and stead, as such Sellers attorney-
in-fact, as more fully set forth in _Section 2.8(c)_.

(b) _Election and Replacement_. From and after the Closing Date until the
date when all obligations under this Agreement have been discharged (including
all indemnification obligations under _Article VII_ hereof), the Sellers who
are entitled to receive in excess of 50% of the Transaction Consideration
(the "Majority"), may, from time to time upon written notice to the Sellers
Representative and Buyer, remove any Sellers Representative (including any
appointed by Buyer as provided below) or appoint a new Sellers
Representative to fill any vacancy created by the death, incapacitation,
resignation or removal of any Sellers Representative. In the event of a
vacancy, the Sellers will promptly appoint a successor
Sellers Representative hereunder. A copy of any appointment by the Majority
of any successor Sellers Representative shall be provided to Buyer promptly
after it shall have been effected. Each successor Sellers Representative
shall have all of the power, authority, rights and privileges conferred by
this Agreement upon the original Sellers Representative, and the term
"Sellers Representative" as used herein shall be deemed to include any
successor Sellers Representative.

(c) _Authority_. Each Seller hereby irrevocably approves the constitution and
appointment of, and hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Sellers
Representative with all of the rights, powers and obligations contemplated by
this _Section 2.8_ as its sole, exclusive, true and lawful agent,
representative and attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitutions, for
and on behalf of such Seller, with respect to any and all matters arising out
of this Agreement following the Closing and the Escrow Agreement, including
for purposes of taking any action or omitting to take any action on behalf of
such Seller. For this purpose each Seller hereby irrevocably undertakes to
take any step or sign any document necessary to timely and fully implement the
provisions set forth in this Section 2.8, also in order to formally grant to
the Sellers Representative any power of attorney to validly bind the Sellers
in the jurisdiction where the relevant obligation must be fulfilled under this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Sellers Representative shall
be authorized, on behalf of the Sellers, (i) to discuss, negotiate, resolve
and fully and finally settle on behalf of the Sellers any claims for
indemnification hereof, including the authorization to comply with orders of
courts with respect to any such claim for indemnification, to dispute the
status of any unachieved Milestone, (ii) to review the Net Working Capital
Statement and the Net Working Capital Adjustment Statement, deliver a Working
Capital Dispute Notice and discuss, negotiate, resolve and fully and finally
settle on behalf of the Sellers any disputes with respect to the Closing Date
Net Working Capital pursuant to _Section 2.6_ hereof, (iii) to take any
action, including litigating, defending or enforcing any actions and to make,
deliver and sign any certificate, notice, consent or instrument required or
permitted to be made or delivered under this Agreement or under the documents
referred to in this Agreement (an "Instrument") which the Sellers
Representative determines in his or her discretion to be necessary,
appropriate or desirable, and, in connection therewith ( _provided_ ,

 



23   _however_ , if any individual Seller is named in such litigation, the
Seller shall have the right to tender defense), (iv) to hire or retain, at the
sole expense of the Sellers, such counsel, investment bankers, accountants,
representatives and other professional advisors as he, she or it determines in
his, her or its sole and absolute discretion to be necessary, advisable or
appropriate in order to carry out and perform his or her rights and
obligations hereunder, (v) to take any action for the benefit of the Sellers
directly or indirectly connected to the provisions of this Agreement,
including receiving any portion of the Escrow Amount and distributing to
the Sellers the amounts to which each Seller is entitled under this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement, and (vi) to receive all documents, certificates and
notices and make all determinations on behalf of the Sellers required under
this Agreement. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers
Representative shall constitute a decision of the Sellers and shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon the Sellers, as the case may be. Any Party
receiving an Instrument from the Sellers Representative shall have the right
to rely in good faith upon such Instrument and to act in accordance with the
Instrument without independent investigation. Buyer shall be entitled to
disregard any notices or communications given or made by the Sellers unless
given or made through the Sellers Representative. The Sellers Representative
shall promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business Days, provide
written notice to each Seller of any action taken on behalf of the Sellers by
the Sellers Representative pursuant to the authority delegated to the
Sellers Representative under this _Section 2.8_.

 

(d) _No Liability of the Sellers  Representative or Buyer_. Neither the
Sellers Representative (nor any of the directors, officers, agents or
employees of the Sellers Representative, if applicable) shall be liable to
any Seller or any other Person for any error of judgment, or any action taken,
suffered or omitted to be taken, under this Agreement, except in the case of
the Sellers Representatives fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The Sellers Representative may consult with legal counsel, independent public
accountants and other experts selected by the Sellers Representative and
shall not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted to be taken
in good faith in accordance with the advice of such counsel, accountants or
experts. As to any matters not expressly provided for in this Agreement,
the Sellers Representative shall not be required to exercise any discretion
or take any action. Buyer (and the Group Companies) shall have no liability to
any of the Sellers or otherwise arising out of the acts or omissions of the
Sellers Representative or any disputes among the Sellers or between the
Sellers and the Sellers Representative. Buyer may rely entirely on its
dealings with, and notices to and from, the Sellers Representative to satisfy
any obligations it might have under this Agreement or otherwise to the
Sellers.

(e) _Indemnity; Costs and Expenses_. Each Seller shall, only to the extent
of and in proportion to the portion of the Transaction Consideration received
by such Seller, indemnify and defend the Sellers Representative and hold the
Sellers Representative harmless against any loss, damage, cost, liability or
expense incurred without fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct by the
Sellers Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance, performance or administration of the Sellers Representatives
duties under this Agreement. Any liabilities, losses, penalties, fines,
claims, damages, out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by or reasonably
expected to be incurred by the Sellers Representative in connection with the
acceptance, performance and administration of his or her duties as the
Sellers Representative pursuant to this Agreement (including the hiring of
legal counsel, accountants or auditors and other advisors pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement but excluding 

 



24  any of the foregoing arising out of the Sellers Representatives fraud,
gross negligence or willful misconduct) and all fees payable hereunder to the
Sellers Representative by the Sellers ("Sellers Representatives Costs"),
shall be paid as follows: (i) first by recourse to the Sellers
Representatives Fund; (ii) if such amounts are insufficient to pay such
Sellers Representatives Costs, then by recourse to the Subsequent
Consideration that becomes payable to the Sellers; and (iii) if such amounts
are insufficient to pay such Sellers Representatives Costs, then by recourse
directly to the Sellers (in proportion to the pro rata portion of the
Transaction Consideration otherwise to be received by such Sellers).

(f)  _Access to Information_. If requested by Sellers Representative, Buyer
shall provide to the Sellers Representative on a semi-annual basis a written
report concerning the status of the Development Product, including any
unachieved Milestones. Buyer shall promptly (but no later than five (5)
Business Days following the achievement of a Milestone) notify the Sellers
Representative of the achievement of any Milestone. At the request of the
Sellers Representative, upon reasonable notice and at a reasonable time and
location, the Sellers Representative shall be entitled to ask, and have
answered, reasonable questions about the status of the Development Product.
The Sellers Representative covenants and agrees to keep secret and retain in
strictest confidence, and shall not furnish, make available or disclose to any
third party (other than the Sellers) or use for the Sellers Representatives
own benefit or the benefit of any third party, any Confidential Information,
unless such information (i) was or becomes available to the public from a
source other than the Sellers Representative or any Affiliate of the Sellers
Representative, (ii) is requested to be disclosed by a Governmental Authority
or required by Applicable Law or legal process (in which case the Sellers
Representative shall, to the extent reasonably practicable and legally
permissible, provide Buyer with advance notice of such required or requested
disclosure, shall use commercially reasonable efforts (at Buyers sole cost
and expense) to resist such disclosure, and, at the request of Buyer, shall
cooperate with Buyer, at Buyers sole cost and expense, to limit or prevent
such disclosure), or (iii) becomes available to the Sellers Representative
after the date hereof on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the
Group Companies, provided, that that such other source is not known by the
Sellers Representative to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or
other obligation of confidentiality to Buyer or any of its Affiliates with
respect to such information. Buyer shall not provide Sellers Representative
with any material non-public information without first obtaining Sellers
Representatives prior written consent that it wishes to receive such material
non-public information. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Sellers Representative shall not be permitted to furnish, make available or
disclose confidential information received pursuant to this _Section 2.8(f)_
to any Person (other than to the Sellers (but excluding any assignee or
transferee of any Seller)) reasonably determined by Buyer to be a competitor
of Buyer with respect to the Development Product.

(g)  _Dispute Resolution_.

(i) In the event that the Sellers Representative shall dispute the status of
any unachieved Milestone or a request for indemnification or setoff under
this Agreement, then the Sellers Representative shall provide written notice
to Buyer (the "Dispute Notice") specifying the amount disputed and the basis
for the dispute. Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall thereafter
attempt to resolve the dispute as set forth in this _Section 2.8(g)_.

 



25 (ii) The Sellers and Buyer shall attempt to resolve any dispute arising out of
or relating to this Agreement promptly by negotiation in good faith between
an agent chosen for the Sellers by the Sellers Representative (who may be the
Sellers Representative) and an executive officer of Buyer who has authority
to settle the dispute. Each Party shall give the other Party involved written
notice of any dispute not resolved in the Ordinary Course of Business. Within
seven (7) days following delivery of such notice, the Party receiving notice
shall submit to the other a written response thereto. The notice and the
response shall include: (i) a statement of each Partys position(s) regarding
the matter(s) in dispute and a summary of arguments in support thereof, and
(ii) the name and title of the executive officer who shall represent Buyer
and any other Person who shall accompany that executive officer, in the case
of Buyer, or the name of the agent who shall represent the Sellers and any
other Person who shall accompany that agent, in the case of the Sellers.

(iii) Within fourteen (14) days following delivery of the notice, the
designated agent chosen by the Sellers Representative and the designated
executive officer of Buyer shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place,
and thereafter, as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to attempt to
resolve the dispute. All reasonable requests for information made by one
Party to the other shall be honored in a timely fashion. All negotiations
conducted pursuant to this _Section 2.8(f)_ (and any of the Parties
submissions in contemplation hereof) shall be kept confidential by the
Parties and shall be treated by the Parties and their representatives as
compromise and settlement negotiations under the Federal Rules of Evidence and
any similar state rules.

 

(iv) In the event that the Sellers and Buyer are unable to resolve any dispute
arising out of this Agreement in accordance with provisions (1), (2) and (3)
of this _Section 2.8(g)_ within six months of delivery of any Dispute Notice,
Buyer and the Sellers shall submit such dispute for final adjudication in
accordance with _Section 8.13_.

 

ARTICLE III.

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

As a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement, except as
disclosed in the disclosure schedule delivered to Buyer by the Company and
the Sellers concurrently herewith (the "Disclosure Schedule") (it being
understood that the Disclosure Schedule shall be arranged in sections
corresponding to the sections contained in this Agreement, and the
disclosures in any section of the Disclosure Schedule shall qualify the
representations in the corresponding section of this _Article III_ and shall
be deemed made in any other section or sections of the Disclosure Schedule to
the extent the relevance of such disclosures is readily apparent from the
text of such disclosure), the Company hereby makes the following
representations and warranties to Buyer as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date.

its contracts. Each Group Company is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is

 



26  in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties
owned, leased or operated or the nature of its activities make such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect on any Group Company.
Copies of the deed of incorporation and current bylaws of each Group Company,
which incorporate all amendments thereto, have heretofore been delivered to
Buyer and are accurate and complete as of the date hereof. No Group Company is
in violation of its deed of incorporation or bylaws.

 

3.2. _Subsidiaries_. Except for the Company Subsidiary, the Company does not

been duly approved by the board of directors or other competent body of the

to authorize this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and is the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms except as enforcement may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws

investment, or otherwise engage in any business involving, the items set
forth on _Exhibit 6.6(a)_.

(b) The Sellers agree that a monetary remedy for a breach of the agreement

equitable remedies, Buyer shall be entitled to such injunctive relief,
including temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions and permanent

effect in accordance with their terms for a period of six (6) years from the
Closing Date.

 

(b) At or prior to the Closing, Buyer shall purchase a six (6) year non-
cancellable "tail" prepaid directors and officers liability insurance

the Covered Persons than the policies maintained as of the date hereof (the
"DandO Tail"), effective as of the Closing.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Covered Persons, their heirs,
legatees, representatives, successors and assigns, it being expressly agreed
that the Covered Persons shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section
6.8_ and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Covered Person may have by
contract or otherwise.

assigns (i) consolidates or mergers into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger

any Tax period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations and shall make them available to the
Sellers Representative in connection with any audit of the Company which
could give rise to an indemnification obligation of any of the Sellers. The
Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to use any available
Tax credit that may reduce Pre-Closing Taxes consistent with Applicable Law.

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges

likelihood of payment of, or impose additional restrictions on the payment of
the EMA Subsequent Payment Amount, the MA Subsequent Payment Amount or the
Sales Subsequent Payment Amount. Buyer shall not, and will not permit its
Subsidiaries (including after the Closing, the Group Companies) to, create a

the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations (including any
extensions thereof). Any claims under this Agreement with respect to a breach
of a representation and warranty must be asserted by written notice within the
applicable survival period contemplated by this _Section 7.1_, and if such
notice is given, the survival period for such representation and warranty
shall continue until the claim is fully resolved. The right to indemnification
or other remedy based on the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements herein shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with
respect to, or any knowledge (or capable of being acquired) at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

7.2.  _Indemnification_.

(a)(i) Subsequent to the Closing, subject to the provisions of this _Article
VII_ , including the limitations described below in _Section 7.5_, each of
Buyer and its respective Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Group
Companies) and each of its and their respective officers, directors,
employees, stockholders and agents (the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") shall be
indemnified and reimbursed by the Sellers severally (in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Percentages) from and against any and all damage, claim,
loss, cost, liability or expense, including interest, penalties, reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses of investigation, response action, removal action
or remedial action (collectively, "Damages") incurred by such Buyer
Indemnified Party that arise out of (v) any breach of any representation or
warranty made by the Company in _Article III_ ; (w) any failure to perform any
covenant or obligation made by the Company in this Agreement; (x) any Pre-
Closing Taxes; or (y) any Buyer Indemnified Partys enforcement of its rights
under this _Section 7.2(a)(i)_.

(ii) Subsequent to the Closing, subject to the provisions of this _Article
VII_ , including the limitations described below in _Section 7.5_, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified and reimbursed by the Sellers,
severally and not jointly, from and against any and all Damages incurred by
such Buyer Indemnified Party that arise out of (x) any breach of any
representation or warranty made by such Seller in _Article IV_ ; (y) any
failure to perform any covenant or obligation made by such Seller in or
pursuant to this Agreement; or (z) any Buyer Indemnified Partys enforcement
of its rights under this _Section 7.2(a)(ii)_.

 

(iii) Subsequent to the Closing, subject to the provisions of this _Article
VII_ , including the limitations described below in  _Section 7.5_, Buyer
shall indemnify and reimburse each Seller and its respective Affiliates and
each of its and their respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders
and agents (the "Seller Indemnified Parties" and collectively with the Buyer
Indemnified Parties, the "Covered Parties") from and against any and all
Damages asserted against, suffered, sustained, accrued or incurred by such
Seller Indemnified Party arising out of (x) any breach of any representation
or warranty made by Buyer in _Article V_ ; (y) any failure to perform any
covenant or obligation made by Buyer in or pursuant to this Agreement; or (z)
any Seller Indemnified Partys enforcement of its rights under this _Section
7.2(a)(iii)_.

 



53 (b) The term "Damages" as used in this _Article VII_ is not limited to
matters asserted by third parties against the Covered Parties, but includes
Damages actually incurred or sustained by such persons in the absence of
third-party claims, and payments by a Covered Party shall not be a condition
precedent to recovery, and shall be net of any insurance proceeds or other
recoveries actually received that relate to the event giving rise to such
Damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Damages" shall not include
any punitive, incidental, consequential, special or indirect damages,
including loss of future revenue or income, or loss of business reputation or
opportunity, except, in each case, for any such damages awarded to a third
party in third-party claims.

 

7.3. _Notice of Claims_. Any Covered Party seeking indemnification hereunder
shall, within the relevant limitation period provided for in _Section 7.1_
above, give to the Party which is obligated pursuant to this _Article VII_ to
provide indemnification as set forth herein (the "Indemnifying Party") a
notice (a "Claim Notice") describing in reasonable detail the facts giving
rise to any claims for indemnification hereunder and shall include in such
Claim Notice (if then known) the amount or the method of computation of the
amount of such claim, and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or
any agreement, certificate or instrument executed pursuant hereto or in
connection herewith upon which such claim is based; _provided_ that a Claim
Notice in respect of any action at law or suit in equity by or against a
third Person as to which indemnification shall be sought shall be given
promptly after the action or suit is commenced; and _provided_ _further_ that
failure to give such notice shall not affect such Covered Partys right
to indemnification hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
shall have been materially prejudiced by such failure.

7.4.  _Third Person Claims_. If a claim by a third Person is made against a
Covered Party, and if such party intends to seek indemnity with respect
thereto under this _Article VII_ , such Covered Party shall promptly notify
the Indemnifying Party in writing of such claims, setting forth such claims
in reasonable detail. The Indemnifying Party shall have twenty (20) days
following receipt of such notice to deliver to the Covered Party a written
acknowledgement that such claim is an indemnifiable claim under this _Article
VII_ , that it shall undertake, conduct and control (in accordance with the
terms hereof), through counsel of their own choosing and at their own expense,
the settlement or defense thereof, and the Covered Party shall cooperate with
them in connection therewith; _provided_ , _that_ , the Covered Party may
participate in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such
Covered Party and paid at its own expense, _provided_   _further_ that, if in
the reasonable opinion of counsel for Indemnifying Party, there is a
reasonable likelihood of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party
and the Covered Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible
for reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to such Covered Party in
connection with such defense. The Covered Party shall not pay or settle any
such claim without the consent of the Sellers Representative with respect to
claims where the Sellers are the Indemnifying Party and Buyer where Buyer is
the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not deliver to the
Covered Party a written acknowledgement that such claim is an indemnifiable
claim under this _Article VII_  within such twenty (20) days, the Covered
Party shall have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement
of the claim but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor
pursuant to this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall not, except with the
consent of the Covered Party, enter into any settlement that is not
exclusively monetary paid entirely by the Indemnifying Party and does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the person or
persons asserting such claim

 



54  to all Covered Parties of an unconditional release from all liability with
respect to such claim or consent to entry of any judgment. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control any claim
relating to Taxes of Buyer or its Subsidiaries, or the Group Companies for any
Tax period ending after the Closing Date and shall not be entitled to settle,
either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim
for Taxes which could adversely affect the liability of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries, or the Group Companies for Taxes for any Tax period (or portion
thereof) after the Closing Date, without the prior written consent of Buyer. 

7.5. _Limitations on Indemnity; Payments Out of Subsequent Consideration_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything expressed or implied in this _Article VII_ to the
contrary, no Covered Party shall be entitled to make a claim for
indemnification pursuant to _Sections 7.2(a)(i)(v)_, _7.2(a)(ii)(x)_ or
_7.2(a)(iii)(x)_ of this Agreement unless and until the aggregate of all
Damages suffered by such Covered Party hereunder exceeds $1,000,000
(the "Deductible Amount"), at which point the Covered Party shall only be
entitled to indemnification for amounts in excess of the Deductible Amount.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Deductible Amount shall apply to (i)
the Companys representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 3.1_ ,
_3.2_ , _3.3_ , _3.4_ , _3.11_ and _3.23_ hereof (ii) any Sellers
representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 4.1_ ,  _4.2_ , _4.7_ ,
_4.8_ , _4.9_ , _4.10_ , _4.11_ , and _4.12_ hereof, or (iii) Buyers
representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 5.1_ , _5.2_ and _5.7_.

 

(b) In the event of a claim for indemnification or reimbursement under
_Section 7.2(a)(i)_, the amount of the related Damages (after taking into
account the limitations of _Section 7.5(a)_) shall be paid pursuant to and
solely by means of deductions, first, from the Escrow Account and then, to the
extent that the amount of the Damages are in excess of the amount available
in the Escrow Account or the Escrow Agreement has terminated pursuant to its
terms, as an offset against the Subsequent Consideration payments, if any,
when payable; _provided_ that with respect to claims for indemnification
pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)(v)_, Damages shall be indemnifiable up to an
aggregate maximum amount of $20,000,000 (which amount shall include all
deductions from the Escrow Account and offsets against Subsequent
Consideration payments);  _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , with respect
to claims related to breaches of Sellers representations and warranties set
forth in _Section 3.4_, Damages shall be indemnifiable up to an aggregate
maximum amount (after taking into account all other claims for
indemnification under this Agreement) of up to the aggregate consideration
paid by Buyer to the Sellers, and Buyer may seek recovery directly against
each Seller up to an amount (after taking into account all other claims for
indemnification under this Agreement) equal to the portion of the aggregate
consideration paid by Buyer to such Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(c) In the event of a claim for indemnification or reimbursement under
_Section 7.2(a)(ii)_, the amount of the related Damages (after taking into
account the limitations of _Section 7.5(a)_) shall be paid directly from the
applicable Seller. In addition, Buyer may choose to deduct from the Escrow
Amount up to such Sellers share of the Escrow Amount as set forth on
_Exhibit 2.3(c)_ or withhold from the Subsequent Consideration payable to such
Seller, if any, up to such Sellers share of the Subsequent Consideration as
set forth on _Exhibit 2.3(c)_. Each Sellers liability for payments pursuant
to _Section 7.2(a)(ii)(x)_ shall be limited to an aggregate amount (after
taking into account all other claims for indemnification under this Agreement)
equal to the portion of the aggregate consideration received by Seller
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



55 (d) In the event of a claim for indemnification or reimbursement under 
_Section 7.2(a)(iii)_, the amount of the related Damages (after taking into
account the limitations of _Section 7.5(a)_) shall be paid directly by Buyer.
Buyers liability for payments pursuant to  _Section 7.2(a)(iii)(x)_ shall
in no event exceed the Transaction Consideration that would have been paid
absent such breach.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in all cases determining
whether there has been a breach of a representation or warranty for purposes
of _Section 7.2(a)(i)(v)_, _7.2(a)(ii)(x)_ or _7.2(a)(iii)(x)_ , or in
determining the amount of any Damages with respect to such breach, such
representations and warranties (other than the representations and warranties
in _Sections 3.6(x)_ , _3.7_ , _3.9_ , _3.17_ and _3.24_ ) shall be read
without regard to any materiality qualifier (including, without limitation,
any reference to Material Adverse Effect) contained therein.

 

(f) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, any payment made by a Person
indemnifying a Covered Party pursuant to this _Article VII_  shall be treated
on the Parties Tax Returns as an adjustment to the Transaction Consideration
for all Tax purposes.

(g) Any payment of Damages made pursuant to this _Article VII_ shall be paid
by the Indemnifying Party without reduction for any tax benefits available to
the Covered Party. To the extent that the Covered Party recognizes tax
benefits as a result of any payment of Damages made pursuant to this _Article
VII_ , the Covered Party shall pay the amount of such tax benefits (but not in
excess of such payment of Damages made pursuant to this _Article VII_ ) to the
Indemnifying Party as such tax benefits are actually recognized by the
Covered Party. For this purpose, the Covered Party shall be deemed to
recognize a tax benefit with respect to a taxable year if, and to the extent
that, the Covered Partys cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of
such taxable year, calculated by excluding any Tax items attributable to the
payment of Damages made pursuant to this _Article VII_ from all taxable years,
_exceeds_ the Covered Partys actual cumulative liability for Taxes through
the end of such taxable year, calculated by taking into account any Tax items
attributable to the payment of Damages made pursuant to this _Article VII_ for
all taxable years (to the extent permitted by relevant Tax law and treating
such Tax items as the last items claimed for any taxable year).

7.6. _Remedies_. The remedies in this _Article VII_  shall be the sole and
exclusive remedies of the Parties with respect to any breach of the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise arising out of this Agreement, regardless of
the theory or cause of action pled, except for the remedies of specific
performance, injunction and other equitable relief; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no Party hereto shall be deemed to have waived any rights, claims, causes
of action or remedies if and to the extent actual fraud is proven on the part
of a Party by another Party hereto or such rights, claims, causes of action or
remedies may not be waived under Applicable Law.

Commerce (ICC) which are deemed to form part of this Agreement.

 

(b) There shall be three arbitrators, one selected by the party initiating the
arbitration (either Sellers Representative on behalf of Sellers or Buyer, as
applicable) in the request for arbitration, the second selected by mutual
agreement of the other party (either Sellers Representative on behalf of
Sellers or Buyer, as applicable) within 20 days of the delivery of
the request for arbitration, and the third (who shall act as chairperson of
the arbitration tribunal) selected by the two party appointed arbitrators
within 20 days of the selection of the second arbitrator. In the event that
the respondent fails to select an arbitrator, or if the two party appointed
arbitrators are unable or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, the
International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce
shall designate the remaining arbitrator(s) required to comprise the
tribunal. The claimant in the arbitration shall provide a copy of the request
for arbitration to the respondent at the time such request is submitted to the
Secretariat of the International Chamber of Commerce.

 

(c) The place of arbitration shall be London, United Kingdom. The language of
the arbitral proceedings and of all submissions and written evidence shall be
English; _provided_ , however, that a Party, at its expense, may provide for
translation or simultaneous interpretation into a language other than English.

 

(d) The arbitrators shall issue an award within nine months of the submission
of the request for arbitration of any dispute.

 



60 (e) It is expressly understood and agreed by the parties that the rulings and
award of the tribunal shall be conclusive and binding on the parties, their
successors and permitted assigns. Judgment on the award rendered by the
tribunal may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

 

(f) The parties agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in a
confidential manner. The parties shall (i) not publicly disclose
any information regarding the arbitration or any award issued in the
arbitration, except as may be required by Applicable Law; and (ii) keep all
material used or exchanged in the arbitration confidential and agree that any
such material shall be used solely for the purposes of the arbitration, and
shall not be used for any business, commercial, competitive or other purpose.

(g) The party that does not prevail in the arbitration proceeding shall pay
the arbitrators fees and any administrative fees of arbitration.
