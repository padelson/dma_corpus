CONSIDERATION

issue, respectively, to US HoldCo (or any Subsidiary of Group designated by
Group in writing no later than two Business Days prior to the Closing) the
following (the " _ _Purchase Price__ "):

 

(i) an amount in cash determined in accordance with Section 3.01(b) (the " _
_Cash Consideration__ "); and

(ii) a number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock, free and clear of
any Liens, determined in accordance with Section 3.01(c) (the " _ _Share
Consideration__ ").

The Cash Consideration and the Share Consideration are referred to
collectively in this Agreement as the " _ _Consideration__ ".

(b) The amount of the Cash Consideration shall equal the sum of (A) (i)
$6,200,000,000 (the " _ _Base Cash Consideration__ "), (ii) an amount in cash
determined in accordance with Section 3.01(c)(ii)(y) (the " _ _Additional
Cash__ "), if any, (iii) to the extent applicable, an amount in cash equal to
the amount of any equity contribution made by Sellers or their Affiliates
(other than the Sales Package Companies) to the Bank after the date hereof
and prior to the Closing at the request or direction of the OTS, the OCC or
the Federal Reserve, as to which reasonably satisfactory evidence is produced
as to the making of such contribution and the reasons therefor, and minus (B)
to the extent applicable, an amount equal to the adjustment as set forth in
Section 6.18(b). In addition, there shall be added to the amount of the Cash
Consideration the amount of any Positive IABF Adjustment Factor and there
shall be subtracted from the amount of the Cash Consideration the amount of
any Negative IABF Adjustment Factor.

(c) The Share Consideration shall be 55,921,710 shares of Purchaser Common
Stock, subject to adjustment in accordance with this Section 3.01(c).

 

(i) If the Share Consideration does not exceed 9.9%, of the Outstanding shares
of Purchaser Common Stock on the Closing Date (the " _ _Voting Stock Cap__
"), then no Additional Cash shall be paid; provided, however, that Sellers
shall have the right to decrease the Voting Stock Cap upon written notice to
Purchaser at least three 

 



17  Business Days prior to Closing, to a lower percentage (but not less than
9.7%) to accommodate beneficial ownership of Purchaser Common Stock by Sellers
and their Affiliates at that time and in such event all references to "Voting
Stock Cap" herein shall be deemed to refer to such lower percentage.

(ii) If the Share Consideration exceeds the Voting Stock Cap (such excess, the
" _ _Excess Shares__ "), then: (x) the Share Consideration shall be reduced to
that number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to the Voting Stock Cap
and (y) Purchaser shall, in addition to the Base Cash Consideration and the
Share Consideration as adjusted pursuant to clause (x), pay to the Sellers an
additional amount in cash equal to product of (i) the Excess Shares and (ii)
the average, rounded to the nearest one tenth of a cent, of the closing sale
prices of Purchaser Common Stock on the NYSE as reported by the Wall Street
Journal for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of the
Effective Time.

(d) At the Closing, there shall be calculated and agreed by the Parties an
amount that represents the adjustment to shareholders equity of the Bank
after tax as a result of the IABF Transactions based on the difference between
the (i) fair value of the IABF at Closing and (ii) book value (which
book value shall not give effect to any fair value adjustments) of the IABF
at Closing which shall be calculated on a basis consistent with the
methodologies and assumptions used to calculate the adjustment to "Total
Equity" reflected in the column "Sales Delinking Transaction" of the Pro
Forma Balance Sheet, which is reflected on the Pro Forma Balance Sheet as the
number set forth on Schedule 3.01(d) (the " _ _Baseline IABF Adjustment__ ").
Such amount calculated at Closing shall be referred to as the "Closing IABF
Adjustment Amount." If the Closing IABF Adjustment Amount is less than the
Baseline IABF Adjustment, the absolute value of the difference shall be a " _
_Negative IABF Final Adjustment Factor__ ". If the Closing IABF Adjustment
Amount is greater than the Baseline IABF Adjustment, then the absolute value
of the difference shall be a " _ _Positive IABF Adjustment Factor__ ". The
parties shall cooperate in good faith prior to Closing to mutually agree on a
calculation of the Closing IABF Adjustment Amount, and in connection therewith
each party shall reasonably cooperate with the other and provide the necessary
information. 

(e) Payment of the Cash Consideration or any other amounts of cash under this
Agreement as set forth on Schedule 3.01(e) shall be in United States Dollars
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated
by the Party (which designation, for any payment due to any Seller, shall be
made by Group) receiving such payment by written Notice to the other Party at
least two Business Days prior to the date on which each payment is due.

3.02 _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, Outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reorganization, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, combination, exchange of
shares, or any similar change in capitalization, then the Share Consideration
shall be appropriately and proportionately adjusted to provide to the Sellers
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
event; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this

 



18  Section 3.02 shall be construed as permitting Purchaser to take any action
or enter into any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

 

3.03 _Deliveries and Actions by Sellers_. At the Closing, Group shall deliver,
or cause to be delivered, to Purchaser the following: 

(a) a stock certificate representing duly issued and validly authorized shares
of capital stock of Bank representing all the issued and Outstanding Equity

(f) (i) Sellers shall provide, and shall cause their Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives to provide, to Purchaser and its Representatives
such historical, financial and other business information regarding the Sales
Package Companies as Purchaser may reasonably request and of a type
customarily provided by Sellers in connection with transactions similar to
the Financing, and to provide reasonable cooperation to Purchaser in
connection with any Financing as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser and
that is customary in connection with transactions similar to the
Financing, including (A) using reasonable efforts to cause to be prepared and
provided to Purchaser such financial information and data and financial
statements of the Sales Package Companies as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any Financing and which may be included in documents filed
with the SEC in connection with such Financing, (B) causing senior executives
of the Sales Package Companies, in each case to the extent reasonably
required, to (x) participate in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions with prospective lenders and
sessions with rating agencies, (y) assist with the preparation of customary
materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, business
projections and similar marketing documents in connection with the Financing
and (z) assist in negotiating the documentation for any Financing, including
reviewing and commenting on documentation and participating in drafting
and negotiating sessions with Purchasers Representatives and (C) using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain officers certificates, legal
opinions, accountants comfort letters and consents to the use of audit
reports and (y) executing and delivering, effective as of no earlier than the
Effective Time, definitive transaction documents, in each case customary for
financings similar to the Financing, _provided_ in each case that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of Sellers or the Sales Package Companies. Purchaser shall, from
time to time, reimburse Sellers for any and all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by Sellers in connection with its compliance with this
Section 6.05(f) (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and
accountants), promptly upon receipt of Sellers written request therefor. For
purposes of this Section 6.05(f), " _ _Financing__ " means any debt, equity
or hybrid financing (including any public offering of securities) undertaken
in connection with or to support the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the
Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing and
reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the Financing
or any alternative financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.01 and 7.02.

(ii) In connection with any Financing, (A) Purchaser will indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Sellers and their Affiliates, directors, officers and
shareholders and each person who controls the Sellers within the meaning of
either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act
(collectively, the " _ _Financing Indemnified Persons__ ") from and against
any and all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith other than any information relating to any Financing Indemnified
Person furnished to Purchaser in writing by or on behalf of the Sellers
or such Financing Indemnified Persons specifically for use in the Financing

 



60  offering documents and (B) Sellers will indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Purchaser and its Affiliates, directors, officers and shareholders and each
person who controls Purchaser within the meaning of either Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Financing Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any and all
Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with any information
furnished to Purchaser in writing by or on behalf of the Sellers or a
Financing Indemnified Person for use in the Financing Offering documents.

 

(iii) The procedures set forth in Section 9.03 shall apply to all
indemnification obligations under this Section 6.05(f).

(iv) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.05(f) is
unavailable or is insufficient in respect of any Losses referred to in this
Section 6.05(f), Purchaser, in lieu of indemnifying such Financing Indemnified
Persons, or Sellers in lieu of indemnifying such Purchaser Financing
Indemnified Persons, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by any
Financing Indemnified Persons or Purchaser Financing Indemnified Persons, as
the case may be, as a result of such Losses (i) in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the parties in connection with
the actions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is
not permitted by applicable Law, in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect not only the relative fault referred to in clause (i) but also the
relative benefit of Purchaser or Seller, on the one hand, and such Financing
Indemnified Persons or Purchaser Indemnified Persons, on the other,
in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses,
as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
the parties will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether
any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has
been taken by, or relates to information supplied by such party, and the
parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such action.

(v) If indemnification is available under this Section 6.05(f)(ii), the
Purchaser shall indemnify each Financing Indemnified Person and Seller shall
indemnify each Purchaser Financing Indemnified Person to the fullest extent
permissible under applicable Law provided in this Section 6.05(f)(ii) without
regard to the relative fault of the parties or any other equitable
considerations provided for in this Section 6.05(f)(iv). The obligations of
Purchaser and Seller under this Section 6.05(f) shall be in addition to any
liability that Purchaser or Seller may otherwise have to any Financing
Indemnified Person or Purchaser Indemnified Person.

6.06 _Confidentiality_. (a) From the date hereof and continuing thereafter,
each Party to this Agreement shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, keep, treat and hold any and all confidential or
proprietary information, knowledge and data of any other Party (such
information, the " _ _Confidential Information__ "), confidential (and not
disclose or provide access to any person), and not to otherwise use any
Confidential Information that becomes known to such Party or its
Representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, except that a Party may disclose
Confidential Information to 

 



61  another person (i) with the prior written consent of Purchaser or Group, as
applicable, (ii) to the extent required by any applicable Law, (iii) during
the course of litigation, so long as the disclosing party uses reasonable
best efforts to provide that the party receiving such information treats the
information in a confidential manner and in accordance with the terms hereof,
(iv) to any taxing authority and (v) to its legal counsel, accountants, banks
and their advisors who need to know such information for the purpose of
assisting the disclosing party in their capacity as such so long as the
disclosing party causes such persons to treat the information in
a confidential manner and in accordance with the terms hereof (it being
understood that the disclosing party shall be responsible for any breach of
the terms of this Section 6.06 by such persons). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that any Party or its Representatives intends to
disclose information pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) above, such Party shall,
or shall cause its Representative to, to the extent reasonably practicable and
permitted by applicable Law, (x) provide Purchaser or Group, as the case may
be, with reasonable written notice of such requirement sufficiently in advance
of disclosing such information so that Purchaser or Group, as applicable, may
seek a protective order or other remedy, (y) in the event that such
protective order or other remedy is not obtained, furnish only that portion of
such Confidential Information which is legally required to be provided and
exercise reasonable best efforts to obtain assurances that confidential
treatment will be afforded to such Confidential Information and (z) use
reasonable best efforts to promptly furnish to Purchaser or Group, as
applicable, a copy (in whatever form or medium) of such Confidential
Information that it intends to furnish or has furnished. The foregoing
sentences in this Section 6.06(a) shall not apply to any information,
knowledge or data that at the time of disclosure is publicly available or
becomes publicly available through no act or omission of the party owing a
duty of confidentiality, or becomes available on a non-confidential basis from
a source other than the party owing a duty of confidentiality, so long as such
source is not known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement
with or other obligations of secrecy to the other Party. On and after the
Closing Date, the obligations under this Section 6.06(a) shall remain in full
force and effect with respect to each Party to this Agreement. 

(b) As of the date hereof, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be terminated,
_provided_ , _however_ , that such termination shall not affect any claims
for breaches thereof that occurred prior to such termination.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a breach of the obligations
under this Section 6.06 by any Party, its Affiliates or any Representatives of
any of the foregoing, the other Party, in addition to all other available
remedies, shall be entitled to specific performance to enforce the provisions
of this Section 6.06 in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with
Section 10.12.

6.07 _Benefit Arrangements_. (a) Sellers shall ensure that as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each employee or other service provider of
Sellers and their Affiliates whose responsibilities consist primarily of
providing services to the businesses of the Sales Package Companies is
employed (or, in the case of independent contractors, engaged) by the Direct
Sale Companies and their Subsidiaries and that no other individual is
employed (or, in the case of independent contractors, engaged) by the Direct
Sale Companies and their Subsidiaries. For the period from and after the
Effective Time until December 31, 2012 (the " _ _Continuation Period__ "),
Purchaser shall provide or cause its Affiliates to provide to each employee of
any of the Direct

 



62  Sale Companies or their respective Subsidiaries who continues employment
with Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (each,
a " _ _Continuing Employee__ "): (i) base wages or salaries, as applicable,
at least equal to those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time; and (ii) an annual cash bonus opportunity that is no
less favorable than the annual cash bonus opportunity provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.07(a) to the contrary, for the
period from and after the Effective Time until December 31, 2012, Purchaser
shall provide or cause its Affiliates to provide to each Continuing Employee
and Retiree employee benefits (for clarity, this Section 6.07(b) relates
solely to employee pension benefit and employee welfare benefit plans and does
not relate to compensatory arrangements or individual agreements) which are,
subject to the final sentence of this Section 6.07(b), the same in all
material respects to the employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements, including Health and Welfare Benefits, provided to the
Continuing Employee or Retiree immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement (collectively, the " _ _Pre-Closing Benefit Arrangements__ "). In
determining whether the benefits provided to the Continuing Employees and
Retirees pursuant to this Section 6.07(b) meet the applicable standard (
_i.e._ , the same in all material respects), dependent coverage shall be
considered. For the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending
on the Effective Time, the Sellers shall not amend, terminate or partially
terminate the Pre-Closing Benefit Arrangements in any manner that adversely
affects such employees except to the minimum extent required to comply with
any applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph, Purchaser may increase employee cost levels to reflect additional
costs of maintenance of the Pre-Closing Benefit Arrangements above the levels
in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , that such changes shall not be
greater in the aggregate than the average of the aggregate annual increases
in employee cost levels for the Pre-Closing Benefit Arrangements during the
three calendar years prior to the year during which the Effective Time occurs.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.07(a) or 6.07(b) to the contrary, if
a Continuing Employee is eligible to receive sabbatical benefits immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the Continuing Employee shall be entitled to
receive such sabbatical benefits following the Effective Time during the five
year post-eligibility period provided pursuant to the terms of the sabbatical
practices as it applied immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. In
addition, if a Continuing Employee would have been eligible to receive
sabbatical benefits if the Closing had not occurred during the Continuation
Period, the Continuing Employee shall be entitled to receive the sabbatical
benefits that would have been provided to the Continuing Employee pursuant to
the terms of the sabbatical practice as it applied immediately prior to the
date of this Agreement. 

(d) For a period of one year after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall provide
or cause its Affiliates to provide to each Continuing Employee severance
compensation and benefits that each such Continuing Employee is eligible to
receive upon a qualifying termination of employment under the terms of the
severance plan listed on Section 6.07(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
(taking into account service with Group and its Affiliates prior to the
Effective Time and service with Purchaser and its Affiliates after the
Effective Time).

 



63 (e) If the Effective Time occurs before December 31, 2011, then Purchaser
agrees that the 2011 annual bonuses under the ING Direct Short-Term Incentive
Plan (the " _ _2011 Bonuses__ ") for Continuing Employees shall be determined
as follows: (i) the portion of the 2011 Bonus to which each participant in
such plan shall be entitled based on services performed in 2011 through the
Effective Time shall be determined on a pro-rata basis immediately prior to
the Effective Time based on the actual performance level taking into account
the financial performance of the Bank in the normal course of business
achieved in 2011 through the Effective Time and (ii) the portion of the 2011
Bonus to which each participant in such plan shall be entitled based on
services performed in 2011 after the Effective Time shall be determined on a
pro-rata basis in accordance with Section 6.07(a)(ii). If the Effective Time
occurs on or after December 31, 2011, but before the 2011 Bonuses are paid,
the amount of the 2011 Bonuses shall be determined immediately prior to the
Effective Time based on the actual performance level taking into account the
financial performance of the Bank in the normal course of business achieved in
2011. In all cases, 2011 Bonuses for Continuing Employees shall be payable at
the same time as annual bonuses for 2011 are paid to employees of Purchaser
and its Subsidiaries generally (but in no event later than March 15, 2012), so
long as the applicable employee remains employed through such date,
provided that an employee terminated subsequent to the Effective Time under
circumstances entitling such employee to severance benefits under Section
6.07(d) shall be entitled to receive a prorated bonus for the portion of the
year served, payable based on actual performance at the time 2011 bonuses are
payable generally. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section
6.07(e), the 2011 Bonuses shall otherwise be determined and payable in
accordance with the terms of the ING Direct Short-Term Incentive Plan.

(f) With respect to any Purchaser Benefit Plans in which any Continuing
Employee becomes eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time,
Purchaser, as applicable, shall (i) with respect to Health and Welfare
Benefits, waive all preexisting conditions, actively at work requirements,
exclusion and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements under the Purchaser Benefit Plans to the extent they were
inapplicable to, or were satisfied under, the US HoldCo Benefit Plans, (ii)
for purposes of (A) eligibility, (B) vesting and (C) benefit level, solely
with respect to any severance or paid time off plans or policies (but not for
purposes of benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) recognize
the service that was credited to each such Continuing Employee under the
corresponding US HoldCo Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time, under the
Purchaser Benefit Plans (except to the extent it would result in a duplication
of benefits or is not provided for employees of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
for the same period of service), as if such service were with Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries and (iii) with respect to Health and Welfare Benefits, cause
any deductible, coinsurance and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents under the US HoldCo
Benefit Plans during the portion of the plan year ending on the Closing Date
to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket requirements under the applicable Purchaser Benefit
Plan (to the same extent as they would be taken into account if incurred under
such Purchaser Benefit Plan).

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser and the Sellers acknowledge and
agree that all provisions contained in this Section 6.07 are included for the
sole benefit of Purchaser and the Sellers and nothing contained herein shall
(i) be construed as an amendment to any US HoldCo Benefit Plan or Purchaser
Benefit Plan, (ii) create any third-party beneficiary or

 



64  other rights in any other person, including any employee or former employee
of any of the Direct Sale Companies or their respective Subsidiaries, any
participant in the US HoldCo Benefit Plans, or any dependent or beneficiary
thereof or (iii) otherwise obligate Purchaser or Group or any of their
Affiliates to maintain any particular US HoldCo Benefit Plan, Purchaser
Benefit Plan or retain the employment of any particular employee of any of
the Direct Sale Companies or their respective Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time.

(h) Prior to the Closing Date, US HoldCo shall take all necessary actions to
assign to Purchaser the US HoldCo Benefit Plans listed on Section 6.07(h) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and Purchaser shall assume such US HoldCo
Benefit Plans listed on Section 6.07(h) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule at
the Effective Time and be responsible for any Liabilities under such plans
following the Effective Time.

(i) The Sellers shall be solely responsible for any Controlled Group
Liabilities.

 

(j) US Holdco or its applicable Affiliate shall take such actions as are
reasonably necessary to provide for termination within the 30-day period
prior to the Effective Time, contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective
Time, of the US Holdco Benefit Plans listed on Section 6.07(j) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, but only to the extent that such terminations can
be effectuated in accordance with Treas. Regs. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B)
(it being understood and agreed, however, that US Holdco or its applicable
Affiliate shall in any case effectuate such termination if requested by
Purchaser subsequent to the date hereof, so long as Purchaser consents to
accelerated vesting prior to such termination of the amounts referenced on
Section 6.07(j) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule) and, in connection with
such terminations, if any, all distributions under the US Holdco Benefit
Plans listed on Section 6.07(j) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule are to be
made to participants in such plans at or prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that to the extent that the termination of such plans and
the related distributions, if any, cannot be effectuated or made prior to or
at the Effective Time in accordance with Treas. Regs. Section
1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), but such terminations and distributions can be
effectuated and made after the Effective Time in accordance with Treas. Regs.
Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), Purchaser or its applicable Affiliate shall (if
in receipt of a legal opinion from the law firm of Kilpatrick Townsend and
Stockton LLP that such actions "will not" trigger income inclusion and
additional tax for any participant under Section 409A of the Code) take such
actions as are reasonably necessary to provide for such terminations and
distributions in accordance with Treas. Regs. Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B).

6.08 _Intellectual Property Matters_.

 

(a) Except as expressly provided in this Section 6.08 or in any Ancillary
Agreement, the Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall include throughout this Section 6.08 the Direct
Sale Companies and their respective Subsidiaries following the Closing),
acknowledges and agrees that neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
is purchasing, acquiring, licensing or otherwise obtaining any right, title or
interest in, to or under any Seller Intellectual Property. As used herein, " _
_Seller Intellectual Property__ " means all Intellectual Property owned or
licensed by the Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers, except for the
Intellectual Property that is a Transferred Asset or that is owned by the
Direct Sale

 



65  Companies and their respective Subsidiaries immediately after Closing,
including (i) the names "ING", "ING Lion", the ING Lion logo, and any Internet
domain name, Trademark, word, name or logo related thereto, or employing the
word "ING", "ING Lion", or the ING Lion logo, or any derivation, variation,
translation or adaptation thereof, or any Internet domain name, Trademark,
word, name or logo confusingly similar thereto or embodying any of the
foregoing, whether alone or in combination with any other Internet domain
names, Trademarks, words, names or logos, and whether registered or
unregistered (collectively, the " _ _Seller Trademarks__ ") and (ii) the
Intellectual Property set forth on Schedule 6.08(a). Without limiting the
foregoing, each of the Direct Sale Companies and their respective Subsidiaries
shall assign any and all rights, title or interest it has in or to any of the
Seller Intellectual Property and the Intellectual Property listed on Section
6.08(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, including any Seller Trademarks,
and transfer any and all tangible embodiments thereof, to a Seller or a
designee specified by a Seller at or prior to the Closing, which assignment
may be made at the discretion of the Sellers by way of a dividend or other
distribution on its Equity Interests or otherwise.

 

(b) Except as expressly provided in this Section 6.08 or in any Ancillary
Agreement, as of and following the Closing, the Purchaser shall, and shall
cause the Direct Sale Companies and their respective Subsidiaries to, cease
and discontinue promptly after the Closing any and all uses of any and all (i)
Seller Intellectual Property other than the Seller Trademarks and (ii) Seller
Trademarks as a trademark, service mark, brand, logo, symbol, design, Internet
domain name, trade name, corporate name, business name, d/b/a or other name or
indicia of source or origin of any product or service. Except as
expressly provided in this Section 6.08 or in any Ancillary Agreement, the
Purchaser, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, agrees, as of and following
the Closing, that neither the Purchaser, nor any of its Affiliates shall have
any right, title or interest in, or any authority or license to use or allow
others to use in any manner whatsoever, any Seller Intellectual Property, and
any such right, title, interest, authority, license or sublicense or other
arrangement relating thereto (whether written or oral) existing prior to the
Closing, shall automatically terminate simultaneously with and effective as of
the Closing. Within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall, and shall cause the Direct Sale Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries to, file before the relevant Governmental Authority the necessary
documents so as to amend or terminate any registration or certificate of
assumed name, fictitious name, d/b/a filings, or other filings containing any
such Seller Trademarks so as to cause such corporate names, Internet domain
names and Trademarks of or used by the Direct Sale Companies or their
respective Subsidiaries to change and eliminate any Seller Trademarks
therefrom. 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing and, except as expressly provided in this
Section 6.08 or in any Ancillary Agreement, and only to the extent that use
of any Materials (as defined below) cannot be commercially reasonably avoided
after the Closing by Direct Sale Companies and their respective Subsidiaries,
the Direct Sale Companies and their respective Subsidiaries shall have the
limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, terminable, royalty-free, non-
exclusive, right only in the United States of America (including its
territories and possessions) to deplete the labeling, stationery, business
forms, supplies, advertising and promotional materials and packaging existing
in the inventory of such Direct Sale Company and its Subsidiaries at the
Closing that bear the Seller Trademarks (the " _ _Materials__ ") for
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, which period of time may be
extended for a period not to exceed four (4) months upon the consent of the
Seller, not to be unreasonably withheld (the " _Transition Period_ "), for
use 

 



66  solely in connection with their respective businesses (the " _ _Materials
License__ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) none of Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates shall take any action that could reasonably be expected to
impair the value of or goodwill associated with the Seller Trademarks, (ii)
the Purchaser shall cause each of the Direct Sale Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries to (A) use the Materials and make any use of the
Seller Trademarks pursuant to this Section 6.08 in accordance with the
branding guidelines set forth on _Schedule 6.08(c)_ , as these may be
reasonably updated or amended from time to time on reasonable prior notice,
(B) when using any of the Materials in the context of entering into or
conducting contractual relationships, make clear to all other applicable
parties that it, rather than the Sellers or any of Sellers Affiliates, is
the party entering into or conducting the contractual relationship, and (C)
cease using the Seller Trademarks on such Materials as soon as practicable and
in any event within the Transition Period. The Sellers may terminate the
Materials License upon written notice in the event of a material breach of
the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 6.08(c) which is not cured
within 10 days of receipt of notice thereof. Any physical Materials remaining
after such Transition Period shall be destroyed by Purchaser, and an
authorized officer of the Purchaser shall certify to the Sellers in writing
that such destruction has taken place, unless, at Sellers option, a Seller
notifies the Purchaser that it wishes such remaining Materials to be
delivered to its or its designees offices. For avoidance of doubt, none of
the Direct Sale Companies or their respective Subsidiaries shall create any
new materials bearing any Seller Trademarks, alter in any way the
Seller Trademarks as they are displayed on the Materials, nor use the
Materials in any manner not consistent with their practice before Closing.

(d) Purchaser, for itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that,
(i) as between the Parties hereto, the Sellers own or have the exclusive right
to use any and all of the Seller Trademarks and except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Section 6.08 or in any Ancillary Agreement, neither the
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall, as of the Closing, have any rights
in or to the Seller Trademarks, (ii) neither the Purchaser nor any of
Purchasers Affiliates shall contest the ownership or validity of any rights
of the Sellers or any of Sellers Affiliates in or to the Seller Trademarks
and (iii) neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall adopt, use,
register or attempt to register in any jurisdiction any of the Seller
Trademarks or instruct others to do so. Purchaser agrees, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, and shall ensure, that any use of the Seller Trademarks
as permitted in this Section 6.08 shall be only with respect to goods and
services of a level of quality equal to or greater than the quality of goods
and services with respect to which the Direct Sale Companies or their
respective Subsidiaries used such Seller Trademarks prior to the Closing.
Purchaser, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that after the Closing,
neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates, will expressly, or willingly
by implication, do business as or represent themselves as the Sellers or any
of Sellers Affiliates, and the personnel of the Purchaser or their Affiliates
shall not, and shall have no authority to, as of the Closing, hold themselves
out as officers, employees or agents of the Sellers. 

(e) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, and subject
to and conditioned upon compliance with the terms and conditions of this
Section 6.08(e) and the Co-existence Agreement referenced in Section 6.08(h)
below, Sellers hereby grant to Bank and its Subsidiaries a limited, non-
exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenable royalty-free license for Bank
and its Subsidiaries to continue using after Closing only during the
Transition Period and only in the United States of America (including its
territories and possessions) the Seller Trademarks in substantially the same
manner that the Bank and its Subsidiaries used the Seller

 



67  Trademarks prior to Closing in the business of accepting deposits (including
payment and savings accounts) from or offering mortgage or other loan products
to individual retail customers with a residence in the United States
(including its territories and possessions) through a website accessible via
the Internet and directed only to retail customers with a residence in the
United States of America (including its territories and possessions), without
any alteration or modification thereof, and solely:

(A) in the corporate names and trade names of Bank and its Subsidiaries, to
the extent and in the manner that Bank or its Subsidiaries used the Seller
Trademarks in such names prior to Closing in the ordinary course of business;
and

 

(B) in the names of, or in connection with, the marketing, sale and issuance
of any products available for sale immediately before Closing that had
incorporated the Seller Trademarks in their product names (" _Existing
Products_ ") to the extent and in the manner that Bank or its Subsidiaries
used such Seller Trademarks in such product names prior to Closing in
the ordinary course of business

in each case of clauses (A) and (B), for a period of time commencing at
Closing and continuing only for the Transition Period (the " _Transitional
License_ "); _provided_ that, (I) during such Transition Period, the Bank and
its Subsidiaries use reasonable best efforts to cease use of the Seller
Trademarks as promptly as practicable; (II) upon expiration of such
Transition Period, Bank and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease all use
of and no longer use the Seller Trademarks, including in connection with its
business or the products referenced above, and (III) Bank and its
Subsidiaries shall not use the Seller Trademarks in connection with any
products or services that were not existing at Closing.

(ii) The Transitional License is subject to the following additional
conditions and limitations: (A) Bank and its Subsidiaries shall not develop
any new types of materials bearing the Seller Trademarks, nor use or display
the Seller Trademarks on any other materials or in any other capacity not
expressly stated in this Section 6.08(e); (B) neither Bank nor its
Subsidiaries may alter or modify the appearance of the Seller Trademarks on
the Existing Products, nor have anyone else do so; (C) all use of the Existing
Products shall be consistent with past practice and Bank and its Subsidiaries
shall only use the Seller Trademarks on Existing Products of at least equal
or higher quality as the Existing Products used by Bank and its Subsidiaries
prior to Closing; (D) none of Bank or its Subsidiaries shall take any action
that could reasonably be expected to impair the value of or goodwill
associated with the Seller Trademarks; (E) the Purchaser shall cause each of
Bank and its Subsidiaries to (1) make any use of the Seller Trademarks
pursuant to this Section 6.08(e) in accordance with the branding guidelines
set forth on _Schedule 6.08(c)_ , as these may be reasonably updated or
amended from time to time on reasonable prior notice, (2) when using any of
the corporate or business names or Existing Products in the context of
entering into or conducting contractual relationships, make clear to all
other applicable parties that it, rather than the Sellers or any of Sellers
Affiliates, is the party entering into or conducting the contractual
relationship and (3) cease using the Seller Trademarks as a corporate name or
business name and on Existing Products upon expiration or termination of the
Transitional License. The Sellers may terminate the Transitional License upon
written notice in the event of a material breach of the terms and
conditions set forth in this Section 6.08(b) which is not cured within 10
days of receipt of notice thereof. Any physical

 



68  Existing Products remaining after the expiration or termination of the
Transitional License shall be destroyed by Purchaser, and an authorized
officer of the Purchaser shall certify to the Sellers in writing that such
destruction has taken place, unless, at Sellers option, a Seller notifies the
Purchaser that it wishes such remaining Existing Products to be delivered to
its or its designees offices. Whenever Bank or any of its Subsidiaries
displays or otherwise uses any of the Seller Trademarks or distributes any
Materials to a person, Bank or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall
include therewith the following statement (or another similar statement if
agreed by Sellers and the Bank) conspicuously so as to reasonably draw
attention to such statement: "INGDirect Bank has been acquired by Capital One
Financial Corp. and is no longer affiliated with ING Groep N.V. ("ING"). The
[to refer to specific Marks(s) included in Materials at issue] are trademarks
of ING and are used by permission."

(iii) Sellers shall have the right during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice to Purchaser and in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to
Banks or its Subsidiaries properties or business operations, to inspect for
compliance with this Section 6.08 and any and all uses of the Seller
Trademarks by Bank and its Subsidiaries, including inspection of any and all
materials on which the Seller Trademarks are displayed in the possession or
control of Bank and its Subsidiaries. Any noncompliance with this Section
6.08 shall be corrected promptly upon written notification thereof by Sellers.

(f) To the extent that any of the Intellectual Property owned by the Direct
Sale Companies or their respective Subsidiaries immediately after Closing was
used by any Seller or any Affiliate of a Seller (each, a " _ _Licensee__ ") or
a Licensee otherwise had a right to or benefit under such Intellectual
Property before Closing, Purchaser hereby grants to each such Licensee a non-
exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, non-terminable, worldwide, fully paid-up,
royalty-free right and license in, to and under such Intellectual Property
(with the right to sublicense to Affiliates and to its and their respective
contractors, consultants and customers in connection with the business of such
Licensee or Affiliate), including the right (i) under such Intellectual
Property to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, lease, sell and
otherwise transfer or dispose of any products or services for any purpose, and
to practice any process or any method for any purpose, and (ii) to use,
reproduce, display (publicly or otherwise), perform, transmit, distribute,
modify, prepare derivative works of and otherwise exploit such Intellectual
Property and any tangible embodiment thereof for any purpose; provided
that for the avoidance of doubt such license shall be subject to the Co-
existence Agreement entered into pursuant to Section 6.08(h).

(g) The Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that on or before the Closing, Group
or its designee will transfer and migrate (which transfer and migration may be
made at the discretion of the Sellers by way of a dividend or other
distribution on its Equity Interests or otherwise) to any devices or media at
a location or locations designated by Group or its designee all copies and
versions of (i) any Software owned by the Sellers or any of its Affiliates
(other than Direct Sale Companies and their respective Subsidiaries) that
reside on any of the Sales Package Companies servers, computers, equipment or
storage media and (ii) any Assigned Software. The Sellers and Purchaser agree
that, on or prior to the Closing, the Sellers and Purchaser shall enter into
an agreement whereby Sellers shall grant a non-exclusive, perpetual,
irrevocable (except for violation of the territorial, assignment or
sublicensing restrictions), non-transferable and non-assignable (except in
the context of a sale of substantially all of the assets of

 



69  Purchaser and its affiliates that comprise businesses using such Software),
non-terminable (except upon written notice for material violation of the
territorial, assignment or sublicensing restrictions which is not cured
within 10 days of receipt of notice), non-sublicensable (except to controlled
Affiliates as long as such sublicense is subject to and conditioned on all of
the terms and conditions of such license, and extends to such sublicensee
only so long as such sublicensee is a controlled Affiliate, with no right to
further sublicense), fully paid-up, royalty-free right and license to the
Direct Sale Companies to use the Software set forth on Schedule 6.08(g)(i) and
the patents set forth on Schedule 6.08(g)(ii) solely for their own internal
use for Bank Products (as such term is defined in Exhibit E) in Online Retail
Banking (as such term is defined in Exhibit E) and the servicing thereof, and
the brokerage business included in the Sales Package Companies) solely within
the United States (the " _ _License Agreement__ "). The parties agree to use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate (i) in transitioning the Software, as
applicable, that is used in the conduct of the business of the Sales Package
Companies under agreements of such third parties with Sellers or their
Affiliates (other than the Direct Sale Companies) to Purchaser and its
Affiliates under agreements of such third parties with Purchaser and its
Affiliates at and following the Closing and (ii) if no agreement of such third
party with Purchaser or its Affiliates exists or is entered into by Purchaser
or its Affiliates prior to the Closing, to obtain any required Consents for
Software licensed by Seller and its Affiliates and used in the business of the
Sales Package Companies that Purchaser desires to use following the Closing;
provided that Seller or any Affiliate of Seller shall not be required to
incur any cost or expense to such third party in connection with the foregoing
subsections (i) and (ii), or for any consents.

(h) Promptly following the date hereof in no event later than the Closing, the
parties shall negotiate reasonably and in good faith agree upon a form of Co-
existence Agreement consistent in all material respects with the terms and
conditions set forth in Exhibit E hereto.

6.09 _Services Provided by Group to the Direct Sale Companies_. Unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by Group or as contemplated in the Transition
Services Agreement, (a) all services provided by Group or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Direct Sale Companies or their
respective Subsidiaries) to the Direct Sale Companies or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, (b) all services provided to Group or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Direct Sale Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries) by the Direct Sale Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries and (c) all agreements between Group or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Direct Sale Companies or their respective Subsidiaries) on the
one hand, and any of the Direct Sale Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries on the other, in each case shall be terminated as of the
Effective Time, other than those agreements set forth on _Schedule 6.09_,
without payment or incurrence of further liability or obligation (contingent
or otherwise) thereunder and Group will deliver to Purchaser evidence of the
termination of such agreements, which evidence shall be reasonably acceptable
to Purchaser. Promptly following the date hereof, the parties shall
negotiate reasonably and in good faith agree upon (in no event later than the
Closing) a transition services agreement in a form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers (the " _ _Transition Services Agreement__
"). 

 



70 6.10 _Fees and Expenses_. (a) Except as expressly provided below or in
the Ancillary Agreements, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements, including
the fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants,
shall be paid by the person incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not
such transactions are consummated.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if this
Agreement is terminated by (i) Purchaser or Group pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(ii); (ii) Purchaser or Group pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii); or
(iii) by Group pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) as a result, in whole or in
part, of a breach by Purchaser of Section 5.03(f), 5.03(g) or Section 6.02
(but only to the extent the written notice of breach contemplated by Section
8.01(b)(i) specifically cited the breaches of Section 5.03(f), 5.03(g) or
Section 6.02, as applicable, and such breaches were not cured during the cure
period referenced therein) and, in the case of any such termination, at the
time of such termination the Relevant Regulatory Approvals have not been
obtained; then, in each case, Purchaser shall, without prejudice to any other
rights that Group may have against Purchaser for a breach of this Agreement or
otherwise under any theory of recovery, pay to Group a fee in an amount equal
to $270,000,000 (such amount, the " _ _Termination Fee__ ") by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account specified pursuant to Section
3.01(d) promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days after such
termination if by Group or concurrently with such termination if by Purchaser;
_provided_ that Purchaser shall have no obligation to pay such Termination Fee
if (i) any Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition shall have occurred,
(ii) Sellers shall have materially breached Section 6.02, 5.02(f) or 5.02(g)
or (iii) if the proximate cause of any denial or failure to obtain any such
Relevant Regulatory Approval, is (A) any regulatory issue or event relating
to Sellers, the Sales Package Companies or any of their Affiliates which was
not Previously Disclosed, or (B) any capital or other regulatory issues
arising out of or related to the IABF Transactions, or the failure
to complete the IABF Transactions (each of (i) through (iii), a " _ _Seller
Regulatory Matter__ "). For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will Purchaser
be obligated to pay more than one Termination Fee.

 

(c) Purchaser and the Sellers acknowledge that the agreements contained in
Section 6.10(b) are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without
these agreements Group would not have entered into this Agreement;
accordingly, if Purchaser fails to promptly pay when due the amounts due
pursuant to Section 6.10(b), and, in order to obtain such payment Group
commences a suit which results in a judgment against Purchaser, for any of
the amounts set forth in this Section 6.10, all costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by Group in connection with such suit shall be
reimbursed by the Purchaser promptly upon demand, together with interest on
the amounts due pursuant to Section 6.10(b) at the prime rate of interest as
reported in the Wall Street Journal from the date such amounts were required
to be paid until the date actually received by Group.

6.11 _No Solicitation_. (a) Until the earlier of the consummation of the
Transactions and the second anniversary of the termination date (in the event
that this Agreement is terminated for any reason pursuant to Article VIII),
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall not, directly or indirectly, hire or
solicit any employee of any Sales Package Company regarding the employment of
such person or the provision of other services by such person; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that this Section 6.11(a) shall not (i) apply to any person who
has ceased to be employed by any

 



71  Sales Package Company for a period of at least six months prior to
commencement of employment discussions between Purchaser and such person or
(ii) prohibit general solicitations for employment through advertisements,
professional recruiters or other means not targeted at such individuals.

(b) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the second
anniversary thereof, the Sellers and their Affiliates shall not, directly or
indirectly, hire or solicit any employee of any Sales Package Company
regarding the employment of such person or the provision of other services by
such person; _provided_ , _however_ , that this Section 6.11(b) shall not (i)
apply to any person who has ceased to be employed by any Sales Package Company
for a period of at least six months prior to commencement of employment
discussions between Sellers and such person or (ii) prohibit general
solicitations for employment through advertisements, professional recruiters
or other means not targeted at such individuals.

ancillary thereto (and, for the avoidance of doubt, not as a core or primary
product offering in the customer relationships of the non-Sales Package
Companies) as of the date hereof, including deposits taken solely in
connection with wealth management, asset management and brokerage activities,

which such closing occurs, measured on an annualized basis relative to the
preceding calendar year), the total deposits of the Seller Competing Business
in each such calendar year will not exceed 110% of the total deposits of such
Seller Competing Business in the immediately preceding calendar year;

reasonable terms as soon as reasonably practicable following the acquisition
of such ownership or interest; or

(viii) any Seller or any of its Affiliates from acquiring any equity
securities of any person that has outstanding Indebtedness to a Seller or any
of its Affiliates, or engaging in any activities otherwise prohibited by this
Section 6.12 in connection with any such person as a result of the

of this Section 6.12 in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with
Section 10.12.

acquires, any rights in or to use any Reserved Marks (as defined in Exhibit
E) (a "Covered Affiliate") shall either enter into a co-existence agreement
substantially identical to the co-existence agreement executed by Sellers
and/or their Affiliates at the Closing or continue to be bound by this
Section 6.12 without regard to the exclusion provided in this paragraph (e);
_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall take such actions as

efforts to resolve any such disagreement and, if they are unable to resolve
such disagreement, to cause an independent accounting firm (the " _
_Accounting Firm__ ") to resolve such disagreement at least 5 days prior to
the due date therefor (taking into account any available extensions), and any

Sellers. The preparation and filing of any Tax Return for a taxable period of
any Direct Sale Company or any of its Subsidiaries that begins after the
Closing Date shall be exclusively within the control of Purchaser.

 

(iii) Purchaser shall cause the Direct Sale Companies to promptly (and in any
event within 120 days after the Closing Date) furnish information to the
Sellers as reasonably requested by the Sellers to allow the Sellers to satisfy
their obligations under clause (i), which information shall be completed in a
manner consistent with past practice as to providing such information and as
to the method of computation of separate taxable income or other relevant
measure of income of the Direct Sale Companies (and their Subsidiaries).

(c) _Tax Contests_.

(i) Sellers shall have the exclusive right to control, at their own expense,
any Tax Proceeding in respect of any Direct Sale Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date;
_provided_ , that, after the Closing, the Sellers shall allow the Direct Sale
Companies and their counsel

 



78  to participate at their sole expense in any such Tax Proceeding and any Tax
Proceeding with respect to US HoldCos consolidated federal income Tax Returns
or consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns to the extent that such
returns relate to the Direct Sale Companies (or their Subsidiaries).

 

(ii) Sellers shall not settle any Tax Proceeding described in clause (i) to
the extent that such Tax Proceeding relates to the Direct Sale Companies (or
their Subsidiaries) in a manner that would adversely affect Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates (including the Direct Sale Companies (or their Subsidiaries)
for any Post-Closing Tax Period) without the prior written consent of
Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed and shall not be necessary to the extent the Sellers indemnify
Purchaser against the effects of any such settlement).

 

(iii) In the case of a Tax Proceeding for a Straddle Period of a Direct Sale
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any consolidated, combined or unitary
group that consists solely of Direct Sale Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries), (A) if such Tax Proceeding can be separated into separate
proceedings for the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period,
the provisions of Sections 6.15(c)(i) and (ii) shall apply, _mutatis mutandis_
, with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Purchaser shall have the
exclusive right to control, at its own expense, the Tax Proceeding
with respect to the Post-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ , that Purchaser
shall not settle any such Tax Proceeding in a manner that would adversely
affect the Sellers or any of their Affiliates without the prior written
consent of Sellers (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed and shall not be necessary to the extent that Purchaser
indemnifies Sellers against the effects of any such settlement); and (B) if
such Tax Proceeding cannot be separated into separate proceedings for the
Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period, the following rules
shall apply: If the claim for Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period
exceeds or reasonably could be expected to exceed in amount the claim for
Taxes attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period, US HoldCo, or otherwise
Purchaser (US HoldCo or Purchaser, as the case may be, the " _ _Tax
Controlling Party__ "), shall be entitled to control such Tax Proceeding.
In such case, the other party (the " _ _Tax Non-Controlling Party__ ") shall
be entitled to participate fully (at the Tax Non-Controlling Partys sole
expense) in the conduct of such Tax Proceeding and the Tax Controlling
Party shall not settle any such Tax Proceeding without the prior written
consent of the Tax Non-Controlling Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event of any
disagreement between the Tax Controlling Party and the Tax Non-Controlling
Party regarding the settlement of any such Tax Proceeding, the Tax Controlling
Party and the Tax Non-Controlling Party shall cause the Accounting Firm to
resolve any such disagreement and any such resolution shall be final and
binding upon the Parties. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall
be borne equally by the Tax Controlling Party and the Tax Non-Controlling
Party. The Tax Controlling Party shall consult with the Tax Non-Controlling
Party with respect to all significant actions in such Tax Proceeding and
shall defend such action diligently and in good faith as if it were the only
party in interest with respect to such Tax Proceeding.

 



79 (iv) Purchaser shall have the exclusive right to control, at its own expense,
any Tax Proceeding in respect of any Direct Sale Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (or any consolidated, combined or unitary group that consists
solely of the Direct Sale Companies and their respective Subsidiaries) other
than any Tax Proceeding described in Sections 6.15(c)(i), (ii) and (iii).

(d) _Post-Closing Obligations of Purchaser_. 

(i) Without the prior written consent of Group (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Purchaser shall not, and
shall not cause or permit any of the Direct Sale Companies (and their
Subsidiaries) to (A) amend any Tax Return filed with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or (B) make any Tax election that would have retroactive
effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(ii) At Groups request, Purchaser shall cause the Direct Sale Companies (and
their Subsidiaries) to make, or join with US HoldCo in making, any Tax
election if the making of such election does not have an adverse impact on
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

 

(e) _Payments and Refunds_.

(i) Payments due to a Purchaser Tax Indemnitee or a Seller Tax Indemnitee
under this Section 6.15 shall be made within 5 Business Days following written
notice by the indemnified party that payment of such amounts to the
appropriate taxing authority or other applicable third party is or was due by
the indemnified party; provided, that the indemnifying party shall not be
required to make any payment earlier than 5 Business Days before it is due to
the appropriate taxing authority or applicable third party.

(ii) Sellers shall be entitled to any refunds or credits received by, or
elected to be applied against Taxes of, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Direct Sale Companies and their
Subsidiaries) of (A) Excluded Taxes, to the extent Sellers have paid
or caused to be paid such Taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and (B)
Taxes, to the extent Sellers have indemnified the Purchaser Tax Indemnitees
for such Taxes; _provided_ , that, subject to Section 6.15(e)(iii), Purchaser
shall be entitled to (x) any refunds or credits of Taxes to the extent that
such refunds or credits result from a carryback of a Tax attribute of any
Direct Sale Company arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period. Any refunds
or credits of or against Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Direct Sale
Companies or their Subsidiaries for any Straddle Period shall be equitably
apportioned between Sellers and Purchaser in accordance with the principles
set forth in Section 6.15(a)(iii). Except as otherwise provided above in this
Section 6.15(e)(ii), Purchaser shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of
or against Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Direct Sale Companies or
their Subsidiaries. Each party shall pay, or cause its Affiliates to pay, to
the party entitled pursuant to this Section 6.15(e)(ii) to a refund or credit
of Taxes, the amount of such refund or credit in readily available funds
within ten (10) days of the actual receipt of the refund or credit in readily
available funds or the application of such refund or credit against amounts
otherwise

 



80  payable, in each case net of any reasonable costs (including Taxes) to the
party receiving such refund or credit.

 

(iii) Except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law, Purchaser shall cause
the Direct Sale Companies and their respective Subsidiaries to elect to carry
forward any item of loss, deduction or credit that arises in any Post-Closing
Tax Period.

(f) _Mutual Assistance and Cooperation_. After the Closing, the Sellers and
Purchaser shall, subject to Section 6.05 and Section 6.06:

request with respect to US HoldCo or its Subsidiaries for Taxes for which the

_Transfer Taxes__ ") incurred as a result of the transfers effected pursuant
to this Agreement. Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate in the preparation
and filing of any Tax Returns required to be filed with respect to any
Transfer Taxes.

(h)  _Tax Sharing Agreements_. As of the Closing Date, any tax sharing or
allocation agreement or arrangement, whether or not written, that may have

their Subsidiaries) shall be terminated, and no payments which are owed by or
to the Direct Sale Companies (and their Subsidiaries) pursuant thereto shall
be made.

(i) _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The Sellers shall prepare a draft
allocation of the Purchase Price (and all other capitalized costs) among the
Shares and the Transferred Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of state,
local or foreign Law) (the " _ _Sellers Draft Allocation__ "). The Sellers
shall deliver the Sellers Draft Allocation to Purchaser within 90 days after
the date hereof (and in all events, prior to the Closing Date). Purchaser
shall have the right to review the Sellers

 



81  Draft Allocation and, to the extent Purchaser disagrees with the Sellers
Draft Allocation, Purchaser shall notify Sellers in writing of any objections
within 15 days after receipt of the Sellers Draft Allocation (and in all
events, prior to the Closing Date). Sellers and Purchaser shall use their
reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts,
if any. If Sellers and Purchaser are unable to reach an agreement regarding
the Sellers Draft Allocation, then within 15 days following receipt by Sellers
of Purchasers objections (and in all events, prior to the Closing Date), any
disagreement shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm. Any
allocation determined pursuant to the decision of the Accounting Firm shall
be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign

Purchaser has been given, as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between the
Parties or as determined by the Accounting Firm (the " _ _Final Allocation__
") shall be final and binding on all Parties. Purchaser shall timely and
properly prepare, execute, deliver and file all such documents, forms and
other information as the Sellers may reasonably request in preparing such
allocation. The Sellers and Purchaser and their Affiliates shall file all Tax
Returns (including, without limitation, IRS Form 8594) in all respects
consistently with such Final Allocation prepared by the Sellers. Neither the
Sellers nor Purchaser shall take any position (whether for Tax Returns, audits
or otherwise) that is inconsistent with such Final Allocation unless required
to do so by applicable Law.

(j) _FIRPTA Certificate_. At the Closing, Sellers shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to Purchaser (A) if the US HoldCo Liquidation has not occurred, a

or (B) if the US HoldCo Liquidation has occurred, a duly executed certificate,
issued in accordance with Treasury Regulations Sections 1.897-2(h) and

election to reattribute to US HoldCo or any of its Affiliates any Tax
attributes of the Bank or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(B) or (C) and (ii) make an election
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36(d)(6)(i)(A), in form and in
substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, to reduce all or a portion of
US HoldCos basis in the stock of Bank if and to the extent that the failure
to make such an election would result in attribute reduction pursuant to
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36. US HoldCo shall deliver to Purchaser
in a timely manner a copy of any election described in this Section 6.15(k),
together with any relevant attachments, worksheets and calculations prepared

under this Section 6.15.

6.16 _Indemnification; Exculpation; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a)
All rights to indemnification for and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing now existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers of any Direct Sale Company, any of
their respective Subsidiaries, or any of their respective predecessor

 



82  entities, or those individuals who become prior to the Closing a director or
officer of any Direct Sale Company or any of their Subsidiaries (each a " _
_Direct Sale Indemnified Director__ " or a " _ _Direct Sale Indemnified
Officer__ ") as provided in the Governing Documents of each such entity, or in
any indemnification agreement between such Direct Sale Indemnified Director or
Direct Sale Indemnified Officer and such entity (in each case, as in effect
on the date of this Agreement and that have been Previously Disclosed on
Section 6.16 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule), shall survive the Closing
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms for a period of six (6) years from the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action
asserted or made prior to the Closing or within such six-year period shall
continue until the final disposition of such Action.

(b) From and after the Closing until the sixth anniversary thereof, the
Governing Documents of each Direct Sale Company and their respective
Subsidiaries shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of individuals who
were directors or officers prior to the Closing of any Direct Sale Company,
any of their respective Subsidiaries, or any of their respective predecessor
entities, than are presently set forth in such Governing Documents,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals.

(c) (i) From and after the Closing, in the event of any pending, threatened or
actual Action in which any Direct Sale Indemnified Director or Direct Sale
Indemnified Officer is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole
or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to the
fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of such entity, the
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless, or shall cause to be indemnified
and held harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each such
Direct Sale Indemnified Director or Direct Sale Indemnified Officer against
any Losses paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or
actual Action.

(ii) If any Direct Sale Indemnified Director or Direct Sale Indemnified
Officer becomes involved in any pending, threatened or actual Action with
respect to which such Direct Sale Indemnified Director or Direct Sale
Indemnified Officer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section
6.16, the Purchaser, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, shall advance,
or shall cause to be advanced, such Direct Sale Indemnified Director or Direct
Sale Indemnified Officers legal expenses incurred in the defense of any such
Action within ten Business Days of receipt by the Purchaser of a request
therefor; _provided_ , _however_ , that such Direct Sale Indemnified Director
or Direct Sale Indemnified Officer, as the case may be, shall provide an
undertaking to repay such advancement if it is ultimately determined that he
or she is not entitled to be indemnified hereunder.

(iii) The Purchaser shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all expenses,
including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Direct Sale

indemnification in respect of any Action asserted or made prior to
the Closing Date or within such six-year period shall continue until the
final disposition of such Action.

(d) For a period of not less than six (6) years after the Closing, Purchaser
shall or shall cause the Direct Sale Companies to continuously maintain in
effect, at its own expense, directors and officers liability and fidelity
liability insurance, covering each Direct Sale Indemnified Officer and Direct
Sale Indemnified Director for acts and omissions in their capacity as such
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date (including with respect to the
Transactions) on terms, including with respect to coverage and insurance
limits (with no retention), with an insurer or insurers that have at the time
such coverage is written the same or higher A.M. Best rating as the current
primary insurer, no less favorable to such directors and officers in any
material respect than those of the insurance policies providing such coverage
in effect on the date of this Agreement (complete and correct copies of which
have been made available to Purchaser prior to the date hereof);  _provided_
, _however_ , that in complying with its obligations pursuant to this Section
6.16(d), Purchaser shall not be required to expend annually in the aggregate
an amount in excess of the amount set forth on Section 6.16 of Purchasers
Disclosure Schedule (the " _ _Purchaser Premium Cap__ ") and if Purchaser
cannot obtain such insurance coverage without paying in excess of the
Purchaser Premium Cap, Purchaser shall purchase such insurance with
the maximum coverage available for the Purchaser Premium Cap; _provided_ ,
_further_ , this Section 6.16(d) shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
Purchaser elects to obtain prepaid policies ( _i.e._ , "tail coverage")
which in the aggregate provide such directors and officers with the coverage
described in this Section 6.16(d) for an aggregate period of not less than six
(6) years following the Closing with respect to claims arising from acts or
omissions that occurred at or before the Closing Date; _provided_ , _further_
, that if the premium for such "tail coverage" exceeds the Purchaser Premium
Cap, then Purchaser may direct the Direct Sale Companies to obtain
"tail coverage" with the maximum coverage available for the Purchaser Premium
Cap applied over the term of such policy. Purchaser shall deliver copies of
the policy or policies, or "tail coverage" endorsements, that comply with
this paragraph, to Robert Ledig at Closing. In the event Purchaser does not
maintain insurance that complies with this Section 6.16(d) for six (6) years
after the Closing, such Direct Sale Indemnified Director or Direct Sale
Indemnified Officer shall retain all of his or her rights and remedies at
Law, or in equity, including the right to recover reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses incurred to remedy Purchasers breach, as third-party
beneficiaries under this Agreement.

Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties and other assets to
any person, then, and in each such case, the Purchaser or such Direct Sale
Company, as applicable, shall cause proper provision to be made so that such
successors and assigns shall expressly assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.16.

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.16 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each Direct Sale Indemnified Director and Direct
Sale Indemnified

 



84  Officer, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and are in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such person may have from any Direct Sale Company, any
of their Subsidiaries or any other person by contract or otherwise except as
expressly provided herein.

6.17 _Release of Guarantees_. Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with the
Sellers prior to the Closing Date in Sellers efforts to terminate as of the
Effective Time, on terms reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, such guarantees
or commitments by the Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Direct Sale
Companies and their Subsidiaries) of specified obligations of one or more of
the Direct Sale Companies and/or their Subsidiaries under the agreements set
forth on Section 6.17 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to which one or more
of the Direct Sale Companies and/or their Subsidiaries are parties (the " _
_Seller Performance Guarantees__ "), including if requested by the relevant
beneficiary of such Seller Performance Guarantee following discussions between
such beneficiary and Purchaser, by offering guarantees, support or other
security arrangements reasonably acceptable to the relevant beneficiary of
such Seller Performance Guarantee (including bank or other third-party
guarantees, letters of credit or insurance) or taking such other actions as
Purchaser and such beneficiary may mutually agree on. Purchaser shall not take
any action to cause any Seller Performance Guarantees (and, so long as any
Seller Performance Guarantee remains in effect, obligations thereunder) to be
renewed, extended, expanded or amended after the Effective Time. If any Seller
Performance Guarantees are not terminated as of the Effective Time (the " _
_Continuing Seller Performance Guarantees__ "), Purchaser shall: (a) use its
reasonable best efforts to procure that the Continuing Seller Performance
Guarantees be terminated as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
on terms reasonably acceptable to Purchaser; (b) defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Sellers against and from, and reimburse the Sellers for any
losses incurred by the Sellers to the extent relating to or arising under the
Continuing Seller Performance Guarantees following the Closing and (c) procure
that such documents, as are reasonably requested by the Sellers, be executed
by Purchaser to further evidence the obligations set forth in clauses "(a)"
and "(b)" of this sentence.

6.18 _Illiquid Assets Back-Up Facility_. (a) Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and subject to the satisfaction of the condition that all
Requisite Regulatory Approvals shall have been obtained and shall remain in
full force and effect and all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof
shall have expired, Sellers shall effect the IABF Transactions substantially
in accordance with the terms of the IABF Restructuring Arrangements (without
the waiver, amendment or modification of any material term that would
be adverse to Purchaser or its Affiliates or the Sales Package Companies
following the Closing without the prior written consent of Purchaser) and
Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser evidence reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser of such consummation. 

(b) If the IABF Transactions cannot be consummated due to a failure to receive
any of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals that are related to the IABF
Transactions without the imposition of a Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition, if Purchaser in its sole discretion elects in writing, Seller shall
cooperate with Purchaser and use its reasonable best efforts to identify and
enter into an arrangement that is mutually acceptable to Sellers and Purchaser
pursuant to which Sellers shall immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
subject to the satisfaction of the condition that all Requisite Regulatory
Approvals shall have been obtained and shall remain in full force and effect
and all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof shall

 



85  have expired, consummate an alternative restructuring of the IABF (an " _
_Alternative IABF Restructuring__ ") substantially in accordance with the
agreed terms (without the waiver, amendment or modification of any material
term that would be adverse to Purchaser or its Affiliates or the Sales Package
Companies following the Closing without the prior written consent of
Purchaser), and Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Purchaser of such consummation. If any Alternative IABF
Restructuring is consummated, Sellers shall pay to Purchaser a regulatory
consent failure fee equal to the amount of the Termination Fee.

 

6.19 _No Solicitation of Alternative Transactions_. (a) Prior to the Closing
Date, or until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms,
Sellers shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates and Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, solicit or initiate discussions or engage in
negotiations with, or provide information (other than publicly
available information) to, or authorize any financial advisor or other person
to solicit or initiate discussions or engage in negotiations with, or provide
information to, any person (other than Purchaser or its Representatives)
concerning any potential sale of capital stock of, or merger, consolidation,
combination, sale of assets, reorganization or other similar transaction
involving the Sales Package Companies.

(b) Sellers shall and shall cause their Affiliates and Representatives to
immediately terminate any existing discussions or negotiations with any
persons (other than Purchaser) conducted heretofore with respect to any of
the potential transactions described in Section 6.19(a), and promptly
following the date hereof shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all
persons other than Purchaser who have been furnished confidential
information regarding the Sales Package Companies in connection with the
solicitation of or discussions regarding any of the transactions described in
_Section 6.19(a)_ within the 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly to
return or destroy such information. Sellers agree not to, and to cause their
Affiliates and Representatives not to, release any third party from the
confidentiality, standstill, employee non-solicit or other provisions of any
agreement with respect to the transactions described in Section 6.19(a) (" _
_Bidder Agreements__ ") and shall immediately take all steps necessary to
terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given under any such
provisions authorizing any person to engage in any transaction described in
Section 6.19(a). Following the Closing Date, Sellers shall and shall cause
their Affiliates to cooperate with Purchaser, upon Purchasers reasonable
request, to enforce Sellers and Purchasers rights under the Bidder
Agreements to the extent related to the Sales Package Companies. Sellers agree
not to, and shall cause their Affiliates and Representatives not to, take any
action to exempt any person (other than Purchaser) or any action taken by any
person from any Takeover Laws that would otherwise apply in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

pursuant to Section 6.16 who is or was employed or retained primarily by
Sellers or an Affiliate of Sellers (other than the Direct Sale Companies or
any of their Subsidiaries or respective predecessor entities) and not
primarily employed or retained by the Direct Sale Companies or their
Subsidiaries or respective predecessor entities.

(b) Subject to Sections 9.01 and 9.04, from and after the Closing, Purchaser
hereby agrees to indemnify and hold Sellers and their directors, officers,
employees, stockholders, agents, attorneys, representatives, successors and
assigns (collectively, the " _ _Seller Indemnified Parties__ ") harmless from
and against:

(i) any and all Losses suffered or incurred by them relating to or arising out

9.03 _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) If any Action shall be instituted or any claim or demand shall be
asserted by any person or any other matter shall arise in respect of which
payment may be sought under

 



91  Section 9.02 hereof (regardless of the limitations set forth in Section
9.04) (" _ _Indemnification Claim__ "), the indemnified party shall promptly
cause written notice of the assertion of any Indemnification Claim of which
it has knowledge which is reasonably expected to be covered by this indemnity
to be forwarded to the indemnifying party. The indemnifying party shall have
the right, at its sole expense, to assume the defense of any Action or other
claim or demand brought by an unaffiliated third party (a " _ _Third Party
Claim__ ") with counsel of its choice, which must be reasonably satisfactory
to the indemnified party, and to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Indemnification Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified against hereunder; _provided_ , that the indemnifying party shall
have acknowledged in writing to the indemnified party its unqualified
obligation to indemnify the indemnified party as provided hereunder (other
than any qualification arising under the limitations of Section 9.04). If the
indemnifying party elects to defend against, negotiate, settle or
otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any Losses
indemnified by it hereunder, it shall as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within fifteen (15) days (or sooner, if the nature of the
Indemnification Claim so requires)) following notice in accordance with the
first sentence of this Section 9.03 notify the indemnified party of its intent
to do so. If the indemnifying party elects not to defend against, negotiate,
settle or otherwise deal with any Third Party Claim which relates to any
Losses subject to indemnification hereunder, fails to notify the indemnified
party of its election as herein provided, contests its obligations to
indemnify the indemnified party for such Losses under this Agreement
(other than as set forth in the parenthetical to the proviso in the second
sentence of this Section 9.03) the indemnified party may defend against,
negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with such Third Party Claim, _provided_
that the indemnified party shall keep the indemnifying party reasonably
apprised of the status of such Third Party Claim and use reasonable efforts to
allow the indemnifying party to participate therein at its own expense. If the
indemnified party defends any Third Party Claim in accordance with the
foregoing, then the indemnifying party shall reimburse the indemnified party
for the reasonable and out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable and out-
of-pocket attorneys and other professionals fees and disbursements
(collectively, " _ _Expenses__ ") of defending such Third Party Claim upon
submission of periodic bills. If the indemnifying party shall assume the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party may participate at
his or its own expense, in the defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in
any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying
party if (i) so requested by the indemnifying party to participate or (ii)
counsel to the indemnified party shall have advised the indemnified party that
a conflict or potential conflict exists between the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party that would make such separate representation advisable,
(iii) the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties)
include both such indemnified party and the indemnifying party and such
indemnified party shall have been advised in writing by counsel that there
may be one or more legal defenses available to the indemnified party that are
different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party or
(iv) the amount of the monetary recovery is reasonably expected to exceed the
amount the indemnifying party is otherwise obligated to provide
indemnification for under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
indemnifying party shall not be required to pay for more than one such
counsel (plus local counsel) for all indemnified parties in connection with
any Third Party Claim. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each
other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such
Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.03 to the
contrary, neither the indemnifying party nor the indemnified

 



92  party shall, without the written consent of the other party, settle or
compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a default or consent to entry of
any judgment unless the claimant and such party provide to such other party
an unqualified release from all liability in respect of the Third Party Claim
and such settlement, compromise or judgment does not involve any non-monetary
penalty or admission of fault or liability on the part of the indemnified
party or its Affiliates. If the indemnifying party makes any payment on any
Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall be subrogated, to the extent
of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the indemnified party to
any insurance benefits or other claims of the indemnified party with respect
to such Third Party Claim.

(b) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction finding that the indemnifying
party is liable to the indemnified party for Losses hereunder, or the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have arrived at a mutually
binding settlement or other agreement with respect to an Indemnification Claim
hereunder, the indemnifying party shall be required to pay all of the sums so
due and owing to the indemnified party by wire transfer of immediately
available funds within five (5) Business Days after the date of such notice.

(c) The failure of the indemnified party to give reasonably prompt notice of
any Indemnification Claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the
indemnifying partys obligations with respect thereto except to the extent
that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure.

9.04 _Limitations on Indemnification_. (a) An indemnifying party shall not
have any liability under Section 9.02(a)(i) or Section 9.02(b)(i) hereof
(other than with respect to a result of a breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 5.02(a), 5.02(b), 5.02(c), 5.02(e),
5.02(j), 5.02(p)(viii), 5.02(p)(ix), 5.02(p)(xv), 5.02(jj), 5.03(a), 5.03(b),
5.03(c), 5.03(e) or 5.03(j)) unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses
to the indemnified parties finally determined to arise thereunder exceeds
$45,000,000, in which case the indemnifying party(ies) shall be responsible
for Losses to the extent they exceed such amount.

(b) None of the Sellers shall be required to indemnify any person under
Section 9.02(a)(i) for an aggregate amount of Losses exceeding $500 million
(the " _ _Cap__ "). Purchaser shall not be required to indemnify any person
under Section 9.02(b) for an aggregate amount of Losses exceeding the Cap.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cap shall not apply to Losses related to
the breach of any representation or warranty contained in Sections 5.02(a),
5.02(b), 5.02(c), 5.02(e), 5.02(j), 5.02(p)(viii), 5.02(p)(ix), 5.02(p)(xv),
5.02(jj), 5.03(a), 5.03(b), 5.03(c), 5.03(e) or 5.03(j).

(c) Solely to the extent such indemnity obligations are not already limited
by Section 9.04(b), the Sellers shall not be required to indemnify any other
person under this Agreement (whether under this Article IX, Section 6.15(a) or
otherwise), or be liable to any other person for any other claim related to
this Agreement under any theory of recovery whatsoever, for Losses or Taxes
exceeding $9,000,000,000, in the aggregate, except with respect to (i) a
breach of representations and warranties in Sections 5.02(a), 5.02(b),
5.02(c), 5.02(e), 5.02(j), 5.02(p)(viii), 5.02(p)(ix) and 5.02(p)(xv) or (ii)
liabilities under Sections 6.15(a), 9.02(a)(ii), 9.02(a)(iii), 9.02(a)(iv), or
9.02(a)(v).

 



93 (d) For purposes of determining whether any such breach has occurred or
calculating Losses hereunder, any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or
similar qualification contained in the representations and warranties shall be
ignored.

9.05 _Adjustment to Losses_.

(a) _Insurance_. In calculating the amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is sought hereunder, the proceeds actually received by the
Seller Indemnified Parties or Purchaser Indemnified Parties, as applicable,
under any insurance policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or
payment by or against any other person, net of any deductible or actual costs
or expenses incurred in connection with securing or obtaining such proceeds,
shall be deducted from the amount of such Losses. The Seller Indemnified
Parties or Purchaser Indemnified Parties, as applicable, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to collect any amounts available under such
insurance coverage and from such other person alleged to have responsibility
for such Loss.

 

(b) _Reimbursement_. If a Seller Indemnified Party or Purchaser Indemnified
Party, as applicable, recovers an amount from a third party in respect of a
Loss that is the subject of indemnification under this Agreement after all or
a portion of such Loss has been paid by the other party pursuant to Section
6.15 or this Article IX, the Seller Indemnified Parties or
Purchaser Indemnified Parties, as applicable, shall promptly remit to the
other party the amount received from the third party in respect thereof (net
of any deductible or actual costs and expenses incurred in connection with
securing or obtaining such proceeds) up to the amount paid to the Seller
Indemnified Parties or Purchaser Indemnified Parties, as applicable, in
respect of such Loss.

(c) _Recovery Only Once_. No person may recover more than once under Section
6.15 or this Article IX in respect of any Loss.

 

9.06 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Sellers and the Purchaser
agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to Section 6.15 and this
Article IX as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all income tax purposes
except as otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning
of Section 1313 of the Code. Any amounts payable by the indemnifying party to
or on behalf of an indemnified party with respect to any Loss pursuant to this
Agreement (including under Section 6.15 or this Article IX) shall be (i)
increased to take account of any net Tax cost incurred by the indemnified
party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder (grossed up for
such increase) and (ii) reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit
realized by the indemnified party arising from the incurrence or payment of
any such Loss, in each case when and as such Tax cost or benefit is actually
realized through an increase or reduction of Taxes otherwise due.

9.07 _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Closing, Section 6.15 and this Article
IX shall provide the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims under
this Agreement, except in the case of fraud or willful breach of this
Agreement or with respect to matters for which the remedy of specific
performance, injunctive relief or other non-monetary equitable remedies are
available.

the case of an amendment, by Purchaser and each of the Sellers or, in the case
of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No

other oral or written agreements heretofore made. Other than as expressly set
forth in Sections 6.05(f), 6.16 and 9.02 nothing in this Agreement, express or

obligation under this Agreement to "cause" a Subsidiary of such Party or any
such Subsidiarys officers, directors, management or employees to take, or
refrain from taking, any action, or such action may be necessary to accomplish
the purposes of this Agreement, such obligation of such Party shall be deemed
to include an undertaking on the part of such Party to cause such Subsidiary
to take such necessary action. Wherever this Agreement provides that a
Subsidiary of a Party has an obligation to act or refrain from taking
any action, such Party shall be deemed to have an obligation under this
Agreement to "cause" such Subsidiary or any such Subsidiarys officers,
directors, management or employees to take, or refrain from taking, any
action, or such action as may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this
Agreement.

10.08 _Interpretation; Effect_. In this Agreement, except as context may

severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not

as it had for the original designee under Section 2.01(a).

 

Section 2.02. _Committees_. Following the Closing and prior to the
Representation Termination Date, to the extent permitted by applicable Law
(including any requirements under the Exchange Act or the rules of the NYSE or
any other applicable securities exchange on which the Common Stock is then
listed), the Board Representative shall be considered for service on one or
more of the committees of the Company Board to the extent such Board
Representative is qualified for service. Any such committee on which the Board

The Board Representative shall be entitled to compensation, reimbursement,

notify the Board Representative of all regular meetings and special meetings
of the Company Board and of all regular and special meetings of any committee
thereof at the same time and in the same manner as it notifies the other

occurrence of the Representation Termination Date, all obligations of the
Company and rights of the Shareholder pursuant to this Article II shall
terminate and Group shall cause, and the Board Representative shall promptly

of the Company Board, _provided_ that such termination shall not affect the
obligations of the Company to the Board Representative with respect to any
accrued but unpaid compensation and unreimbursed expenses in accordance with
Section 2.03 or the continuing indemnification obligation of the Company
with respect to the Board Representatives service on the Company Board. Any
public announcements relating to such resignation shall be mutually agreed by

-8-  ARTICLE III

_REGISTRATION RIGHTS_

Section 3.01. _Registration_. (a) (i). On or prior to the Lock-Up End Date,
the Company will either (i) file an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement
useable for the resale of Registrable Securities under the Securities Act,
(ii) amend an existing Automatic Shelf Registration Statement so that it is
useable for such resales or (iii) file a prospectus supplement that shall be
deemed to be part of an existing Automatic Shelf Registration Statement in
accordance with Rule 430B under the Securities Act that is useable for such
resales. Until such time as all Registrable Securities cease to be Registrable
Securities and the Company is no longer eligible to maintain an Automatic
Shelf Registration Statement, the Company will keep current and effective
an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement and file such supplements or
amendments to such Automatic Shelf Registration Statement as may be necessary
or appropriate in order to keep such Automatic Shelf Registration Statement
continuously effective and useable for the resale of Registrable Securities
under the Securities Act.

(ii) Upon the written request of Group from time to time (a " _ _Takedown
Request__ "), the Company will cooperate with Shareholder and any Underwriter
in effecting a Takedown Offering pursuant to an Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable following receipt of such
Takedown Request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
obligated to effect more than two Takedown Requests in any 12-month period.
Each Takedown Request will specify the number of Registrable Securities
proposed by Shareholder to be included in such Takedown Offering, the intended
method of distribution and the estimated gross proceeds of such Takedown
Offering, which may not be less than $200 million. Shareholder may change the
number of Registrable Securities proposed to be offered in any Takedown
Offering at any time prior to commencement of such offering so long as such
change would not materially adversely affect the timing or success of the
Takedown Offering or reduce the estimated gross proceeds of such Takedown
Offering to less than $200 million and provided that the Company shall be
entitled to reasonably delay a Takedown Offering as a result of such change.

 

(b) (i) If at any time after the Lock-Up End Date the Company is no longer
eligible to use an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement, within 30 days
after Groups written request to register the resale of a specified amount of
the Registrable Securities under the Securities Act (a " _ _Demand Notice__
"), the Company will file a Registration Statement, on an appropriate form
which the Company is then eligible to use, to register the resale of such
Registrable Securities, which Registration Statement will (if specified in
Groups notice) contemplate the ability of Shareholder to effect
an Underwritten Offering (each such registration, a " _ _Demand
Registration__ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
obligated to effect more than two Demand Registrations in any 12-month period.
Each Demand Notice will specify the number of Registrable Securities proposed
to be offered for sale, the intended method of distribution thereof and the
estimated gross proceeds of such Demand Registration, which may not be less
than $200 million. Shareholder may change the number of Registrable
Securities proposed to be offered pursuant to any Demand Registration at any
time prior to commencement of the offering so long as such change would not
materially adversely affect the timing or 

 



-9-   success of the offering or reduce the estimated gross proceeds of such
Demand Registration to less than $200 million. Subject to Section 3.03, the
Company may include in any registration effected pursuant to Section 3.01(a)
or Section 3.01(b) any securities for its own account or for the account of
holders of Common Stock (other than Shareholder).

 

(ii) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts (i) to cause any
Registration Statement to be declared effective (unless it becomes effective
automatically upon filing) as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof
with the SEC and (ii) to keep such Registration Statement current and
effective for a period of not less than 90 days, and in any event for so long
as necessary for the completion of the resale of Registrable Securities
registered thereon. The Company further agrees to supplement or make
amendments to each such Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep
such Registration Statement effective for the period referred to in clause
(ii) above, including (A) to respond to the comments of the SEC, if any, (B)
as may be required by the registration form utilized by the Company for
such Registration Statement or by the instructions to such registration form,
(C) as may be required by the Securities Act, (D) as may be required in
connection with a Takedown Offering or (E) as may be reasonably requested in
writing by Shareholder or any Underwriter and reasonably acceptable to the
Company. The Company agrees to furnish to Shareholder copies of any such
supplement or amendment no later than the time it is first being used or filed
with the SEC.

 

(c) In the event an offering of Registrable Securities (including in
connection with any Takedown Offering) under this Section 3.01 involves one
or more Underwriters, Group and the Company shall each be entitled to select
one internationally-recognized investment banking firm to serve as lead
Underwriters and Group shall have the right to select any additional
Underwriters in connection with the offering, provided that any Underwriter
must be reasonably acceptable to the Company and Group. The Company shall
reasonably assist such managing Underwriter or Underwriters in their efforts
to sell Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement and,
if reasonably requested in connection with any Takedown Offering or Demand
Registration that is an Underwritten Offering in which Shareholder intends to
sell Registrable Securities shall make senior executives with appropriate
seniority and expertise reasonably available for customary "road show" or
other presentations during the marketing period for such Registrable
Securities, in each case in connection with a maximum of two Underwritten
Offerings in any 12-month period (with an understanding that these shall be
scheduled in a collaborative manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of the Company). Subject to Section 3.03, if
the Company gives Group notice of a request by the Company or another holder
of the Companys securities to include any Equity Interests in any
Underwritten Offering, Shareholder shall offer to include such Equity
Interests in the Underwritten Offering.

(d) Shareholder will be permitted to rescind a Demand Registration or Takedown
Request or request the removal of any Registrable Securities held by it from
any Demand Registration or Takedown Request at any time; _provided_ , that
Shareholder reimburses the Company for all reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Company in connection with such Demand Registration or
Takedown Request.

 



-10-  Section 3.02. _Piggyback Registration_. If the Company proposes to file
a registration statement under the Securities Act or consummate a Takedown
Offering with respect to an offering of Equity Interests for (a) the Companys
own account (other than a Registration Statement on Form S-4 or S-8 (or any
substitute form that may be adopted by the SEC)) or (b) the account of any
holder of Equity Interests (other than Shareholder), then the Company shall
give written notice of such proposed filing or Takedown Offering to Group as
soon as practicable (but in no event less than 10 days before the anticipated
filing date); provided that the Company may determine in its sole discretion
in light of the purpose or objectives of an offering not to include any
Registrable Securities in such registration or offering. Upon a written
request, given by Group to the Company within 5 days after delivery of any
such notice by the Company, to include Registrable Securities in such
registration or Takedown Offering, as applicable (which request shall
specify the number of Registrable Securities proposed to be included in such
registration or Takedown Offering, as applicable), the Company shall, subject
to Section 3.03 and the proviso in the preceding sentence, include all such
requested Registrable Securities in such registration or Takedown Offering,
as applicable, on the same terms and conditions as applicable to the Companys
or such holders shares of Common Stock (or, in the event of an offering of
Equity Interests other than Common Stock, on terms as commercially comparable
as practicable) (a " _ _Piggyback Registration__ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if at any time after giving written notice of such proposed filing or
Takedown Offering, as applicable, and prior to the effective date of the
Registration Statement filed in connection with such registration, or the
consummation of such Takedown Offering, as applicable, the Company shall
determine for any reason not to proceed with the proposed registration or
disposition, as applicable, of the Equity Interests, then the Company may, at
its election, give written notice of such determination to Shareholder and,
thereupon, will be relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable
Securities in connection with such registration, or dispose of any Registrable
Securities in connection with such Takedown Offering, as applicable.
Shareholder shall, subject to Section 3.04(b), enter into an underwriting
agreement with the Underwriter or Underwriters selected by the Company with
respect to any Common Stock sold by Shareholder pursuant to this Section 3.02.

Section 3.03. _Reduction of Size of Underwritten Offering_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, if the lead Underwriter of an
Underwritten Offering advises the Company in writing that, in its reasonable
opinion the number of Equity Interests (including any Registrable Securities)
that the Company, Shareholder and any other persons intend to include in any
Registration Statement or dispose of pursuant to any Takedown Offering is
such that the success of any such offering would be materially and adversely
affected, including with respect to the price at which the securities can be
sold, then the number of shares of Common Stock or other Equity Interests to
be included in the Registration Statement, or disposed of pursuant to such
Takedown Offering, as applicable, for the account of the Company, Shareholder
and any other persons will be reduced to the extent necessary to reduce the
total number of securities to be included in any such Registration Statement
or disposed of pursuant to such Takedown Offering, as applicable, to the
number recommended by such lead Underwriter; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such reduction shall be made in accordance with the following priorities:

(a) priority in the case of a Demand Registration or Takedown Offering
pursuant to Section 3.01(a) or Section 3.01(b) will be (i) _first_ , all
Registrable Securities requested to be included in the Registration Statement,
or disposed of pursuant to the 

 



-11-   Takedown Offering, as applicable, for the account of Shareholder pursuant to
Section 3.01(a) or Section 3.01(b), (ii) _second_ , any Common Stock or other
Equity Interests proposed to be offered by the Company for its own account
and (iii) _third_ , _pro rata_ among any other holders of shares of Common
Stock or other Equity Interests requested to be registered, or disposed of, as
applicable, so that the total number of Equity Interests to be included in
any such offering for the account of all such persons will not exceed the
number recommended by such lead Underwriter;

 

(b) priority in the case of a registration statement or Takedown Offering
initiated by the Company for its own account which gives rise to a Piggyback
Registration pursuant to Section 3.02 will be (i) _first_ , Equity Interests
proposed to be offered by the Company for its own account, (ii) _second_ ,
the Registrable Securities requested to be included in the Registration
Statement, or disposed of pursuant to the Takedown Offering, as applicable,
for the account of Shareholder pursuant to Section 3.02 and (iii) _third_ ,
_pro rata_ among any other holders of Equity Interests requested to be
registered, or disposed of, as applicable, so that the total number of Equity
Interests to be included in any such offering for the account of all such
persons will not exceed the number recommended by such lead Underwriter; and

(c) priority in the case of a registration statement or Takedown Offering
initiated by the Company for the account of holders of Equity Interests other
than Shareholder pursuant to registration rights afforded to such holders
pursuant to a contractual right with the Company which gives rise to a
Piggyback Registration pursuant to Section 3.02 will be (i) _first_ , _pro
rata_ among the holders of Equity Interests requesting the offering pursuant
to such contractual right, (ii) _second_ , Registrable Securities requested
to be included in the Registration Statement, or disposed of, pursuant to the
Takedown Offering, for the account of Shareholder pursuant to its registration
rights under Section 3.02, (iii) _third_ , Equity Interests offered by the
Company for its own account and (iv) _fourth_ , _pro rata_ among any other
holders of Equity Interests requested to be registered, or disposed of, so
that the total number of Equity Interests to be included in any such offering
for the account of all such persons will not exceed the number recommended by
such lead Underwriter.

Section 3.04. _Registration Procedures_. (a) Subject to the provisions of
Section 3.01 or Section 3.02, in connection with the registration of the sale
of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Demand Registration, any Takedown
Offering or any Piggyback Registration hereunder, the Company will as
promptly as reasonably practicable:

(i) furnish to Shareholder without charge, prior to the filing of a
Registration Statement, copies of such Registration Statement as it is
proposed to be filed, and thereafter such number of copies of such
Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case
including all exhibits thereto, including each preliminary prospectus),
copies of any and all transmittal letters or other correspondence with the SEC
relating to such Registration Statement and such other documents in such
quantities as Shareholder may reasonably request from time to time in order
to facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities (including in
connection with any Takedown Offering), and give Shareholder and its
Representatives a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
same prior to filing any such documents;

 



-12-  (ii) (A) cause the Companys Representatives to supply all
information reasonably requested by Shareholder, any Underwriter, or their
Representatives in connection with the Registration Statement or Takedown
Offering and (B) provide Shareholder and its Representatives with the
opportunity to participate in the preparation of such Registration Statement
and the related Prospectus;

(iii) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable
Securities under such other securities or "blue sky" laws of such
jurisdictions as Shareholder reasonably requests and do any and all other acts
and things as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable Shareholder
to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such
jurisdictions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall in no event be
required to (w) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it
is not then so qualified, (x) subject itself to taxation in any jurisdiction
where is not otherwise then so subject, (y) take any action that would subject
it to service of process in suits other than those arising out of the offer
and sale of the securities covered by the Registration Statement or (z)
consent to general service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not then
so subject;

 

(iv) notify Shareholder at any time when a prospectus relating to Registrable
Securities is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the
happening of any event as a result of which the Prospectus included in a
Registration Statement or the Registration Statement or amendment or
supplement relating to such Registrable Securities contains an untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and the Company
will promptly prepare and file with the SEC a supplement or amendment to such
prospectus and Registration Statement (and comply fully with the applicable
provisions of Rules 424, 430A and 430B under the Securities Act in a timely
manner) so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable
Securities, such prospectus and Registration Statement will not contain an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

(v) advise the Underwriter(s), if any, and Shareholder promptly and, if
requested by such persons, confirm such advice in writing, of the issuance by
the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement under the Securities Act or of the suspension by any state
securities commission of the qualification of the Registrable Securities for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation of any proceeding for
any of the preceding purposes. If at any time the SEC shall issue any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, or any state
securities commission or other regulatory authority shall issue an order
suspending the qualification or exemption from qualification of the
Registrable Securities under state securities or "blue sky" laws, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal or lifting of
such order as promptly as practicable;

 



-13-  (vi) use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registrable Securities
to be registered with or approved by such other Governmental Entities as may
be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the Company to enable
Shareholder to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities
(including in connection with any Takedown Offering); _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company shall in no event be required to (w) qualify generally to
do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified, (x) subject
itself to taxation in any jurisdiction where is not otherwise then so
subject, (y) take any action that would subject it to service of process in
suits other than those arising out of the offer and sale of the securities
covered by the Registration Statement or (z) consent to general service of
process in any jurisdiction where it is not then so subject;

 

(vii) enter into customary agreements and use reasonable best efforts to take
such other actions as are reasonably requested by Shareholder in order to
expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities,
including, subject to the provisions of Section 3.01(c) with respect to
Underwritten Offerings, preparing for and participating in a road show and
all such other customary selling efforts as the Underwriters, if any, or
Shareholder, reasonably request in order to expedite or facilitate such
disposition;

 

(viii) if requested by Shareholder or the Underwriter(s), if any, promptly
include in any Registration Statement or Prospectus, pursuant to a supplement
or post-effective amendment if necessary, such information as Shareholder and
such Underwriter(s), if any, may reasonably request to have included therein,
including information relating to the "Plan of Distribution" of the
Registrable Securities, information with respect to the number of Registrable
Securities being sold to such Underwriter(s), the purchase price being paid
therefor and any other terms of the offering of the Registrable Securities to
be sold in such offering, and make all required filings of such prospectus
supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as practicable after the
Company is notified of the matters to be included in such prospectus
supplement or post-effective amendment;

(ix) except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law and subject to entry
into a customary confidentiality agreement or arrangement, make available,
after reasonable advance notice, for inspection by Shareholder, any
Underwriter participating in any disposition of such Registrable Securities,
and any Representative for Shareholder and/or such Underwriter (collectively,
the " _ _Inspectors__ "), during business hours at the offices where such
information is normally kept, any financial and other records and corporate
documents of the Company (collectively, the " _ _Records__ ") as will be
reasonably necessary to enable them to conduct reasonable and customary due
diligence with respect to the Company and the related Registration Statement
and prospectus and request the Representatives of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to supply all information reasonably requested by any such
Inspector; _provided_ , _however_ , that Records and information obtained
hereunder will be used by such Inspectors only to conduct such due diligence;

 



-14-  (x) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to each Underwriter
and Shareholder a comfort letter from the independent registered public
accounting firm for the Company (and additional comfort letters from the
independent registered public accounting firm for any company acquired by the
Company whose financial statements are included or incorporated by reference
in the Registration Statement) in customary form and covering such matters as
are customarily covered by comfort letters as such Underwriter and Shareholder
may reasonably request;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company fails
to obtain such comfort letter and the relevant offering is abandoned, then
such Demand Registration or Takedown Offering will not count as a Demand
Registration or Takedown Offering, as applicable, for purposes of determining
when future Demand Registrations or Takedown Offerings may be requested by
Shareholder pursuant to Section 3.01(a) or Section 3.01(b);

 

(xi) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to each Underwriter
and Shareholder a 10b-5 statement and legal opinion from the Companys
counsel in customary form and covering such matters as are customarily covered
by 10b-5 statements and legal opinions delivered to Underwriters in
Underwritten Offerings as such Underwriter and/or Shareholder may reasonably
request; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company fails to obtain such
statement or opinion and the relevant offering is abandoned, then such Demand
Registration or Takedown Offering will not count as a Demand Registration
or Takedown Offering, as applicable, for purposes of determining when future
Demand Registrations or Takedown Offerings may be requested by Shareholder
pursuant to Section 3.01(a) or Section 3.01(b);

 

(xii) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC and make generally available to its security
holders, within the required time period, an earnings statement covering a
period of 12 months, beginning with the first fiscal quarter after the
effective date of the Registration Statement relating to such Registrable
Securities (as the term "effective date" is defined in Rule 158(c) under the
Securities Act), which earnings statement will satisfy the provisions of
Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder or any successor
provisions thereto;

(xiii) use reasonable best efforts to provide and cause to be maintained
a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement not later than the effective date of such Registration
Statement;

 

(xiv) cooperate with Shareholder and the lead Underwriter or Underwriters, if
any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates
representing the Registrable Securities to be sold under the Registration
Statement in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company not
bearing any restrictive legends and not subject to any stop transfer order
with any transfer agent, and cause such Registrable Securities to be issued in
such denominations and registered in such names as the lead Underwriter or
Underwriters, if any, may request in writing or, if not an
Underwritten Offering, in accordance with the instructions of Shareholder, in
each case in connection with the closing of any sale of Registrable
Securities;

 



-15-  (xv) not later than the effective date of the applicable
Registration Statement, provide a CUSIP number for all Registrable
Securities; and

(xvi) use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registrable Securities to
be listed or quoted on the NYSE or, if Common Stock is not then listed on the
NYSE, then on such other securities exchange or national quotation system on
which the Common Stock is then listed or quoted. 

(b) In connection with the Registration Statement relating to such Registrable
Securities covering an Underwritten Offering (including any Takedown
Offering), the Company and Shareholder agree to enter into a written agreement
with the Underwriters selected in the manner herein provided in such form and
containing such provisions as are customary in the securities business for
such an arrangement (it being understood that, unless required otherwise by
the Securities Act or any other Law, the Company will not require Shareholder
to make any representation, warranty or agreement in such agreement other
than with respect to Shareholder, authority to enter into the underwriting
agreement, the ownership of Shareholders securities being registered and
Shareholders intended method of disposition, or information furnished by
Shareholder expressly for use in any Registration Statement, Prospectus or
Prospectus supplement). In the event an Underwritten Offering is not
consummated because any condition to the obligations under any related written
agreement with such Underwriters is not met or waived in connection with a
Demand Registration or Takedown Offering, and such failure to be met or waived
is not attributable to the fault of Shareholder, such Demand Registration or
Takedown Offering, as applicable, will not count as a Demand Registration or
Takedown Offering for purposes of determining when future Demand Registrations
or Takedown Offerings may be requested by Shareholder pursuant to Section
3.01(a) or Section 3.01(b).

 

Section 3.05. _Conditions to Offerings_. (a) The obligations of the Company to
take the actions contemplated by Section 3.01, Section 3.02 and Section 3.04
with respect to an offering of Registrable Securities (including any Takedown
Offering) will be subject to the following conditions:

 

(i) The Company may require Shareholder to furnish to the Company such
information regarding Shareholder, the Registrable Securities or the
distribution of such Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to
time reasonably request in writing, in each case to the extent reasonably
required by the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or under state securities or "blue sky" laws;

(ii) in any Underwritten Offering pursuant to Section 3.01 or Section 3.02
hereof, Shareholder, together with the Company and any other holders of the
Companys securities proposing to include securities in any Underwritten
Offering, will enter into an underwriting agreement in accordance with
Section 3.04(b) with the Underwriter or Underwriters selected for such
underwriting, as well as such other documents customary in similar offerings;
and

 

(iii) the Companys obligations will be suspended during any period in which
Group and Groups accountants have not, following reasonable prior request
from the Company, timely provided any information required to be provided by
them with

 



-16-   respect to the Sales Package Companies related to periods prior to the
Closing and required by applicable Law to be included or incorporated by
reference into any Registration Statement. 

(b) Shareholder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of
the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3.04(a)(iv) or
3.04(a)(v) or a condition described in Section 3.06, Shareholder will
forthwith discontinue disposition of such Registrable Securities pursuant to
the Registration Statement covering the sale of such Registrable Securities
or Takedown Offering until Shareholders receipt of the copies of the
supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 3.04(a)(iv) or
notice from the Company of the termination of the stop order or Suspension
Period. 

Section 3.06. _Suspension Period_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)
Shareholder shall suspend the use of the Prospectus included in any Automatic
Shelf Registration Statement or Registration Statement for resales of
Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 3.01 and postpone the filing and
suspend the use of any Registration Statement pursuant to Section 3.01, in
each case during any Scheduled Black-out Period and (ii) the Company shall be
entitled, from time to time, by providing prior written notice to Group, to
require Shareholder to suspend the use of the Prospectus included in any
Automatic Shelf Registration Statement for resales of Registrable Securities
pursuant to Section 3.01(a) or Section 3.02 or to postpone the filing or
suspend the use of any Registration Statement pursuant to Section 3.01(b)
or Section 3.02 for a reasonable period of time not to exceed 45 days in
succession (or a longer period of time with the prior written consent of
Group, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), 45 days in the
aggregate in any one-year period or two times in any one-year period1 (a " _
_Suspension Period__ ") if (A) the chief executive officer or chief financial
officer of the Company determines in good faith that effecting the
registration (or permitting sales under an effective registration) would
materially adversely affect an offering of securities of the Company, (B) the
Company is in possession of material non-public information and the chief
executive officer or chief financial officer of the Company determines in good
faith that the disclosure of such information during the period specified in
such notice would be materially detrimental to the Company, or (C) the
Company shall determine that it is required to disclose in any such
Registration Statement a contemplated financing, acquisition, corporate
reorganization or other similar transaction or other material event or
circumstance affecting the Company or its securities, and the chief executive
officer or chief financial officer of the Company determines in good faith
that the disclosure of such information at such time would be materially
detrimental to the Company or the holders of its Common Stock. In the event
of any such suspension pursuant to clause (ii), the Company shall furnish to
Group a written notice setting forth the estimated

 



   1  | If the date of the Company Public Offering is within the fourth
calendar quarter of 2011, the execution version of the Agreement will be
revised to provide that the Company will be limited to exercising only one
Suspension Period (for the avoidance of doubt, for a reasonable period of time
not to exceed 45 days in succession (or a longer period of time with the prior
written consent of Group, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld))
in the 2012 calendar year. 
---|--- 
 



-17-   length of the anticipated delay. The Company will notify Shareholder
promptly upon the termination of the Suspension Period. Upon notice by the
Company to Shareholder of any determination to commence a Suspension Period,
Shareholder shall, except as required by applicable Law, including any
disclosure obligations under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, keep the fact of
any such Suspension Period strictly confidential, and during any Suspension
Period, promptly halt any offer, sale (including sales pursuant to Rule 144),
trading or transfer of any Common Stock for the duration of the Suspension
Period until the Company has provided notice that the Suspension Period has
been terminated. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this
Section 3.06 shall relieve the Company of its obligations under Section 3.01.

(b) After the expiration of any Suspension Period and without any further
request from a holder of Equity Interests, the Company shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable prepare a Registration Statement or post-effective
amendment or supplement to the applicable shelf Registration Statement or
Prospectus, or any document incorporated therein by reference, or file any
other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the
Registrable Securities included therein, the Prospectus will not include a
material misstatement or omission or be not effective and useable for resale
of Registrable Securities.

 

Section 3.07. _Registration Expenses_. All fees and expenses incident to the
Companys performance of or compliance with the obligations of this Article
III, including all fees and expenses incurred in complying with securities or
"blue sky" laws, printing expenses, messenger and delivery expenses of the
Company, any registration or filing fees payable under any federal or state
securities or "blue sky" laws, the fees and expenses incurred in connection
with any listing or quoting of the securities to be registered on any national
securities exchange or automated quotation system, fees of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, fees and disbursements of counsel for the
Company, its independent registered certified public accounting firm and any
other public accountants who are required to deliver comfort letters
(including the expenses required by or incident to such performance),
transfer taxes, fees of transfer agents and registrars, costs of insurance,
the fees and out of pocket expenses of other persons retained by the Company,
any fees and expenses of Groups or its Affiliates Representatives, and any
other fees and expenses incurred in connection with a Takedown Offering,
Demand Registration or Piggyback Registration will be borne by the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Shareholder will bear and pay any underwriting
discounts, fees, commissions and related fees and out of pocket expenses of
any Underwriters and such Underwriters counsel applicable to Registrable
Securities offered for its account pursuant to any Registration Statement
(including in connection with any Takedown Offering).

Section 3.08. _Indemnification; Contribution_. (a) In connection with any
registration of Registrable Securities or Takedown Offering pursuant to
Section 3.01 or Section 3.02, the Company will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Shareholder, its Affiliates, directors, officers and shareholders
and each person who controls Shareholder within the meaning of either Section
15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act (collectively, the
" _ _Indemnified Persons__ ") from and against any and all Losses caused by
any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any part
of any Registration Statement or any Prospectus, including any amendment or
supplement thereto, used in connection with the Registrable Securities or any
Issuer FWP, or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the

 



-18-   statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company will not be required to indemnify any
Indemnified Person for any Losses resulting from any such untrue statement or
omission if such untrue statement or omission was made in reliance on and in
conformity with information with respect to any Indemnified Person furnished
to the Company in writing by, or at direction of, Shareholder or any
Indemnified Person expressly for use therein.

 

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement, Prospectus or Issuer FWP,
Shareholder will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its
directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls the Company
(within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20
of the Exchange Act) to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from
the Company to Shareholder, but only with respect to information furnished to
the Company in writing by, or at direction of, any Shareholder or any
Indemnified Persons expressly for use in such Registration Statement,
Prospectus or Issuer FWP. 

(c) In case any claim, action or proceeding (including any governmental
investigation) is instituted involving any person in respect of which
indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 3.08(a) or Section 3.08(b), such
person (the " _ _Indemnified Party__ ") will promptly notify the person
against whom such indemnity may be sought (the " _ _Indemnifying Party__ ")
in writing and the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate therein
and, to the extent it shall wish, to assume the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and will pay the fees and
disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the failure or delay to give such notice shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement except
to the extent such Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced by such failure or
delay. In any such claim, action or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such defense
and to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will
be at the expense of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party have mutually agreed to the retention of such
counsel, (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of the
claim, action or proceeding within 15 Business Days following receipt of
notice from the Indemnified Party, or (iii) the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party are both actual or potential defendants in, or targets of,
any such action and the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due
to actual or potential conflicting interests between them. It is understood
that the Indemnifying Party will not, in connection with any claim, action or
proceeding or related claims, actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction,
be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm
of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all such
Indemnified Parties and that all such reasonable fees and expenses will be
reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of the retention of any such
separate firm for the Indemnified Parties, such firm will be designated in
writing by the Indemnified Parties. The Indemnifying Party will not be liable
for any settlement of any claim, action or proceeding effected without its
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), but if such claim, action or proceeding is settled
with such consent or if there has been a final judgment for the plaintiff, the
Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against
any Loss by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Party will,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise
or offer to settle or compromise any pending or threatened proceeding in
respect of

 



-19-   which any Indemnified Party is seeking indemnity hereunder, unless such
settlement includes (i) an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party
from all liability in connection with such proceeding, (ii) no finding or
admission of any violation of Law or any violation of the rights of any person
by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates can be made as the result of
such action, and (iii) the sole relief (if any) provided is monetary damages
that are reimbursed in full by the Indemnifying Party. No Indemnified Party
will, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, settle,
compromise or offer to settle or compromise any pending or
threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is seeking
indemnity hereunder.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 3.08 from the
Indemnifying Party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder or is
insufficient in respect of any Losses referred to in this Section 3.08, then
the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, will
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result
of such Losses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in connection
with the actions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is
not permitted by applicable Law, in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect not only the relative fault referred to in clause (i) but also the
relative benefit of the Company, on the one hand, and Shareholder, on the
other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such
Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party will be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including
any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to
information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the
parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a party as a
result of the Losses referred to above will be deemed to include, subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 3.08(c), any reasonable legal or other
out of pocket fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection
with any investigation or proceeding.

(e) The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to Section 3.08(d) were determined by _pro rata_ allocation or by any
other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable
considerations referred to in Section 3.08(d). No person guilty of "fraudulent
misrepresentation" (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section
3.08(e), Shareholder shall not be required to contribute, in the aggregate,
any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by
Shareholder from the sale of the Registrable Securities exceeds the amount of
any damages which Shareholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of
such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.

(f) If indemnification is available under this Section 3.08, the Indemnifying
Party will indemnify each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permissible
under applicable Law provided in Sections 3.08(a) and 3.08(b) without regard
to the relative fault of said Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party or any
other equitable consideration provided for in Section 3.08(d) or 3.08(e). The
obligations of the Company under this Section 3.08 shall be in addition to any
liability that the Company may otherwise have to any Indemnified Person.

 



-20-  Section 3.09. _Rule 144_. For so long as the Company is subject to
the requirements of Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company
agrees that it will file the reports required to be filed by it under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and take such further action as
Shareholder reasonably may request (including providing Shareholder with such
information as may be required in order to enable Shareholder to make sales
within the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144), all to the
extent required from time to time to enable Shareholder to sell Registrable
Securities pursuant to the exemptions provided by Rule 144.

Section 3.10. _Transfer of Registration Rights_. The rights granted to
Shareholder under this Article III may not be assigned by Shareholder in whole
or in part other than to a Subsidiary of Group to whom Shareholder Transfers
Shares.

during the Standstill Period, Group shall not, and shall not permit its
controlled Affiliates to: (a) make, or in any way participate in, any
"solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are defined under Regulation 14A
under the Exchange Act) to vote, or seek to advise or influence any person 

 



-21-   or entity with respect to the voting of, any voting securities of the

which could require the Company to make a public announcement regarding any of

Section 4.03. _Permitted Activities_. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 4.01 or Section 4.02, or any other provision of this Agreement, to
the contrary, the parties agree that none of Section 4.01 or Section 4.02,
shall prevent, limit or affect in any manner whatsoever, Group or any of its
Affiliates from: engaging in any activities on behalf of clients in
connection with brokerage, custodial, discretionary and other money and asset
management, mutual and other similar fund or research businesses, activities
and services in the ordinary course of its business; _provided_ that
the purpose of Group or its Affiliates is not to avoid the provisions of
Section 4.01 or Section 4.02.

 

Section 4.04. _Lock-Up_. Prior to the Lock-Up End Date, Shareholder shall not
Transfer or announce any intention to Transfer any Shares (provided that such
restriction shall not apply to Transfers of Shares between or among Group and
its Subsidiaries or controlled Affiliates or Transfers contemplated by Section
5.02(a) or 5.02(b)).

 

Section 4.05. _Transfer Restrictions_.

(a) Shareholder shall not Transfer any Shares:

(i) in a transaction with any person or "group" (within the meaning of
Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) where any such person or "group" would
acquire, in such transaction, beneficial ownership of an aggregate number of
Shares representing 2.0 percent or more of the outstanding shares of the
Common Stock (or 4.0 percent or more of the outstanding shares of the Common
Stock, if such transaction is conducted in connection with an Underwritten
Offering); or

 

(ii) on any given day in an amount greater than 20 percent of the average
daily trading volume of Common Stock for the 20-trading day period
immediately preceding the date of such Transfer, other than in connection with
an Underwritten Offering.

 

(b) The restrictions set forth in this Section 4.05 shall not apply to
Transfers of Shares between or among Group and its Subsidiaries or controlled
Affiliates. In the event that any Subsidiary of Group that owns Shares ceases
to be a wholly owned Subsidiary or controlled Affiliate of Group, then such
Subsidiary shall immediately Transfer its Shares to Group or a Subsidiary or
controlled Affiliate of Group.

Section 4.06. _Passivity Commitments_. Group agrees that it will, and will
cause Shareholder and any of its Affiliates to, comply with any passivity
commitments or similar restrictions required under applicable Law, including
without limitation any such commitments or restrictions imposed by the Federal
Reserve. 

 



-22-  Section 4.07. _Transfer Agent_. Group and the Company agree that the Company
may cause the transfer agent or other registrar to enter stop transfer
instructions and implement stop transfer procedures with respect to any
Transfer of Shares not in compliance with Section 4.04 or Section 4.05. Any
Transfer or attempted Transfer of Shares in violation of Section 4.04 or
Section 4.05 shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be null and void
_ab initio_.

Section 4.08. _Legends_. Any certificates for Shares issued to Shareholder
shall bear a legend or legends (and appropriate comparable notations or other
arrangements will be made with respect to any uncertificated shares)
referencing restrictions on transfer of such Shares under the Securities Act
and under this Agreement which legend shall state in substance:

"The securities evidenced by this certificate have been issued and sold
without registration under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), or the securities laws of any state of
the United States (a " _State Act_ ") in reliance upon certain exemptions from
registration under said acts. The securities evidenced by this certificate
cannot be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred within the United States
unless such sale, assignment or other transfer is (i) made pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act and in accordance
with each applicable State Act or (ii) exempt from, or not subject to, the
Securities Act and each applicable State Act. If the proposed sale, assignment
or other transfer within the United States will be made pursuant to clause
(ii) above, the holder must, prior to such sale, assignment or
other transfer, furnish to the issuer such customary certifications, legal
opinions and other information as the issuer may reasonably require to
determine that such sale, assignment or other transfer is being made in
accordance with such clause. 

The securities evidenced by this certificate are subject to restrictions on
transfer set forth in a Shareholders Agreement dated _ _,
among the Company and certain other parties thereto (a copy of which is on
file with the Secretary of the Company)."

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any certificate(s) for Shares
shall be entitled to receive from the Company new certificates for a like
number of Shares not bearing such legend (or the elimination or termination of
such notations or arrangements) upon the request of such holder at (i) such
time as such restrictions are no longer applicable, and (ii) with

 



-23-   respect to the restriction on transfer of such shares under the Securities
Act, delivery of a customary opinion of counsel to such holder, which opinion
is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Company and its
counsel, that the restriction referenced in such legend (or such notations or
arrangements) is no longer required in order to ensure compliance with the
Securities Act.

 

Section 4.09. _Section 16 Matters_. Upon reasonable prior written request of
Group with respect to any transactions undertaken or to be undertaken by the
Board Representative, Group and its Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates
involving any Equity Interests, the Company shall take all necessary action to
cause the applicable transactions to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 under the
Exchange Act to the maximum extent permitted under applicable Law. Group shall
comply in all material respects with the beneficial ownership reporting
requirements under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, as such requirements may
apply to its beneficial ownership of Common Stock.

ARTICLE V

 

 _COVENANTS_

Section 5.01. _Access to Information_. Without limitation to any provision of
the Purchase Agreement, following the Closing until such date as they have
sold 75% or more of the Shares to third parties, to the extent permitted
under applicable Law, upon reasonable prior written notice, the Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the Representatives of the Company to, as
permitted by applicable Law, solely to the extent necessary or advisable for
Group to respond to requirements of or inquiries from Governmental
Authorities, afford Group and its Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to the books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries other than information
designated by the Company as proprietary or competitively sensitive;
_provided_ that the Company shall not be required to (or to cause any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives to) afford such access to the extent that
doing so would violate any contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to
a third party or result in the loss of attorney-client privilege if, in the
case of any such contract or confidentiality obligation, the Company shall
have used its reasonable best efforts to have obtained the consent of such
third party to such access and/or mitigated the attorney-client privilege
concerns, in which case the Company and Group will make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements.

Section 5.02. _Regulatory Matters_. (a) Each of the Company and
Shareholder agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to
ensure, including by communicating with each other with respect to their
respective purchases of Common Stock, that neither Shareholder nor any of its
Affiliates will become, or control, a "bank holding company" within the
meaning of the BHC Act, a "savings and loan holding company" within the
meaning of the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act or be required to file a
notice of any type under the CBC Act, or otherwise become subject to
regulation by a regulatory body due, in any such case, to Shareholders
ownership of Common Stock or relationship with the Company pursuant hereto or
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (each, a " _ _Company Control Effect__ ").
The Shareholder shall not take any action which it knows would or would
reasonably be expected to cause a Company Control Effect with respect to
Shareholder or any of its Affiliates. The 

 



-24-   Company shall not take any action which it knows would or would reasonably
be expected to cause a Company Control Effect with respect to Shareholder or
any of its Affiliates, provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement
shall be construed to preclude the Company or any of the Companys Affiliates
from undertaking any redemption, recapitalization, or repurchase of Common
Stock, of securities or rights, options, or warrants to purchase Common
Stock, or securities of any type whatsoever that are, or may become,
convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for Common Stock in each
case, provided that, where there is a reasonable risk that such action
would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Control Effect,
Shareholder is given the right to participate (on the same terms generally
offered by the Company to other securityholders) in such redemption,
recapitalization, or repurchase _pro rata_ (in accordance with the
Shareholder Percentage Interest) (it being understood that Shareholder shall
promptly inform the Company of its determination as to whether to participate
and that, if it does not participate, it shall promptly dispose of a number
of shares of Common Stock necessary to avoid a Company Control Effect arising
from such redemption, recapitalization or repurchase).

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, in no event will Shareholder
or its Affiliates be obligated to:

(i) without limitation to clause (ii) below, (A) propose or accept any
divestiture of any of Shareholders or any of its Affiliates assets, or (B)
accept any operational restriction on Shareholders or any of its Affiliates
business, or agree to take any action that limits Shareholders or its
Affiliates commercial practices in any way (except as they relate to the
Company and its Subsidiaries) to maintain its investment hereunder other than
according to any customary commitments provided to the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System; or

(ii) propose or agree to accept any term or condition or otherwise modify the
terms of this Agreement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, the terms or
the amount of any Equity Interests that may be required to be delivered by
the Company under this Agreement.

(c) Group agrees that it will use its reasonable best efforts to, and cause
its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, (i) prepare and file with any applicable
Governmental Entity, or provide to the Company, as applicable, such
applications, reports, filings or other documents or information by or with
respect to Group and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates as may be reasonably
required in order for the Company to comply with applicable Law or the
requirements of any Governmental Entity with respect to any action,
transaction or approval sought by the Company, and (ii) otherwise reasonably
cooperate with the Company with respect to any such action, transaction,
approval, application, report, filing or other document.

(d) The Company agrees that it will use its reasonable best efforts to, and
cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, (i) prepare and file with any
applicable Governmental Entity, or provide to Group, as applicable, such
applications, reports, filings or other documents or information by or with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates as may be
reasonably required in order for Group to comply with applicable Law or
the requirements of any Governmental Entity with respect to any action,
transaction, Transfer or approval sought by Group, and (ii) otherwise
reasonably cooperate with Group with respect to any such action, transaction,
approval, application, report, filing or other document.
