<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;), dated as of June&nbsp;5, 2005, is by
and among PROLOGIS, a Maryland real estate investment trust (&#147;<U>ProLogis</U>&#148;), PALMTREE
ACQUISITION CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Merger Sub</U>&#148;), and CATELLUS DEVELOPMENT
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Catellus</U>&#148;).


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>RECITALS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;The Board of Directors of Catellus has determined that it is advisable and in the best
interests of Catellus and its stockholders, and the Board of Trustees of ProLogis has determined
that it is advisable and in the best interests of ProLogis and its shareholders, that, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Catellus will be merged with and
into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving corporation in the merger (the
&#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;As a condition and inducement to the willingness of ProLogis to enter into this Agreement
and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, ProLogis has required the Persons set forth on
<U>Exhibit&nbsp;A</U> (collectively, the &#147;<U>Specified Holders</U>&#148;) to enter into a voting agreement,
of even date herewith (the &#147;<U>Voting Agreements</U>&#148;), pursuant to which, among other things,
each Specified Holder agrees to vote all shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Catellus (&#147;<U>Catellus Common Shares</U>&#148;) beneficially owned by such Specified Holder in favor of
the Merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;ProLogis, Catellus and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;It is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
&#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;), and that this Agreement shall constitute a plan of reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Code.


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>AGREEMENT</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consideration of the premises and the mutual representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>ARTICLE I</B><BR>
<U><B>THE MERGER</B></U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.1 <U>The Merger</U>. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the &#147;<U>DGCL</U>&#148;), Catellus shall merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger
Sub being the surviving corporation of the Merger (the &#147;<U>Surviving Corporation</U>&#148;), and the
separate corporate existence of Catellus shall thereupon cease. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in this <U>Article&nbsp;I</U> and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Prior to the Effective Time, Catellus shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to
provide that, as of the Effective Time, each restricted stock award and each restricted stock unit
award (including all restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance unit awards granted
pursuant to Catellus&#146;s Long-Term Incentive Plan and Catellus&#146;s Transition Incentive Plan, director
stock units and restricted director stock units) (the &#147;<U>Catellus RSUs</U>&#148;) granted under the
Catellus Stock Option Plans whether or not vested at the Effective Time shall be canceled and, in
exchange therefor, each former holder of any such canceled Catellus RSU shall be entitled to
receive, in consideration of such cancellation, an amount equal to the RSU Consideration subject
to applicable tax withholding. For purposes of this Agreement, the term &#147;<U>RSU
Consideration</U>&#148; means with respect to a Catellus RSU an amount equal to the product of (x)&nbsp;the
total number of Catellus Common Shares subject to such Catellus RSU immediately prior to its
cancellation and (y) $33.81. The &#147;<U>Net RSU Payment</U>&#148; is the RSU Consideration reduced by
such aggregate amount as is required to be withheld with respect to the RSU Consideration under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. Each former holder of any canceled Catellus
RSU shall receive a Net RSU Payment in the form of (i)&nbsp;a number of ProLogis Common Shares equal to
65% of the Net RSU Payment (based on the closing price of a ProLogis Common Share on the last
business day immediately prior to the Closing Date) and

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(ii)&nbsp;an amount of cash equal to 35% of the Net RSU Payment. As soon as practicable following
the Effective Time, ProLogis shall provide each holder of Catellus RSUs that are canceled pursuant
to this <U>Section&nbsp;1.11(b)</U> with a payment as described in this <U>Section&nbsp;1.11(b)</U>, and
any such canceled Catellus RSU shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but
shall only entitle such holder to the payment described in this <U>Section&nbsp;1.11(b)</U>. By virtue
of the foregoing treatment of the Catellus RSUs, the parties agree that no Person shall have any
right under or with respect to any Catellus RSU after the Effective Time other than the right to
receive the applicable payment (if any) due pursuant to this <U>Section&nbsp;1.11(b)</U>.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;As of the Effective Time, the Catellus Stock Option Plans shall be terminated and no
further awards or grants shall be made thereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.12 <U>Appraisal Rights</U>. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Catellus Common Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that are held by holders who have not voted in favor of the approval of this Agreement and
the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who have properly demanded appraisal for such
Catellus Common Shares in accordance with the DGCL (the &#147;<U>Dissenting Shares</U>&#148;) shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with <U>Section
1.6</U>, but shall represent and become the right to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due such holders pursuant to the Laws of the State of Delaware, unless and until
any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holder&#146;s right to appraisal
under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses its right to appraisal, such holder&#146;s Catellus Common Shares shall be treated as if
they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive, upon surrender as
provided above, the Cash Consideration, without any interest, and such Catellus Common Shares shall
no longer be Dissenting Shares. Catellus shall give ProLogis prompt notice of any demands received
by Catellus for appraisal of Catellus Common Shares, and ProLogis shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of ProLogis or as may otherwise be required by applicable Law, Catellus shall
not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.13 <U>Tax Treatment</U>. The parties intend, that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code and that
this Agreement shall constitute a plan of reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.14 <U>Withholding Rights</U>. Each of the Exchange Agent, ProLogis and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this <U>Article&nbsp;I</U> such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the Exchange
Agent, ProLogis or the Surviving Corporation so withholds or deducts any amount, such amount shall
be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Catellus
Common Shares, Catellus Options or Catellus RSUs in respect of which the Exchange Agent, ProLogis
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction or withholding.

<U><B>REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</B></U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;2.1 <U>Representations and Warranties of Catellus</U>. Catellus represents and
warrants to ProLogis and Merger Sub as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;<U>Organization, Standing and Corporate Power of Catellus</U>. Catellus is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and
has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now being conducted. Catellus is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business it is
conducting, or the ownership, operation or leasing of its properties or the management of
properties for others makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have, or would not be reasonably expected to have, a Catellus Material Adverse Effect.
&#147;<U>Catellus Material Adverse Effect</U>&#148; means (x)&nbsp;a material adverse effect on the business,
properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of Catellus and the
Catellus Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y)&nbsp;the effect of preventing or materially delaying the
performance by Catellus of any of its obligations under this Agreement or the consummation of the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>,
that a Catellus Material Adverse Effect shall not include any change with respect to Catellus or
any Catellus Subsidiary to the extent resulting from or attributable to (i)&nbsp;any change in general
national or international economic, financial or political conditions or events, including the
effects of terrorist acts that do not result in the destruction or material physical damage of a
material portion of Catellus&#146;s real properties, (ii)&nbsp;the announcement, pendency or consummation of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii)&nbsp;any change in conditions generally
affecting the securities markets or the industry in which Catellus and the Catellus Subsidiaries
operate that does not affect Catellus or any Catellus Subsidiary to a materially greater extent
than such change affects other Persons in the industry in which Catellus and the Catellus
Subsidiaries operate. Catellus has heretofore made available to ProLogis complete and correct
copies of the Catellus Certificate of Incorporation, as amended and supplemented to the date
hereof, and the Catellus By-laws, as amended to the date hereof. Each jurisdiction in which
Catellus is qualified or licensed to do business and each assumed name under which it conducts
business in any jurisdiction are identified in <U>Schedule&nbsp;2.1(a)</U> of the Disclosure Letter
dated as of the date of this Agreement and delivered to ProLogis in connection with the execution
hereof (the &#147;<U>Catellus Disclosure Letter</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<U>Catellus Subsidiaries; Catellus Joint Ventures</U>. (i)&nbsp;Each Catellus Subsidiary
that is a corporation is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of
its jurisdiction of incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each Catellus
Subsidiary that is a partnership, limited liability company or trust is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has the
requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business
as now being conducted. Each Catellus Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
operation or leasing of its properties or the management of properties for others makes such

so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Catellus Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in <U>Schedule&nbsp;2.1(b)(i)</U> of the
Catellus Disclosure Letter, all outstanding shares of capital stock of each Catellus Subsidiary
that is a corporation have been duly authorized, are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable,

Catellus or a Catellus Subsidiary that is a partnership, limited liability company, trust or other

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) <U>Schedule&nbsp;2.1(b)(ii)</U> of the Catellus Disclosure Letter sets forth (A)&nbsp;all

Venture. Except for the capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the Catellus Subsidiaries
and the other interests disclosed in <U>Schedule&nbsp;2.1(b)(ii)</U> of the Catellus Disclosure Letter
(such other interests, the &#147;<U>Catellus Joint Ventures</U>&#148;), neither Catellus nor any of the
Catellus Subsidiaries owns any capital stock or other ownership interest in any Person. Neither
Catellus nor any Catellus Subsidiary is in default under any agreement, document or contract
governing its rights in, or obligations to, the Catellus Joint Ventures which default is, or could,
with the passage of time, result in, a breach under such agreement, document or contract, except
for defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Catellus Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Catellus, the other parties to such
agreements, documents and contracts are not in material breach of any of their respective
obligations under such agreements, documents or contracts.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">taxes, have been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent required, have been paid over
to the proper Governmental Entities within the time period prescribed by law. Catellus believes
that the most recent audited financial statements contained in the Catellus SEC Documents filed
with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement reflect an adequate reserve for all material Taxes
payable by Catellus and the Catellus Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof
through the date of such financial statements. Catellus and each Catellus Subsidiary has
established (and until the Closing Date shall continue to establish and maintain) on its books and
records reserves that are adequate for the payment of all material Taxes not yet due and payable.
Catellus has incurred no liability for any material Taxes under Sections&nbsp;857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of
the Code, IRS Notice 88-19, Treasury Regulation&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.337(d)-5, or Treasury Regulation&nbsp;Section
1.337(d)-6 including any material Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section
857(b)(6) of the Code, and neither Catellus nor any of the Catellus Subsidiaries has incurred any
material liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business and other than transfer
or similar Taxes arising in connection with the sales of property. No event has occurred, and no
condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any material Tax will be
imposed upon Catellus or any Catellus Subsidiary pursuant to Sections&nbsp;857 or 4981 of the Code.
Neither Catellus nor any Catellus Subsidiary is the subject of any audit, examination, or other
proceeding in respect of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income Taxes and, to the Knowledge
of Catellus, no audit, examination or other proceeding in respect of U.S. federal, state, local and
foreign income Taxes involving Catellus or any Catellus Subsidiary is being considered by any Tax
authority. No deficiencies for any Taxes have been asserted or assessed in writing (or to the
Knowledge of Catellus or any Catellus Subsidiary, proposed) against Catellus or any of the Catellus
Subsidiaries, including claims by any taxing authority in a jurisdiction where Catellus or any
Catellus Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns but in which any of them is or may be subject to
taxation, which individually or in the aggregate would be material, and no requests for waivers of
the time to assess any such Taxes have been granted and remain in effect or are pending. There are
no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of Catellus or the Catellus Subsidiaries except for statutory
Liens for Taxes not yet due.

investment trust (a &#147;<U>REIT</U>&#148;) within the meaning of the Code and has satisfied the
requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, (B)&nbsp;has operated, and intends to continue to
operate, consistent with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT through the
Effective Time and (C)&nbsp;has not taken or omitted to take any action which could reasonably be
expected to result in the loss of its status as a REIT, and no such challenge is pending, or to
Catellus&#146;s Knowledge, threatened. Each Catellus Subsidiary which is a partnership, joint venture
or limited liability company has since its acquisition by Catellus been classified for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a partnership or treated as a disregarded entity and not as an association
taxable as a corporation, or a &#147;publicly traded partnership&#148; within the meaning of Section 7704(b)
of the Code that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section
7704(a) of the Code. Each Catellus Subsidiary which is a corporation, has since the later of
January&nbsp;1, 2004 or its acquisition by Catellus been a REIT, a qualified REIT subsidiary under
Section 856(i) of the Code or a taxable REIT subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the Code.

&#147;<U>Catellus Intangible Property</U>&#148;), except where the failure to possess or have adequate
rights to use such properties, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Catellus Material Adverse Effect. All of the Catellus Intangible Property is owned or
licensed by Catellus or the Catellus Subsidiaries free and clear of any and all Liens, except those
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Catellus
Material Adverse Effect, and neither Catellus nor any such Catellus Subsidiary has forfeited or
otherwise relinquished any Catellus Intangible Property which forfeiture has resulted in,
individually or in the aggregate, or would reasonably be expected to result in a Catellus Material
Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Catellus, the use of Catellus Intangible Property by Catellus
or the Catellus Subsidiaries does not in any material respect, conflict with, infringe upon,
violate or interfere with or constitute an appropriation of any right, title, interest or goodwill,
including any intellectual property right, trademark, trade name, patent, service mark, brand mark,
brand name, computer program, database, industrial design, copyright or any pending application
therefor, of any other Person, and neither Catellus nor any of the Catellus Subsidiaries has
received any notice of any claim or otherwise knows that any of the Catellus Intangible Property is
invalid or conflicts with the asserted rights of any other Person or has not been used or enforced
or has failed to have been used or enforced in a manner that would result in the abandonment,
cancellation or unenforceability of any of the Catellus Intangible Property, except for any such
conflict, infringement, violation, interference, claim, invalidity, abandonment, cancellation or
unenforceability that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Catellus Material Adverse Effect.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">third party and sales, gross
receipts and use taxes, have been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent required, have been
paid over to the proper Governmental Entities within the time period prescribed by law. ProLogis
believes that the most recent audited financial statements contained in the ProLogis SEC Documents
filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement reflect an adequate reserve for all material
Taxes payable by ProLogis and the ProLogis Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions
thereof through the date of such financial statements. ProLogis and each ProLogis Subsidiary has
established (and until the Closing Date shall continue to establish and maintain) on its books and
records reserves that are adequate for the payment of all material Taxes not yet due and payable.
ProLogis has incurred no liability for any material Taxes under Sections&nbsp;857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of
the Code, IRS Notice 88-19, Treasury Regulation&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.337(d)-5, or Treasury Regulation&nbsp;Section
1.337(d)-6 including any material Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section
857(b)(6) of the Code, and neither ProLogis nor any of the ProLogis Subsidiaries has incurred any
material liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business and other than transfer
or similar Taxes arising in connection with the sales of property. No event has occurred, and no
condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any material Tax will be
imposed upon ProLogis or any ProLogis Subsidiary pursuant to Sections&nbsp;857 or 4981 of the Code.
Neither ProLogis nor any ProLogis Subsidiary is the subject of any audit, examination, or other
proceeding in respect of U.S. federal income Taxes; to the Knowledge of ProLogis, no audit,
examination or other proceeding in respect of U.S. federal income Taxes involving ProLogis or any
ProLogis Subsidiary is being considered by any Tax authority. No deficiencies for any Taxes have
been asserted or assessed in writing (or to the Knowledge of ProLogis or any ProLogis Subsidiary,
proposed) against ProLogis or any of the ProLogis Subsidiaries, including claims by any taxing
authority in a jurisdiction where ProLogis or any ProLogis Subsidiary does
not file Tax Returns but in which any of them is or may be subject to taxation, which
individually or in the aggregate would be material, and no requests for waivers of the time to
assess any such Taxes have been granted and remain in effect or are pending. There are no Liens for
Taxes upon the assets of ProLogis or the ProLogis Subsidiaries except for statutory Liens for Taxes
not yet due.

taken or omitted to take any action which could reasonably be expected to result in the loss of its

ProLogis Subsidiary which is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company has since
the end of the first calendar quarter following its acquisition by ProLogis been classified for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership or treated as a disregarded entity and not as an
association taxable as a corporation, or a &#147;publicly traded partnership&#148; within the meaning of
Section 7704(b) of the Code that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes
under Section 7704(a) of the Code. Each ProLogis Subsidiary which is a corporation has since its
acquisition by ProLogis been a REIT, a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;<U>Employees</U>. Within 45&nbsp;days after the date of this Agreement, ProLogis will notify
Catellus of those Catellus Employees to whom ProLogis, in its sole discretion, will make offers of
continued employment in connection with the Merger (the &#147;<U>Offered Employees</U>&#148;). Subject to
the following provisions of this <U>Section&nbsp;4.8</U>, ProLogis&#146;s offers of continued employment to
the Offered Employees shall be on such terms and conditions as ProLogis determines in its sole
discretion and shall be effective as of and conditioned upon the Closing. Any Offered Employee who
accepts ProLogis&#146;s offer of employment and becomes an employee of ProLogis effective as of the
Closing shall be referred to herein as a &#147;<U>Transferred Employee</U>.&#148; The employment of any
employee of Catellus or the Catellus Subsidiaries who is not a Transferred Employee shall be
terminated by Catellus or the Catellus Subsidiaries, as applicable, prior to the Closing (a
&#147;<U>Non-Transferred Employee</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<U>Severance Agreements</U>. On the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall assume
and honor in accordance with their terms all Catellus Severance Agreements with respect to any
employee of Catellus or the Catellus Subsidiaries (whether or not a Transferred Employee), and the
Surviving Corporation shall not challenge the validity of any obligation of Catellus or any
Catellus Subsidiary under any such Catellus Severance Agreement (whether or not arising before the
Closing Date). Without limiting the foregoing, ProLogis expressly agrees that, with respect to any
employee of Catellus or the Catellus Subsidiaries (whether or not a Transferred Employee) who is a
party to or covered by a Catellus Severance Agreement, the
Merger shall constitute a change of control for purposes of their respective Catellus
Severance Agreements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;<U>Benefit Plans</U>. Following the Closing Date, (i)&nbsp;ProLogis shall provide Transferred
Employees with the same benefits that are provided to other similarly situated employees of
ProLogis from time to time and (ii)&nbsp;solely for purposes of providing health care continuation
coverage under section 4980B of the Code (&#147;<U>COBRA</U>&#148;), ProLogis shall continue to maintain the
Catellus Benefit Plans in effect on the Closing Date until December&nbsp;31, 2006 and shall assume full
responsibility for providing COBRA continuation coverage under such Catellus Benefit Plans through
December&nbsp;31, 2006 to any Non-Transferred Employee or any qualified beneficiary with respect to any
Non-Transferred Employee, in each case who was receiving, had elected or was entitled to elect
COBRA continuation coverage as of the Closing Date. After December&nbsp;31, 2006, any such COBRA
continuation coverage shall be provided to such individuals under ProLogis Benefit Plans. With
respect to any ProLogis Employee Benefit Plan which is an &#147;employee benefit plan&#148; as defined in
Section&nbsp;3(3) of ERISA and any other service based benefits (including vacations) in which
Transferred Employees participate, solely for purposes of determining eligibility to participate,
vesting and entitlement to benefits but not for purposes of accrual of benefits (other than
accruals of vacation, sick or personal time), service with Catellus or any Catellus Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Closing shall be treated for similar purposes as service with ProLogis;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. ProLogis shall (i)&nbsp;waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to Transferred Employees under any welfare
benefit plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees

deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare benefit plans in which such employees

the Effective Time, ProLogis and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, each
director and officer of Catellus or any of the Catellus Subsidiaries (the &#147;<U>Indemnified

the Catellus Subsidiaries as of the date hereof. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this <U>Section&nbsp;4.9</U>, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
demand, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Catellus and, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation, promptly thereof; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the failure to so
notify shall not affect the obligations of Catellus and the Surviving Corporation except to the
extent such failure to notify materially prejudices such party.

limitations of the personal liability of, the trustees, directors and officers of Catellus and the
Catellus Subsidiaries provided for in the Catellus Certificate of Incorporation or Catellus Bylaws,
as in effect as of the date hereof, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time,
including the Merger, shall continue in full force and effect from and after the Effective Time.
Prior to the Effective Time, Catellus shall purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under
Catellus&#146;s existing directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance coverage for Catellus&#146;s directors
and officers, in a form reasonably acceptable to Catellus, which shall provide such directors and
officers with coverage for six years following the Effective Time of not less than the existing

persons than, the directors&#146; and officers&#146; liability insurance coverage presently

advisors and other representatives to cooperate, in all reasonable respects in connection with any
financing efforts (including the refinancing or assumption of existing indebtedness) of ProLogis or
its Affiliates (including providing reasonable assistance in the preparation of one or more
offering circulars, private placement memoranda, registration statements or other offering
documents relating to debt or equity financing) and any other filings that may be made by ProLogis

not less than twenty (20)&nbsp;business days prior to the record date for any quarterly ProLogis
distribution. The foregoing restrictions shall not apply, however, (i)&nbsp;to the extent a
distribution (or an increase in a distribution) by Catellus or ProLogis is necessary for Catellus
or ProLogis, as the case may be, to maintain REIT status, avoid the incurrence of any taxes under
Section&nbsp;857 of the Code, avoid the imposition of any excise taxes under Section&nbsp;4981 of the Code,
or avoid the need to make one or more extraordinary or disproportionately larger distributions to

any dividends previously paid during the tax year that would be expected to give rise to a
dividends paid deduction for such tax year, but before reduction for the dividend contemplated by
this sentence) for the tax year of Catellus ending with the Merger, plus any other amounts

ProLogis) identifying all Persons who, at the time of the Catellus Stockholder Meeting and the
ProLogis Shareholder Meeting, may be deemed to be &#147;affiliates&#148; of Catellus as that term is used in
paragraphs (c)&nbsp;and (d)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;145 under the Securities Act (the &#147;<U>Rule&nbsp;145 Affiliates</U>&#148;).
Catellus shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Person
who is identified as a Rule&nbsp;145 Affiliate in such list to deliver to ProLogis on or prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger a written agreement in the form attached as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;C</U>.
ProLogis shall be entitled to place legends as specified in such written agreements on the

to provide, in lieu of the Merger described herein, either that (i)&nbsp;a new publicly traded holding
company of Catellus and its Subsidiaries (&#147;<U>New Holdco</U>&#148;) shall be created in a transaction
