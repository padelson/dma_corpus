As a condition and inducement to the willingness of ProLogis to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, ProLogis has required the Persons set forth on  _Exhibit A_ (collectively, the " _Specified Holders_ ") to enter into a voting agreement, of even date herewith (the " _Voting Agreements_ "), pursuant to which, among other things, each Specified Holder agrees to vote all shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Catellus (" _Catellus Common Shares_ ") beneficially owned by such Specified Holder in favor of the Merger.   

 C. ProLogis, Catellus and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger.   

 D. It is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and that this Agreement shall constitute a plan of reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

The Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall continue in full force and effect after the Merger as the Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until duly amended in accordance with the respective terms thereof and applicable law.   

 Section 1.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation; Increase in Size of ProLogis Board of Trustees_.   

 (a) The directors of the Surviving Corporation following the Merger shall consist of the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, who shall continue to serve for the balance of their unexpired terms or their earlier death, resignation or removal. The officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.   

 (b) The Board of Trustees of ProLogis shall cause two Catellus Board Designees to become trustees of ProLogis as of, and conditioned upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time, with a term expiring at the annual meeting of shareholders of ProLogis in 2006 or their earlier death, resignation or removal. " _Catellus Board Designees_ " means Nelson C. Rising and one other individual serving as a member of the Board of Directors of Catellus as of the date of this Agreement who is mutually acceptable to ProLogis and Catellus or, if ProLogis and Catellus shall not so agree, who is designated by Catellus in writing prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and reasonably acceptable to ProLogis.   

 Section 1.6 _Conversion of Equity Securities in the Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Catellus, ProLogis, Merger Sub or the holder of any securities of ProLogis, Catellus or Merger Sub:    ##### 

  

  

 (a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ "), of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding and shall be unchanged by the Merger.   

 (b) Each Catellus Common Share that is owned by Catellus, any wholly owned Subsidiary of Catellus, ProLogis or any wholly owned subsidiary of ProLogis immediately prior to the Effective Time and each Catellus Common Share that constitutes a Catellus RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ "), shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto (except for Catellus Common Shares that constitute Catellus RSUs immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shall be treated in accordance with _Section 1.11(b)_).   

 (c) Subject to _Sections 1.7_ and _1.10_ , each Catellus Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall automatically be converted into, and shall be canceled in exchange for, the right to receive, at the option of the holder, as contemplated by and subject to _Section 1.7_, the following:

 (ii) an amount in cash equal to $33.81, without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ ").    

 (d) The Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration and any cash payable in lieu of fractional ProLogis Common Shares pursuant to _Section 1.10_ are referred to collectively as the " _Merger Consideration_." All Catellus Common Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.6(c)_ (other than Dissenting Shares, which shall be treated in accordance with _Section 1.12_, and Excluded Shares, which shall be canceled in accordance with _Section 1.6(b)_) shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Catellus Common Shares (a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such Catellus Common Shares, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be issued in consideration therefor and any dividends or other distributions to which holders of Catellus Common Shares become entitled in accordance with this _Article I_ upon the surrender of such Certificate.   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding ProLogis Common Shares or Catellus Common Shares shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, the Exchange Ratio, the Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly, without duplication, to provide the holders of shares of Catellus Common Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.    ##### 

  

  

 Section 1.7 _Election Procedure_.   

 (a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, ProLogis shall designate EquiServe Shareholder Services or another agent reasonably acceptable to ProLogis and Catellus to act as agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for purposes of conducting the election procedure described in this _Section 1.7_ and the exchange procedure described in _Section 1.8_.   

 (b) ProLogis shall prepare a form of election, which form shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Catellus (the " _Election Form_ ") and shall contain a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates therefore representing Catellus Common Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent), for mailing with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus.   

 (c) The Election Form shall be mailed with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the record holders of Catellus Common Shares as of the record date for the Catellus Stockholders Meeting. Catellus shall also use its commercially reasonable efforts to make the Election Form and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus available to all Persons who become holders of Catellus Common Shares during the period between such record date and the seventh business day prior to the Election Deadline.   

 (d) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or in the case of nominee record holders, the beneficial owner through proper instructions and documentation):   

 (i) to elect to receive the Share Consideration for one or more Catellus Common Shares held by such holder (" _Share Election Shares_ ");    

 (ii) to elect to receive the Cash Consideration for one or more Catellus Common Shares held by such holder (" _Cash Election Shares_ "); and    

 (iii) to indicate that such holder makes no such election with respect to one or more Catellus Common Shares held by such holder (" _Non-Election Shares_ ").    

 (e) Nominee record holders who hold Catellus Common Shares on behalf of multiple beneficial owners shall indicate how many of the Catellus Common Shares held by the nominee will be Share Election Shares, Cash Election Shares or Non-Election Shares, respectively.   

 (f) If a holder of Catellus Common Shares either (i) does not submit a properly completed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline or (ii) revokes an Election Form prior to the Election Deadline and does not resubmit a properly completed Election Form prior to the Election Deadline, the Catellus Common Shares held by such Person shall be treated as Non-Election Shares.   

 (g) Any election to receive the Share Consideration or the Cash Consideration shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the date that is one (1) business day before the date of the Catellus Stockholder Meeting or such other date as ProLogis and Catellus shall mutually agree upon (the " _Election Deadline_ "). An Election Form will be properly completed only if accompanied by Certificates duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form    ##### 

  

    

acceptable for transfer on the books of the Company (or accompanied by an
appropriate guarantee of delivery of such Certificates, provided such
Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent within three (3) New
York Stock Exchange trading days after the date of execution of such
guarantee of delivery) representing all Catellus Common Shares covered
thereby. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the Person submitting
such Election Form to the Exchange Agent by written notice to the Exchange
Agent only if such written notice is actually received by the Exchange Agent
prior to the Election Deadline. In addition, all Election Forms shall be
deemed to be automatically revoked if this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Article VII_. Any Certificate or Certificates representing
Catellus Common Shares relating to any revoked Election Form shall be
promptly returned without charge to the Person submitting the Election
Form to the Exchange Agent.   

 (h) ProLogis shall have reasonable discretion to determine, which it may delegate in whole or in part to the Exchange Agent, when any election, modification or revocation is received and whether any such election, modification or revocation has been properly made and to disregard immaterial defects in any Election Form, and any good faith decisions of ProLogis (or the Exchange Agent) regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of the parties to this Agreement or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in an Election Form submitted to the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall make all computations contemplated by this _Section 1.7_ and all such computations shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of Catellus Common Shares.   

 (i) By the later of (x) the Effective Time and (y) seven (7) days after the Election Deadline, the Exchange Agent shall effect an allocation of the Share Consideration and the Cash Consideration in accordance with the Election Forms as follows:   

 (i) If the number of Cash Election Shares times the Cash Consideration is less than the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then:    

 (A) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration;   

 (B) Non-Election Shares shall be deemed to be Cash Election Shares to the extent necessary to have the total number of Cash Election Shares times the Cash Consideration equal the Aggregate Cash Consideration. If less than all of the Non-Election Shares need to be treated as Cash Election Shares in order to have the total number of Cash Election Shares times the Cash Consideration equal the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then the Exchange Agent shall select which Non-Election Shares shall be treated as Cash Election Shares in accordance with _Section 1.7(j)_, and all remaining Non-Election Shares shall thereafter be treated as Share Election Shares;   

 (C) if the total number of Cash Election Shares (including any Non-Election Shares treated as such) times the Cash Consideration remains less than the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then the Exchange Agent shall convert (on a pro rata basis as described in _Section 1.7(j)_) a sufficient number of Share Election Shares into Cash Election Shares (" _Reallocated Cash Shares_ ") such that the sum of the number of Cash Election Shares (including any Non-Election Shares treated as such) plus the number of Reallocated Cash Shares times the    ##### 

  

  

Cash Consideration equals the Aggregate Cash Consideration, and all
Reallocated Cash Shares will be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration; and    

 (D) the Share Election Shares which are not Reallocated Cash Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration.   

 (ii) If the number of Cash Election Shares times the Cash Consideration is greater than the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then:    

 (A) all Share Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration;   

 (B) the Exchange Agent shall convert (on a pro rata basis as described in _Section 1.7(j)_ ) a sufficient number of Cash Election Shares into Share Election Shares (" _Reallocated Stock Shares_ ") such that the number of remaining Cash Election Shares times the Cash Consideration equals the Aggregate Cash Consideration, and all Reallocated Stock Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration; and   

 (C) the Cash Election Shares which are not Reallocated Stock Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.   

 (iii) If the number of Cash Election Shares times the Cash Consideration is equal to the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then _Sections 1.7(i)(i)_ and _1.7(i)(ii)_ shall not apply and (A) all Non-Election Shares and all Share Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Share Consideration and (B) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.    

 (j) In the event that the Exchange Agent is required pursuant to _Section 1.7(i)(i)(C)_ to convert some Share Election Shares into Reallocated Cash Shares, such conversion shall be allocated on a pro rata basis among the Share Election Shares. In the event the Exchange Agent is required pursuant to _Section 1.7(i)(ii)(B)_ to convert some Cash Election Shares into Reallocated Stock Shares, such conversion shall be allocated on a pro rata basis among the Cash Election Shares. In the event the Exchange Agent is required pursuant to _Section 1.7(i)(i)(B)_ to convert some Non-Election Shares into Cash Election Shares or Share Election Shares, such conversion shall be allocated on a pro rata basis among Non-Election Shares.   

 Section 1.8 _Exchange Procedure_.   

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, ProLogis shall deliver to the Exchange Agent (i) certificates representing ProLogis Common Shares sufficient to deliver the aggregate Share Consideration and (ii) the Aggregate Cash Consideration payable pursuant to this _Article I_ and cash from time to time as required to make payment in lieu of any fractional shares of ProLogis Common Shares (collectively, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). If at any time after the Effective Time, the Exchange Fund is insufficient to pay the Merger Consideration, then ProLogis shall immediately deposit cash or additional ProLogis Common Shares, as applicable, in an amount equal to such deficiency. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the ProLogis Common Shares held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or other    ##### 

  

    

distributions paid or distributed with respect to such ProLogis Common Shares
for the account of the Persons entitled thereto.   

 (b) After completion of the allocation contemplated by _Section 1.7(i)_, each holder of an outstanding Certificate or Certificates who has surrendered such Certificate or Certificates to the Exchange Agent shall, upon acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive (i) a certificate or certificates representing the number of whole ProLogis Common Shares into which the aggregate number of Share Election Shares previously represented by such Certificate or Certificates surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares, (iii) the amount of cash which the aggregate number of Cash Election Shares previously represented by such Certificate or Certificates surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement and (iv) the aggregate amount of any distributions declared but unpaid as of the Effective Time with respect to the Catellus Common Shares represented by such Certificate or Certificates or declared and paid after the Effective Time on the ProLogis Common Shares into which the aggregate number of Share Election Shares previously represented by such Certificate or Certificates surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without interest. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. Each outstanding Certificate that prior to the Effective Time represented Catellus Common Shares and which is not surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the procedures provided for herein shall, except as otherwise herein provided, until duly surrendered to the Exchange Agent, be deemed to evidence the right to receive the Share Consideration or the right to receive the Cash Consideration into which such Catellus Common Shares shall have been converted. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of Catellus or the Surviving Corporation of Certificates representing Catellus Common Shares, and if such Certificates are presented to ProLogis or the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled against delivery of certificates for the Share Consideration or the Cash Consideration, or both, as hereinabove provided. No dividends on ProLogis Common Shares that are declared after the Effective Time shall be remitted to any Person entitled to receive ProLogis Common Shares under this Agreement until such Person surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing Catellus Common Shares, at which time such dividends shall be remitted to such Person (assuming such dividends are payable on or prior to the date on which such Certificate or Certificates are surrendered), without interest. In the case of the Certificates representing Dissenting Shares, each Certificate representing Dissenting Shares shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time for all purposes to represent only the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL.   

 (c) Appropriate transmittal materials in a form satisfactory to ProLogis and Catellus (including a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of such certificate to the Exchange Agent) shall be mailed as soon as practicable after the Effective Time to each holder of record of  Catellus Common Shares as of the Effective Time who did not previously submit a properly completed Election Form. ProLogis shall not be obligated to deliver cash and/or a certificate or certificates representing ProLogis Common Shares to which a holder of Catellus Common Shares would otherwise be entitled as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing Catellus Common Shares for exchange as provided in this    ##### 

  

  

 _Section 1.8_, or, in lieu thereof, an appropriate affidavit of loss and
indemnity agreement and/or a bond as may be required by ProLogis or the
Exchange Agent. If any certificates evidencing ProLogis Common Shares are to
be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate evidencing
Catellus Common Shares surrendered in exchange therefor is registered,
it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of
assignment separate from the Certificate and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other tax required by reason of the issuance of a
certificate for ProLogis Common Shares in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or otherwise establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
payable.    

 (d) Any portion of the Share Consideration or Cash Consideration delivered to the Exchange Agent by ProLogis pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Catellus for one year after the Effective Time (as well as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to ProLogis. Any shareholders of Catellus who have not theretofore complied with _Section 1.7_ or _1.8_ shall thereafter look only to ProLogis for the consideration deliverable in respect of each Catellus Common Share such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of Catellus Common Shares represented by any Certificate for any consideration paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. The parties to this Agreement and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of Catellus to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto.   

 Section 1.9 _Rights as Shareholders; Share Transfers_. At the Effective Time, holders of Catellus Common Shares shall cease to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of Catellus other than to receive the Merger Consideration provided under this _Article I_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Catellus or the Surviving Corporation of shares of Catellus Common Shares.   

 Section 1.10 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for a fractional ProLogis Common Share shall be issued in connection with the Merger. Each holder of Catellus Common Shares who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a ProLogis Common Share (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying (x) the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by (y) the average closing price of a ProLogis Common Share on the New York Stock Exchange on the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time (as reported in the Wall Street Journal, or if not reported therein, in another authoritative source), rounded to the nearest whole cent. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify ProLogis, and ProLogis shall deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional share interests subject to and in accordance with the terms of _Section 1.8_. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share.    ##### 

  

  

 Section 1.11 _Share Options; Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units_.   

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Catellus shall take all actions necessary and appropriate, or in the case of options granted under the 1991 Plan, 1995 Plan and Executive Stock Option Plan, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary consents of holders of such options, to provide that, as of the Effective Time, each then outstanding option to purchase Catellus Common Shares (" _Catellus Option_ ") under any employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of Catellus (the " _Catellus Stock Option Plans_ ") whether or not exercisable and vested at the Effective Time shall be canceled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such canceled Catellus Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of such cancellation, an amount equal to the Option Consideration subject to applicable tax withholding. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Option Consideration_ " with respect to a Catellus Option means an amount equal to the product of (x) the total number of Catellus Common Shares subject to such Catellus Option immediately prior to its cancellation and (y) the excess, if any, of (i) $33.81 over (ii) the exercise price per share subject to such Catellus Option. The " _Net Option Payment_ " is the Option Consideration reduced by such aggregate amount as is required to be withheld with respect to the Option Consideration under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. Each former holder of any canceled Catellus Option shall receive the Net Option Payment in the form of (i) a number of ProLogis Common Shares equal to 65% of the Net Option Payment (based on the closing price of a ProLogis Common Share on the last business day immediately prior to the Closing Date) and (ii) an amount of cash equal to 35% of the Net Option Payment. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, ProLogis shall provide each holder of Catellus Options that are canceled pursuant to this _Section 1.11(a)_ with a payment as described in this _Section 1.11(a)_, and any such canceled Catellus Options shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment described in this _Section 1.11(a)_. By virtue of the foregoing treatment of the Catellus Options, the parties agree that no Person shall have any right under or with respect to any Catellus Option after the Effective Time other than the right to receive the applicable payment (if any) due pursuant to this _Section 1.11(a)_.   

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Catellus shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to provide that, as of the Effective Time, each restricted stock award and each restricted stock unit award (including all restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance unit awards granted pursuant to Catelluss Long-Term Incentive Plan and Catelluss Transition Incentive Plan, director stock units and restricted director stock units) (the " _Catellus RSUs_ ") granted under the Catellus Stock Option Plans whether or not vested at the Effective Time shall be canceled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such canceled Catellus RSU shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of such cancellation, an amount equal to the RSU Consideration subject to applicable tax withholding. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _RSU Consideration_ " means with respect to a Catellus RSU an amount equal to the product of (x) the total number of Catellus Common Shares subject to such Catellus RSU immediately prior to its cancellation and (y) $33.81. The " _Net RSU Payment_ " is the RSU Consideration reduced by such aggregate amount as is required to be withheld with respect to the RSU Consideration under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. Each former holder of any canceled Catellus RSU shall receive a Net RSU Payment in the form of (i) a number of ProLogis Common Shares equal to 65% of the Net RSU Payment (based on the closing price of a ProLogis Common Share on the last business day immediately prior to the Closing Date) and    ##### 

  

  

(ii) an amount of cash equal to 35% of the Net RSU Payment. As soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, ProLogis shall provide each holder
of Catellus RSUs that are canceled pursuant to this _Section 1.11(b)_ with a
payment as described in this _Section 1.11(b)_, and any such canceled
Catellus RSU shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof,
but shall only entitle such holder to the payment described in this _Section
1.11(b)_. By virtue of the foregoing treatment of the Catellus RSUs, the
parties agree that no Person shall have any right under or with respect to
any Catellus RSU after the Effective Time other than the right to receive the
applicable payment (if any) due pursuant to this _Section 1.11(b)_.    

 (c) As of the Effective Time, the Catellus Stock Option Plans shall be terminated and no further awards or grants shall be made thereunder.   

 Section 1.12 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Catellus Common Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by holders who have not voted in favor of the approval of this Agreement and the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who have properly demanded appraisal for such Catellus Common Shares in accordance with the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 1.6_ , but shall represent and become the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due such holders pursuant to the Laws of the State of Delaware, unless and until any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses its right to appraisal, such holders Catellus Common Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive, upon surrender as provided above, the Cash Consideration, without any interest, and such Catellus Common Shares shall no longer be Dissenting Shares. Catellus shall give ProLogis prompt notice of any demands received by Catellus for appraisal of Catellus Common Shares, and ProLogis shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of ProLogis or as may otherwise be required by applicable Law, Catellus shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.   

 Section 1.13 _Tax Treatment_. The parties intend, that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement shall constitute a plan of reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.   

 Section 1.14 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Exchange Agent, ProLogis and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this _Article I_ such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, ProLogis or the Surviving Corporation so withholds or deducts any amount, such amount shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Catellus Common Shares, Catellus Options or Catellus RSUs in respect of which the Exchange Agent, ProLogis or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, made such deduction or withholding.    ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE II 
  _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES_     

 Section 2.1 _Representations and Warranties of Catellus_. Catellus represents and warrants to ProLogis and Merger Sub as follows:   

 (a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power of Catellus_. Catellus is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. Catellus is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business it is conducting, or the ownership, operation or leasing of its properties or the management of properties for others makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, would not have, or would not be reasonably expected to have, a Catellus Material Adverse Effect. " _Catellus Material Adverse Effect_ " means (x) a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of Catellus and the Catellus Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) the effect of preventing or materially delaying the performance by Catellus of any of its obligations under this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Catellus Material Adverse Effect shall not include any change with respect to Catellus or any Catellus Subsidiary to the extent resulting from or attributable to (i) any change in general national or international economic, financial or political conditions or events, including the effects of terrorist acts that do not result in the destruction or material physical damage of a material portion of Catelluss real properties, (ii) the announcement, pendency or consummation of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or (iii) any change in conditions generally affecting the securities markets or the industry in which Catellus and the Catellus Subsidiaries operate that does not affect Catellus or any Catellus Subsidiary to a materially greater extent than such change affects other Persons in the industry in which Catellus and the Catellus Subsidiaries operate. Catellus has heretofore made available to ProLogis complete and correct copies of the Catellus Certificate of Incorporation, as amended and supplemented to the date hereof, and the Catellus By-laws, as amended to the date hereof.

Catellus Subsidiary.   

 (g) _No Undisclosed Material Liabilities_. Except as disclosed in the Catellus SEC Documents, as set forth in _Schedule 2.1(g)_ of the Catellus Disclosure Letter or as otherwise would not reasonably be expected to have a Catellus Material Adverse Effect, there are no liabilities of Catellus or any of the Catellus Subsidiaries or Catellus Joint Ventures, whether accrued, contingent, absolute or determined, and, to Catelluss Knowledge, there is no existing condition, situation or set of circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in such a liability, other than: (i) liabilities adequately provided for on the balance sheet of Catellus dated as of December 31, 2004 (including the notes thereto); (ii) liabilities adequately provided for on the balance sheets of the Catellus Joint Ventures dated as of December 31, 2004; or (iii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business subsequent to December 31, 2004.  _Schedule 2.1(g)_ of the Catellus Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete list of all material loan or credit agreements, notes, bonds, mortgages, indentures and other agreements and instruments existing at the date of this Agreement pursuant to which any material indebtedness of Catellus, any Catellus Subsidiary or, to Catelluss Knowledge, any Catellus Joint Venture is outstanding or may be incurred and the respective principal amounts outstanding thereunder as of May 31, 2005.   

 (h) _No Default_. None of Catellus, any of the Catellus Subsidiaries or, to Catelluss Knowledge, any of the Catellus Joint Ventures is in default or violation (and no event has occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or violation) of any term, condition or provision of (i) the Catellus Certificate of Incorporation or the Catellus By-laws or the comparable charter or organizational documents of any of the Catellus Subsidiaries or Catellus Joint Ventures, (ii) any loan or credit agreement, note, or any bond, mortgage or indenture, to which Catellus or any of the Catellus Subsidiaries or any Catellus Joint Venture is a party or by which Catellus, any of the Catellus Subsidiaries, any Catellus Joint Venture or any of their respective properties or assets is bound, or (iii) any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Catellus, any of the Catellus Subsidiaries or any of the Catellus Joint Ventures, except in the case of (ii) and (iii) for defaults    ##### 

  

    

or violations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Catellus Material Adverse Effect.   

 (i) _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. Catellus, the Catellus Subsidiaries and, to Catelluss Knowledge, the Catellus Joint Ventures hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the " _Catellus Permits_ "), except where the failure so to hold such Catellus Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Catellus Material Adverse Effect. Catellus and the Catellus Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Catellus Permits, except where the failure to so comply, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Catellus Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in the Catellus SEC Documents, the businesses of Catellus and the Catellus Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of any Law, except for violations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Catellus Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the Catellus SEC Documents, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Catellus, any Catellus Subsidiary or, to Catelluss Knowledge, any Catellus Joint Venture is pending or, to Catelluss Knowledge, threatened, other than those the outcome of which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Catellus Material Adverse Effect.   

 (j) _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in the Catellus SEC Documents or as set forth in  _Schedule 2.1(j)_ of the Catellus Disclosure Letter and except for routine litigation arising from the ordinary course of business of Catellus, the Catellus Subsidiaries and the Catellus Joint Ventures which are adequately covered by insurance, there is no suit, action or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Catellus, threatened against Catellus, any Catellus Subsidiary or, to Catelluss Knowledge, any Catellus Joint Venture or any of their respective properties or assets that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Catellus Material Adverse Effect.   

 (k) _Taxes_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.1(k)_ of the Catellus Disclosure Letter:   

 (i) Each of Catellus and the Catellus Subsidiaries has timely filed all material Tax Returns required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity having authority to do so). Catellus and each Catellus Subsidiary has paid (or Catellus has paid on its behalf), all material Taxes that are shown as due and payable on such Tax Returns. True, correct and complete copies of all U.S. federal, state and local Tax Returns for Catellus and each Catellus Subsidiary with respect to tax years commencing on or after January 1, 1999, and all written communications with any Tax authority relating to such Tax Returns, have been delivered or made available to ProLogis or representatives of ProLogis. In addition, all written communications with any Tax authority requested by ProLogis or its representatives have been delivered or made available to representatives of ProLogis. With respect to Tax years commencing on or after January 1, 1999 and other open years, all transactions and Tax positions with material Tax consequences to Catellus or any Catellus Subsidiary have been disclosed to ProLogis or its representatives. All material Taxes which Catellus or the Catellus Subsidiaries are required by Law to withhold or collect, including Taxes required to have been withheld in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party and sales, gross receipts and use     ##### 

  

     

taxes, have been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent required, have
been paid over to the proper Governmental Entities within the time period
prescribed by law. Catellus believes that the most recent audited financial
statements contained in the Catellus SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior
to the date of this Agreement reflect an adequate reserve for all material
Taxes payable by Catellus and the Catellus Subsidiaries for all taxable
periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial statements.
Catellus and each Catellus Subsidiary has established (and until the Closing
Date shall continue to establish and maintain) on its books and records
reserves that are adequate for the payment of all material Taxes not yet due
and payable. Catellus has incurred no liability for any material Taxes under
Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, IRS Notice 88-19, Treasury
Regulation Section 1.337(d)-5, or Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-6
including any material Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in
Section 857(b)(6) of the Code, and neither Catellus nor any of the Catellus
Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the
ordinary course of business and other than transfer or similar Taxes arising
in connection with the sales of property. No event has occurred, and
no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any
material Tax will be imposed upon Catellus or any Catellus Subsidiary
pursuant to Sections 857 or 4981 of the Code. Neither Catellus nor any
Catellus Subsidiary is the subject of any audit, examination, or
other proceeding in respect of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income
Taxes and, to the Knowledge of Catellus, no audit, examination or other
proceeding in respect of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income Taxes
involving Catellus or any Catellus Subsidiary is being considered by any
Tax authority. No deficiencies for any Taxes have been asserted or assessed
in writing (or to the Knowledge of Catellus or any Catellus Subsidiary,
proposed) against Catellus or any of the Catellus Subsidiaries, including
claims by any taxing authority in a jurisdiction where Catellus or
any Catellus Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns but in which any of them is
or may be subject to taxation, which individually or in the aggregate would
be material, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes
have been granted and remain in effect or are pending. There are no Liens for
Taxes upon the assets of Catellus or the Catellus Subsidiaries except for
statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due.    

 (ii) Catellus (A) for each taxable year beginning with its taxable year ended on December 31, 2004 and ending at the Effective Time, has been subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust (a " _REIT_ ") within the meaning of the Code and has satisfied the requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, (B) has operated, and intends to continue to operate, consistent with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT through the Effective Time and (C) has not taken or omitted to take any action which could reasonably be expected to result in the loss of its status as a REIT, and no such challenge is pending, or to Catelluss Knowledge, threatened. Each Catellus Subsidiary which is a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company has since its acquisition by Catellus been classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership or treated as a disregarded entity and not as an association taxable as a corporation, or a "publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 7704(a) of the Code. Each Catellus Subsidiary which is a corporation, has since the later of January 1, 2004 or its acquisition by Catellus been a REIT, a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code or a taxable REIT subsidiary under Section 856(l) of the Code.     ##### 

  

     

 (iii) As of the date of this Agreement, Catellus does not have any earnings and profits attributable to Catellus or any other corporation in any non-REIT year within the meaning of Section 857 of the Code.    

 (iv) None of Catellus, any of the Catellus Subsidiaries or any of the Catellus Joint Ventures is (i) subject, directly or indirectly, to any Tax Protection Agreement or (ii) in violation of or in default under any Tax Protection Agreement.    

 (v) To Catelluss Knowledge, as of the date hereof, Catellus is a "domestically-controlled qualified investment entity" within the meaning of Section 897(h) of the Code.    

 (vi) Neither Catellus nor any Catellus Subsidiary is a party to any Tax allocation or sharing agreement.    

 (vii) Catellus does not have any liability for the Taxes of any person other than Catellus and the Catellus Subsidiaries, and the Catellus Subsidiaries do not have any liability for the Taxes of any person other than Catellus and the Catellus Subsidiaries (A) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), (B) as a transferee or successor, (C) by contract or (D) otherwise.    

 (l) _Pension and Benefit Plans; ERISA_.   

 (i) Except as set forth in _Schedule 2.1(l)(i)_ of the Catellus Disclosure Letter, all "employee pension benefit plans," as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), maintained or contributed to by Catellus or any of the Catellus Subsidiaries or any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which is under common control, or which is treated as a single employer, with Catellus under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (a " _Catellus ERISA Affiliate_ ") (the " _Catellus Pension Plans_ ") intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code have been determined by the IRS to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (or have been timely submitted to the IRS for such determination), no such determination has been modified, revoked or limited and each such determination covers all amendments to each such plan for which the remedial amendment period has expired.

ProLogis Material Adverse Effect. All of the ProLogis Intangible Property is
owned or licensed by ProLogis or the ProLogis Subsidiaries free and clear of
any and all Liens, except those that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a ProLogis Material Adverse Effect, and
neither ProLogis nor any such ProLogis Subsidiary has forfeited or otherwise
relinquished any ProLogis Intangible Property which forfeiture has resulted

result in a ProLogis Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of ProLogis,
the use of ProLogis Intangible Property by ProLogis or the ProLogis
Subsidiaries does not in any material respect, conflict with, infringe
upon, violate or interfere with or constitute an appropriation of any right,
title, interest or goodwill, including any intellectual property right,
trademark, trade name, patent, service mark, brand mark, brand name, computer
program, database, industrial design, copyright or any pending
application therefor, of any other Person, and neither ProLogis nor any of
the ProLogis Subsidiaries has received any notice of any claim or otherwise
knows that any of the ProLogis Intangible Property is invalid or conflicts
with the asserted rights of any other Person or has not been used or

result in the abandonment, cancellation or unenforceability of any of the
ProLogis Intangible Property, except for any such conflict, infringement,
violation, interference, claim, invalidity, abandonment, cancellation
or unenforceability that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a ProLogis Material Adverse Effect.

 (i) None of ProLogis, or the ProLogis Subsidiaries or the ProLogis Joint Ventures has received written notice that any complaint has been filed that remains unresolved, any penalty has been assessed that has not been paid and any investigation or review is pending or threatened by any Governmental Entity with respect to any alleged failure by ProLogis, or any ProLogis Subsidiary or any ProLogis Joint Venture to have any permit required under any applicable Environmental Law or with respect to any treatment, storage, recycling, transportation, disposal or Release by ProLogis, or any ProLogis Subsidiary or any ProLogis Joint Venture of any Hazardous Material in material violation of any Environmental Law.

the time of the issuance of each such policy, and no material claim has been
made against any such policy that has not been resolved.

To ProLogiss Knowledge, neither ProLogis nor any of the ProLogis Subsidiaries has received any written notice of cancellation or termination (excluding cancellation upon expiration or failure to renew) with respect to any existing material insurance policy of ProLogis or any of the ProLogis Subsidiaries.

 (s) _Investment Company Act of 1940_. Neither ProLogis nor any of the ProLogis Subsidiaries is, or at the Effective Time will be, required to be registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.   

 (t) _Contracts_. The ProLogis SEC Documents list all ProLogis Material Contracts. Except as set forth in the ProLogis SEC Documents, each ProLogis Material Contract is valid, binding and enforceable and in full force and effect against ProLogis (if it is a party thereto) and each ProLogis Subsidiary that is a party thereto and, to ProLogiss Knowledge, each other party thereto, except where such failure to be so valid, binding and enforceable and in full force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a ProLogis Material Adverse Effect. None of ProLogis (if it is a party thereto) or any ProLogis Subsidiary that is a party thereto is in default under a ProLogis Material Contract and, to ProLogiss Knowledge, no other party to any ProLogis Material Contract is in default thereunder, except for such defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a ProLogis Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _ProLogis Material Contracts_ " means any agreements required to be filed as exhibits to the ProLogis SEC Documents pursuant to Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of Title 17, Part 229 of the Code of Federal Regulations, except for agreements required to be filed by Item 601(b)(10)(iii) thereof.   

 (u) _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be available to shareholders of ProLogis or Merger Sub with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

 (v) _State Takeover Statutes; Charter Waiver_. ProLogis has taken all action necessary to exempt the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from operation of any Takeover Statute. ProLogis and the ProLogis Board of Trustees have taken all appropriate and necessary actions to waive or remove, or to exempt Catellus and its beneficial owners from triggering, any and all limitations on ownership of ProLogis Common Shares contained in ProLogis Declaration of Trust or By-laws by reason of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

 (w) _Taxes_. Except as set forth in the ProLogis SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement:   

 (i) Each of ProLogis and the ProLogis Subsidiaries has timely filed all material Tax Returns required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Entity having authority to do so). Each such Tax Return is accurate and complete in all material respects. ProLogis and each ProLogis Subsidiary has paid (or ProLogis has paid on its behalf), all material Taxes that are shown as due and payable on such Tax Returns. All material Taxes which ProLogis or the ProLogis Subsidiaries are required by Law to withhold or collect, including Taxes required to have been withheld in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or other      ##### 

  

     

third party and sales, gross receipts and use taxes, have been duly withheld
or collected and, to the extent required, have been paid over to the proper
Governmental Entities within the time period prescribed by law.
ProLogis believes that the most recent audited financial statements contained
in the ProLogis SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date of this
Agreement reflect an adequate reserve for all material Taxes payable by
ProLogis and the ProLogis Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and
portions thereof through the date of such financial statements. ProLogis and
each ProLogis Subsidiary has established (and until the Closing Date shall
continue to establish and maintain) on its books and records reserves that
are adequate for the payment of all material Taxes not yet due and
payable. ProLogis has incurred no liability for any material Taxes under
Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, IRS Notice 88-19, Treasury
Regulation Section 1.337(d)-5, or Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-6
including any material Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in
Section 857(b)(6) of the Code, and neither ProLogis nor any of the ProLogis
Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the
ordinary course of business and other than transfer or similar Taxes arising
in connection with the sales of property. No event has occurred, and
no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a material risk that any
material Tax will be imposed upon ProLogis or any ProLogis Subsidiary
pursuant to Sections 857 or 4981 of the Code. Neither ProLogis nor any
ProLogis Subsidiary is the subject of any audit, examination, or
other proceeding in respect of U.S. federal income Taxes; to the Knowledge of
ProLogis, no audit, examination or other proceeding in respect of U.S.
federal income Taxes involving ProLogis or any ProLogis Subsidiary is being
considered by any Tax authority. No deficiencies for any Taxes have been
asserted or assessed in writing (or to the Knowledge of ProLogis or any
ProLogis Subsidiary, proposed) against ProLogis or any of the ProLogis
Subsidiaries, including claims by any taxing authority in a jurisdiction
where ProLogis or any ProLogis Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns but in
which any of them is or may be subject to taxation, which individually or in
the aggregate would be material, and no requests for waivers of the time
to assess any such Taxes have been granted and remain in effect or are
pending. There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of ProLogis or the

 (b) Catellus shall notify ProLogis in writing (as promptly as practicable but in any event within 24 hours of receipt) of the relevant details relating to all inquiries and proposals (including the identity of the parties, price and other terms thereof) which it or any of the Catellus Subsidiaries or any such officer, trustee, director, employee, agent, investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant, broker, finder or other representative or Affiliate may receive after the date hereof relating to any of such matters and shall promptly inform ProLogis in writing with respect to any such inquiry or proposal that becomes reasonably likely to lead to    ##### 

  

  

a proposal for a Competing Transaction, regardless of whether or not such
proposal is likely to lead to a Superior Competing Transaction.    

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Competing Transaction_ " means any of the following (other than the transactions expressly provided for in this Agreement): (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving Catellus (or any of the material Catellus Subsidiaries); (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition of 15% or more of the assets of Catellus and the Catellus Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or series of related transactions; or (iii) any tender offer or exchange offer for 15% or more of the voting power in the election of directors exercisable by the holders of outstanding equity securities of Catellus (or any of the material Catellus Subsidiaries).   

 (d) For all purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Competing Transaction_ " means a bona fide written proposal made by a third party for a Competing Transaction (i) on terms which a majority of the Catellus Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors of nationally recognized reputation, are superior to Catelluss stockholders to those provided for in the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account all financial and strategic considerations and other relevant factors, including relevant legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposals, and the conditions, contingencies, prospects and time required for and likelihood of completion of such proposal, in each case that are deemed relevant by the Catellus Board of Directors in good faith), and (ii) that was not solicited, encouraged or facilitated by Catellus or its Affiliates or any of their respective advisors in breach of this _Section 4.5_.   

 Section 4.6 _Public Announcements_. Catellus and ProLogis shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public statement as may be required by Law or the rules of any applicable stock exchange if it has used its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party. In this regard, the parties shall make a joint public announcement of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement no later than (i) the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the day this Agreement is signed, if such signing occurs during a business day and before the close of trading, or (ii) the opening of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the business day following the date on which this Agreement is signed, if such signing does not occur during a business day or occurs after the close of trading.   

 Section 4.7 _Transfer and Gains Taxes_. ProLogis shall, with Catelluss good faith cooperation and assistance, prepare, execute and file, or cause to be prepared, executed and filed, all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer and stamp Taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar Taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (together, with any related interest, penalties or additions to Tax, " _Transfer and Gains Taxes_ ").    ##### 

  

  

 Section 4.8 _Employee Arrangements_.   

 (a) _Employees_. Within 45 days after the date of this Agreement, ProLogis will notify Catellus of those Catellus Employees to whom ProLogis, in its sole discretion, will make offers of continued employment in connection with the Merger (the " _Offered Employees_ "). Subject to the following provisions of this _Section 4.8_, ProLogiss offers of continued employment to the Offered Employees shall be on such terms and conditions as ProLogis determines in its sole discretion and shall be effective as of and conditioned upon the Closing. Any Offered Employee who accepts ProLogiss offer of employment and becomes an employee of ProLogis effective as of the Closing shall be referred to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_." The employment of any employee of Catellus or the Catellus Subsidiaries who is not a Transferred Employee shall be terminated by Catellus or the Catellus Subsidiaries, as applicable, prior to the Closing (a " _Non-Transferred Employee_ ").   

 (b) _Severance Agreements_. On the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall assume and honor in accordance with their terms all Catellus Severance Agreements with respect to any employee of Catellus or the Catellus Subsidiaries (whether or not a Transferred Employee), and the Surviving Corporation shall not challenge the validity of any obligation of Catellus or any Catellus Subsidiary under any such Catellus Severance Agreement (whether or not arising before the Closing Date). Without limiting the foregoing, ProLogis expressly agrees that, with respect to any employee of Catellus or the Catellus Subsidiaries (whether or not a Transferred Employee) who is a party to or covered by a Catellus Severance Agreement, the Merger shall constitute a change of control for purposes of their respective Catellus Severance Agreements.   

 (c) _Benefit Plans_. Following the Closing Date, (i) ProLogis shall provide Transferred Employees with the same benefits that are provided to other similarly situated employees of ProLogis from time to time and (ii) solely for purposes of providing health care continuation coverage under section 4980B of the Code (" _COBRA_ "), ProLogis shall continue to maintain the Catellus Benefit Plans in effect on the Closing Date until December 31, 2006 and shall assume full responsibility for providing COBRA continuation coverage under such Catellus Benefit Plans through December 31, 2006 to any Non-Transferred Employee or any qualified beneficiary with respect to any Non-Transferred Employee, in each case who was receiving, had elected or was entitled to elect COBRA continuation coverage as of the Closing Date. After December 31, 2006, any such COBRA continuation coverage shall be provided to such individuals under ProLogis Benefit Plans. With respect to any ProLogis Employee Benefit Plan which is an "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA and any other service based benefits (including vacations) in which Transferred Employees participate, solely for purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits but not for purposes of accrual of benefits (other than accruals of vacation, sick or personal time), service with Catellus or any Catellus Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing shall be treated for similar purposes as service with ProLogis;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. ProLogis shall (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Transferred Employees under any welfare benefit plans in which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees    ##### 

  

  

and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any welfare
benefit plan maintained for the Transferred Employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Transferred Employee with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time under a
corresponding Catellus Employee Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any welfare benefit
plans in which such employees are eligible to participate after the Effective
Time as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the plans and arrangements maintained by ProLogis. Transferred
Employees shall retain all vacation days (including personal choice days and
floating holidays) and sick days accrued as of the Effective Time. Non-
Transferred Employees shall receive a cash payment for all vacation days
(including personal choice days and floating holidays) and sick days accrued
as of the Effective Time.    

 (d) _2005 Annual Bonuses_. Following the Closing Date, ProLogis shall pay (or cause to be paid) each Transferred Employee their annual bonuses for 2005 in the amounts determined by Catellus immediately prior to the Closing Date at the earlier of (i) February 28, 2006 and (ii) the date that such Transferred Employee ceases to be employed by ProLogis or its Subsidiaries. Non-Transferred Employees shall be paid their annual bonuses for 2005 in the amounts determined by Catellus prior to the Closing Date at the earlier of (i) the date that the applicable Non-Transferred Employee ceases to be employed by Catellus and (ii) the Closing Date. In no event shall the aggregate amount of annual bonuses for 2005 to Catellus employees exceed the amount of the annual bonus pool for 2005 set forth on _Schedule 2.1(f)_ of the Catellus Disclosure Letter.   

 Section 4.9 _Indemnification; Trustees  and Officers Insurance_.   

 (a) It is understood and agreed that Catellus shall indemnify and hold harmless, and, after the Effective Time, ProLogis and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, each director and officer of Catellus or any of the Catellus Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), as and to the same extent as such Indemnified Parties are indemnified by Catellus or the Catellus Subsidiaries as of the date hereof. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section 4.9_, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Catellus and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, promptly thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of Catellus and the Surviving Corporation except to the extent such failure to notify materially prejudices such party.   

 (b) ProLogis agrees that all rights to indemnification existing in favor of, and all limitations of the personal liability of, the trustees, directors and officers of Catellus and the Catellus Subsidiaries provided for in the Catellus Certificate of Incorporation or Catellus Bylaws, as in effect as of the date hereof, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, including the Merger, shall continue in full force and effect from and after the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, Catellus shall purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under Catelluss existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage for Catelluss directors and officers, in a form reasonably acceptable to Catellus, which shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six years following the Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not materially less favorable on the whole to the insured persons than, the directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently    ##### 

  

  

maintained by Catellus, so long as such endorsement is available for an
aggregate cost of not more than 300% of the existing annual premium (the "
_Maximum Premium Amount_ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if such
endorsement is not available for no more than the Maximum Premium Amount then
Catellus shall purchase an endorsement in an amount and scope as great as can
be obtained for the Maximum Premium Amount; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
Catellus shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to acquire such
endorsement at the lowest available cost from responsible insurers.    

 (c) This _Section 4.9_ is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Catellus and the Surviving Corporation. Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this _Section 4.9_.   

 (d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person or entity, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 4.9_.   

 Section 4.10 _Assistance_. From and after the date of this Agreement, if ProLogis requests, Catellus and the Catellus Subsidiaries shall cooperate, and shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause Catelluss attorneys, accountants, investment bankers and financial advisors and other representatives to cooperate, in all reasonable respects in connection with any financing efforts (including the refinancing or assumption of existing indebtedness) of ProLogis or its Affiliates (including providing reasonable assistance in the preparation of one or more offering circulars, private placement memoranda, registration statements or other offering documents relating to debt or equity financing) and any other filings that may be made by ProLogis or its Affiliates, including, if applicable, with the SEC, all at the sole expense of ProLogis (or its Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , that Catellus shall not be required to take any action with respect to the financing if such action requires the approval of the Catellus Board of Directors. Catellus shall reasonably cooperate with ProLogis in obtaining surveys, title commitments, engineering reports, existing environmental reports or policies and appraisals with respect to the Catellus Properties (it being understood that such activities shall be conducted at ProLogiss expense).   

 Section 4.11 _Proxy Solicitor_. Catellus and ProLogis shall each engage a nationally recognized proxy solicitor to assist in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating to the Catellus Stockholder Approval and the ProLogis Shareholder Approval.   

 Section 4.12 _Resignations_. Upon the written request of ProLogis, (i) Catellus shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain resignations from or, in lieu thereof, Catellus shall cause the removal of, any or all of the directors (or persons occupying similar positions in any limited liability company or other entity) and/or officers of each Catellus Subsidiary, effective as of the Closing, and (ii) if Catellus or any of its affiliated entities has the right to appoint any director (or person occupying a similar position in any limited liability company or other entity) or to cause the resignation or termination of any officer of any other entity in which Catellus    ##### 

  

  

(directly or indirectly) owns an equity interest, Catellus use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain resignations or, in lieu thereof, Catellus shall
cause the removal of, effective as of the Closing, such director and/or such
officer.    

 Section 4.13 _Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance_. Catellus shall continue its existing and planned efforts to comply in all material respects with all applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder, including preparing and maintaining appropriate controls, procedures and documentation to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Item 308 of Regulation S-K promulgated thereunder.   

 Section 4.14 _Listing of ProLogis Common Shares_. ProLogis shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the ProLogis Common Shares to be issued as part of the Merger Consideration to be approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance.   

 Section 4.15 _Declaration of Dividends_.   

 (a) From and after the date of this Agreement, neither Catellus nor ProLogis shall make any dividend or distribution to its respective shareholders without the prior written consent of the other party; _provided_ , _however_ , the written consent of the other party shall not be required for the authorization and payment of (i) distributions at their respective stated dividend or distribution rates with respect to ProLogis Preferred Shares, (ii) quarterly distributions with respect to the Catellus Common Shares of up to $0.27 per share for the quarter ending September 30, 2005 and each quarter thereafter and (iii) quarterly distributions with respect to the ProLogis Common Shares of up to $0.37 per share for the quarter ending September 30, 2005 and for each quarter thereafter; _provided_ , _however_ , the record date for each distribution with respect to the Catellus Common Shares shall be the same date as the record date for the quarterly distribution for the ProLogis Common Shares, as provided to Catellus by notice not less than twenty (20) business days prior to the record date for any quarterly ProLogis distribution. The foregoing restrictions shall not apply, however, (i) to the extent a distribution (or an increase in a distribution) by Catellus or ProLogis is necessary for Catellus or ProLogis, as the case may be, to maintain REIT status, avoid the incurrence of any taxes under Section 857 of the Code, avoid the imposition of any excise taxes under Section 4981 of the Code, or avoid the need to make one or more extraordinary or disproportionately larger distributions to meet any of the three preceding objectives, (ii) to ProLogis with respect to any Corresponding ProLogis Dividend or (iii) to Catellus with respect to any Catellus Dividend.   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to the Closing Date, Catellus shall declare and pay a dividend to its stockholders (the " _Catellus Dividend_ "), the record date and payment date for which shall be the close of business on the last business day prior to the Closing Date, distributing cash in an amount equal to its estimated "real estate investment trust taxable income" (as such term is used in Section 857(a) of the Code and reflecting any dividends previously paid during the tax year that would be expected to give rise to a dividends paid deduction for such tax year, but before reduction for the dividend contemplated by this sentence) for the tax year of Catellus ending with the Merger, plus any other amounts determined by Catellus (in consultation with ProLogis) to be required to be    ##### 

  

  

distributed in order for Catellus to qualify as a REIT for such tax year and
to avoid to the extent reasonably possible the incurrence of income or excise
Tax by Catellus.    

 (c) If Catellus determines that it is necessary to declare a Catellus Dividend, Catellus shall notify ProLogis at least 20 days prior to the date for the Catellus Stockholders Meeting, and ProLogis shall be entitled to declare a dividend per share payable to holders of ProLogis Common Shares, the record date for which shall be the close of business on the last business day prior to the Effective Time, in an amount per ProLogis Common Share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the Catellus Dividend with respect to each Catellus Common Share by (y) 0.822 (the " _Corresponding ProLogis Dividend_ "). If, and to the extent, the terms of any series of ProLogis Preferred Shares require the payment of a dividend by reason of the payment of the Corresponding ProLogis Dividend, ProLogis shall declare and pay any such required dividends and distributions.   

 Section 4.16 _Affiliates_. Prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, Catellus shall cause to be prepared and delivered to ProLogis a list (reasonably satisfactory to counsel for ProLogis) identifying all Persons who, at the time of the Catellus Stockholder Meeting and the ProLogis Shareholder Meeting, may be deemed to be "affiliates" of Catellus as that term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the " _Rule 145 Affiliates_"). Catellus shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Person who is identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate in such list to deliver to ProLogis on or prior to the Effective Time of the Merger a written agreement in the form attached as _Exhibit C_. ProLogis shall be entitled to place legends as specified in such written agreements on the certificates representing any ProLogis Common Shares to be received pursuant to the terms of this Agreement by such Rule 145 Affiliates who have executed such agreements and to issue appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for the ProLogis Common Shares issued to such Rule 145 Affiliates, consistent with the terms of such agreements.   

 Section 4.17 _Change of Structure_. Upon the request of ProLogis prior to the date that the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first mailed to Catellus Stockholders or ProLogis Shareholders, the parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to amend this Agreement to provide, in lieu of the Merger described herein, either that (i) a new publicly traded holding company of Catellus and its Subsidiaries (" _New Holdco_ ") shall be created in a transaction qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the Code and, thereafter, New Holdco shall merge with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub as the surviving corporation of the merger, or (ii) Catellus shall be merged with and into ProLogis, with ProLogis as the surviving entity in the merger. All other terms and conditions of this Agreement as so amended shall remain, to the extent practicable, the same as provided in this Agreement on the date hereof.
