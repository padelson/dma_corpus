 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **THE OFFER**

 



 

Section 1.1. _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and provided that this Agreement shall not have been
terminated pursuant to _Article IX_ and that the Company shall have complied
with its obligations under this _Section 1.1_ and _Section 1.2_, as promptly
as practicable after the date hereof (but in no event more than twenty (20)
business days thereafter), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act) the Offer. In the Offer, each Company Share accepted by Purchaser in
accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer shall be
exchanged for the right to receive, at the election of the holder: (i) $15.85
in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), (ii) 1.5226 shares of Parent Common
Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ "), or (iii) $5.55 in cash and 0.9894
shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Mixed Consideration_ ") (each of the
Cash Consideration, Stock Consideration and Mixed Consideration, as
applicable, the " _Offer Consideration_ "), in each case subject to proration
as set forth in _Section 1.1(c)_ and the other provisions of this _Article
I_. The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that is

 



      
 

 



 

disseminated to all of the holders of Company Shares as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act. The Offer to Purchase will contain the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in _Annex B_. Each of Parent and
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Offer,
subject to the terms and conditions hereof and thereof. The Offer shall be
subject only to:

 



 

(i) the condition that, prior to the expiration of the Offer, there being
validly tendered (excluding Company Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed
delivery procedures that have not yet been "received" by the depositary for
the Offer) and not validly withdrawn in accordance with the terms of the Offer
a number of Company Shares that, together with the Company Shares then owned
by Parent and Purchaser (if any), represents one (1) Company Share more than
two-thirds (66 2/3%) of all then-outstanding Company Shares (the " _Minimum
Condition_ "); and

 



 

(ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex B_.

 



 

(b) Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive or modify any of the
conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of, or conditions
to, the Offer; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything to the contrary set forth herein, without the prior written consent
of the Company, Purchaser may not (and Parent shall not permit Purchaser to)
(i) waive any of the conditions set forth in clauses (A), (B), (C), (D),
(E)(5)(ii), (E)(6)(i), (G)(1), (G)(2) or (G)(3) of _Annex B_ ( _provided_ that
Parent shall (and shall cause Purchaser to) waive any of the conditions set
forth in clauses (E)(5)(ii), (E)(6)(i), (G)(1), (G)(2) or (G)(3) of _Annex B_
upon the written request of the Company), or (ii) make any change in the terms
of or conditions to the Offer that (A) changes the form of consideration to be
paid in the Offer, (B) decreases the consideration in the Offer or the number
of Company Shares sought in the Offer (unless an appropriate adjustment is
made pursuant to _Section 1.1(d)_), (C) extends the Offer, other than in a
manner required or permitted by the provisions of _Section 1.1(e)_, (D)
imposes conditions to the Offer other than those set forth in _Annex B_ , or
(E) amends or modifies any other term of, or condition to, the Offer in any
manner that is adverse to the holders of Company Shares.

 



 

(c) _Elections; Proration; Fractional Shares_.

 



 

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 1.1(c)_, each holder of
Company Shares validly tendered in the Offer shall be entitled to elect (1)
the number of Company Shares which such holder desires to exchange for the
right to receive the Mixed Consideration (a " _Mixed Election_ ," and such
shares, the " _Mixed Election Shares_ "), (2) the number of Company Shares
which such holder desires to exchange for the right to receive the Cash
Consideration (a " _Cash Election_ ," and such shares, the " _Cash Election
Shares_ "), and (3) the number of Company Shares which such holder desires to
exchange for the right to receive the Stock Consideration (a " _Stock
Election_ ," and such shares, the " _Stock Election Shares_ "). Any Cash
Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election shall be referred to herein as an "
_Election_ ," and shall be made on a form for that purpose prepared by Parent
that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (a " _Form of Election in
Offer_"), included as part of the letter(s) of election and transmittal
accompanying the Offer. Holders of record of Company Shares who hold such

 



      
 

 



 

Company Shares as nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities may
submit multiple Forms of Election in Offer on behalf of their respective
beneficial holders.

 



 

(ii) Any Election pursuant to the Offer shall have been properly made only if
the depositary for the Offer shall have actually received a properly completed
Form of Election in Offer by the expiration date of the Offer. Any Form of
Election in Offer may be revoked or changed by the authorized Person properly
submitting such Form of Election in Offer, by written notice received by the
depositary for the Offer prior to the expiration date of the Offer. In the
event an Election is revoked prior to the expiration date of the Offer, the
Company Shares represented by such Form of Election in Offer shall become
Mixed Election Shares (to the extent such Company Shares remain tendered in
the Offer and are not validly withdrawn from the Offer), except to the extent
a subsequent election is properly made with respect to any or all of such
Company Shares prior to expiration date of the Offer. Subject to the terms of
this Agreement and of the Form of Election in Offer, the depositary for the
Offer shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether any election,
revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard
immaterial defects in any Form of Election in Offers, and any good-faith
decisions of the depositary for the Offer regarding such matters shall be
binding and conclusive. None of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the
depositary for the Offer shall be under any obligation to notify any Person of
any defect in a Form of Election in Offer.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the
Cash Elections and the Stock Elections shall be subject to proration as
described in this _Section 1.1(c)_.

 



 

(1) The maximum number of Company Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn in the Offer which shall be eligible to receive the Cash
Consideration shall equal 35.0% of the aggregate number of Company Shares
tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) (excluding Mixed Election
Shares and No Election Shares) (the " _Maximum Cash Shares in Offer_ ").

 



 

(2) If the total number of Cash Election Shares validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn in the Offer exceeds the Maximum Cash Shares in Offer, such
Cash Elections shall be subject to proration as follows: for each such Cash
Election, the number of Company Shares that shall be exchanged for the right
to receive the Cash Consideration shall be (A) the total number of Cash
Election Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer
multiplied by (B) the Offer Cash Proration Factor, rounded down to the nearest
Company Share. The " _Offer Cash Proration Factor_ " means a fraction (x) the
numerator of which shall be the Maximum Cash Shares in Offer and (y) the
denominator of which shall be the total number of Cash Election Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer. The Cash Election Shares validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer that are not exchanged for the
right to receive the Cash Consideration in accordance with this _Section
1.1(c)(iii)(2)_ shall instead be exchanged for the right to receive the Stock
Consideration.

 



 

(3) The maximum number of Company Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn in the Offer which shall be eligible to receive the Stock
Consideration shall equal 65.0% of the aggregate number of Company Shares
tendered in the

 



      
 

 



 

Offer (and not validly withdrawn) (excluding Mixed Election Shares and No
Election Shares) (the " _Maximum Stock Shares in Offer_ ").

 



 

(4) If the total number of Stock Election Shares validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn in the Offer exceeds the Maximum Stock Shares in Offer, such
Stock Elections shall be subject to proration as follows: for each such Stock
Election, the number of Company Shares that shall be exchanged for the right
to receive the Stock Consideration shall be (A) the total number of Stock
Election Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer
multiplied by (B) the Offer Stock Proration Factor, rounded down to the
nearest Company Share. The " _Offer Stock Proration Factor_ " means a fraction
(x) the numerator of which shall be the Maximum Stock Shares in Offer and (y)
the denominator of which shall be the total number of Stock Election Shares
validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer. The Stock Election Shares
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Offer that are not exchanged
for the right to receive the Stock Consideration in accordance with this
_Section 1.1(c)(iii)(4)_ shall instead be exchanged for the right to receive
the Cash Consideration.

 



 

(iv) All prorations resulting from either _Section 1.1(c)(iii)(2)_ or
_Section 1.1(c)(iii)(4)_ shall be applied on a pro rata basis, such that each
holder of Company Shares who validly tenders Cash Election Shares or Stock
Election Shares, as applicable, bears its proportionate share of the
proration, based on a percentage of the total Cash Election Shares or Stock
Election Shares, as applicable, validly tendered in the Offer (and not validly
withdrawn) by such holder of Company Shares bears to all Cash Election Shares
or Stock Election Shares, as applicable, validly tendered in the Offer (and
not validly withdrawn) by all holders of Company Shares.

 



 

(v) Each Company Share validly tendered into the Offer (and not validly
withdrawn) but which is not the subject of a valid Election (a " _No Election
Share_ ") received prior to the expiration of the Offer shall be deemed to be
a Mixed Election Share. In no event shall any Mixed Election Shares or No
Election Shares be subject to proration pursuant to _Section 1.1(c)(iii)(2)_
or _Section 1.1(c)(iii)(4)_.

 



 

(vi) In lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock that otherwise
would be issuable pursuant to the Offer, each holder of Company Shares who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer (after aggregating all Company Shares validly
tendered in the Offer (and not validly withdrawn) by such holder) will be paid
an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such fractional part of a share
of Parent Common Stock _multiplied by_ the Parent Trading Price, rounded to
the nearest cent.

 



 

(d) _Adjustments to the Offer_. The Mixed Consideration, the Cash
Consideration, the Stock Consideration, the Maximum Cash Shares in Offer, the

recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to the number of Company Shares or shares of Parent

the date hereof and prior to Purchasers acceptance for payment of, and

the terms of this Agreement.

(i) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this

any period required by any Law, or any rule, regulation, interpretation or

applicable to the Offer or the Merger, or to the extent necessary to resolve
any comments of the SEC or its staff applicable to the Offer or the Offer
Documents or the Form S-4;

 



 

(B) in the event that any of the conditions to the Offer (other than the
Minimum Condition) have not been satisfied or waived as of any then-scheduled
expiration of the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
extend the Offer for one or more consecutive increments of not more than ten
(10) business days each (or for such longer period as may be agreed by the
Company) in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions to the Offer
(for the avoidance of doubt, other than the Minimum Condition);

 



 

(C) if as of any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer each condition to the
Offer (other than the Minimum Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived
and the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied, Purchaser may, and,
at the written request of the Company, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to), extend the Offer for one or more consecutive increments of not
more than ten (10) business days each (or for such longer period as may be
agreed by the Company); _provided_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be
required to extend the expiration date of the Offer more than two (2) times
pursuant to this clause (C); and

 



 

(D) Purchaser may extend the Offer for any period necessary to satisfy the
notice requirements contained in Section 3-106.1(e)(1) of the MGCL (the "
_Maryland Short Form Merger Notice_");

 



 

 _provided, however_ , that (1) any such extension shall not be deemed to
impair, limit, or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Parties to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms of _Article IX_ (subject, in
the case of _Section 9.1(h)_, to Purchasers rights and obligations to

 



      
 

 



 

extend the Offer pursuant to this _Section 1.1(e)(ii)_), and (2) Purchaser
shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date.

"subsequent offering period" (within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated

with the provisions of _Section 1.1(e)(ii)_ without the prior written consent
of the Company.

 



 

(iv) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior
to the then-scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this Agreement is validly
terminated in accordance with _Article IX_, in which case Purchaser shall
(and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer promptly (but in no event more than one (1) business day)
after such termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(f) _Payment for Company Shares_. On the terms of and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company
Shares that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer promptly (within the meaning of Section 14e-1(c) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) after the expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in
accordance with _Section 1.1(e)(ii)_) (or, at Parents election, concurrently
with the expiration of the Offer if all conditions to the Offer have been
satisfied or waived) (such time of acceptance, the " _Acceptance Time_ ").
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide or
cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds and shares of
Parent Common Stock necessary to pay for any Company Shares that Purchaser
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer; _provided, however,_ that
without the prior written consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not accept
for payment, or pay for, any Company Shares if, as a result, Purchaser would
acquire less than the number of Company Shares necessary to satisfy the
Minimum Condition. The consideration in the Offer payable in respect of each
Company Share validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash or shares of Parent Common
Stock, as applicable, without interest and subject to reduction for any
applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof. The Company shall
register (and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its transfer

securities of the Company or of Purchaser, subject to any applicable
withholding Tax, each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Shares) shall be automatically
converted into the right to receive, without interest, at the election of the
holder: (i) the Cash Consideration, (ii) the Stock Consideration, or (iii) the
Mixed Consideration (in each case, the " _Common Merger Consideration_ "), in
each case subject to proration as set forth in _Section 3.1(e)_ and the other
provisions of this _Article III_. From and after the Effective Time, all such
Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of such Company
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the applicable portion of Common Merger Consideration therefor upon
the surrender of such Company Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2_,
including the right to receive, pursuant to _Section 3.6_, cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, if any, into which such Company
Shares have been converted pursuant to this _Section 3.1(a)_ (the "
_Fractional Share Consideration_ "), together with the amounts, if any,
payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(f)_.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Certain Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each
Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is owned by Parent or Purchaser (including Company Shares accepted for
payment by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer) shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor
(collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ").

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Purchaser Shares_. At the Effective Time, each issued and
outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Purchaser
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding as shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) _Treatment of Company Preferred Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of
any securities of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company or of Purchaser, subject to any applicable withholding Tax, each share
of the Companys 7.625% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.001
par value per share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ " or such shares, the "
_Company Preferred Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive one
newly issued share of Parent Series E Preferred Stock (the " _Preferred Merger
Consideration_ "), subject to the provisions of this _Article III_. From and
after the Effective Time, all such Company Preferred Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each applicable holder of such Company Preferred Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Preferred
Merger Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Company Preferred
Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2_.

 



 

(e) _Elections; Proration_.

 



 

(i) Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 3.1(e)_, each holder of
Company Shares as of immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger
(other than Cancelled Shares) shall be entitled to elect (1) a number of Cash
Election Shares, (2) a number of Stock Election Shares, and (3) a number of
Mixed Election Shares. Any Cash Election, Stock Election or Mixed Election
shall be made on a form for that purpose prepared by Parent that is reasonably
acceptable to the Company (a " _Form of Election in Merger_"), which shall be
mailed to such holders of Company Shares promptly after the Closing Date (such
date, the " _Mailing Date_ "). The deadline for submitting an effective,
properly completed Form of Election in Merger to the Exchange Agent shall be
5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the 20th day following the Mailing Date (or such
other time and date as the Parties may mutually agree) (the " _Election
Deadline_ "). Holders of record of Company Shares who hold such Company Shares
as nominees, trustees or in other representative capacities may submit
multiple Forms of Election in Merger on behalf of their respective beneficial
holders.

 



 

(ii) Any election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent
shall have actually received a properly completed Form of Election in Merger
by the Election Deadline. Any Form of Election in Merger may be revoked or
changed by the authorized Person properly submitting such Form of Election in
Merger, by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election
Deadline. In the event a Form of Election in Merger is revoked prior to the
Election Deadline, the Company Shares represented by such Form of Election in
Merger shall become Mixed Election Shares, except to the extent a subsequent
election is properly made with respect to any or all of such Company Shares
prior to the Election Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of
the Form of Election in Merger, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change has been
properly or timely made and to disregard immaterial defects in any Form of
Election in Merger, and any good-faith decisions of the Exchange Agent
regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. None of Parent,
Purchaser, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to
notify any Person of any defect in a Form of Election in Merger.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the
Cash Election Shares and Stock Election Shares eligible to receive Common
Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ shall be subject to proration as
described in this _Section 3.1(e)_.

 



 

(1) The maximum number of Company Shares which shall be eligible to receive
the Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ shall equal 35.0% of the
aggregate number of Company Shares entitled to receive Common Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ (excluding Mixed Election Shares
and No Election Shares) (the " _Maximum Cash Shares in Merger_ ").

 



 

(2) If the total number of Cash Election Shares eligible to receive Common
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ exceeds the Maximum Cash
Shares in Merger, such Cash Elections shall be subject to proration as
follows: For each such Cash Election, the number of Company Shares that shall
be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration shall be (A) the
total number of Cash Election Shares eligible to receive Common Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ multiplied by (B) the Merger Cash
Proration Factor, rounded down to the nearest Company Share. The " _Merger
Cash Proration Factor_ " means a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be
the Maximum Cash Shares in Merger and (y) the denominator of which shall be
the aggregate number of Cash Election Shares eligible to receive Common Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_. The Cash Election Shares that
were not converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in
accordance with this _Section 3.1(e)(iii)(2)_ shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration.

 



 

(3) The maximum number of Company Shares which shall be eligible to receive
the Stock Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ shall equal 65.0% of the
aggregate number of Company Shares entitled to receive Common Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ (excluding Mixed Election Shares
and No Election Shares) (the " _Maximum Stock Shares in Merger_ ").

 



 

(4) If the total number of Stock Election Shares eligible to receive Common
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ exceeds the Maximum Stock
Shares in Merger, such Stock Elections shall be subject to proration as
follows: For each such Stock Election, the number of Company Shares that shall
be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration shall be (A)
the total number of Stock Election Shares eligible to receive Common Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ multiplied by (B) the Merger Stock
Proration Factor, rounded down to the nearest Company Share. The " _Merger
Stock Proration Factor_ " means a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be
the Maximum Stock Shares in Merger and (y) the denominator of which shall be
the aggregate number of Stock Election Shares eligible to receive Common
Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_. The Stock Election Shares
that were not converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in
accordance with this _Section 3.1(e)(iii)(4)_ shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration.

 



 

(iv) All prorations resulting from either _Section 3.1(c)(iii)(2)_ or
_Section 3.1(c)(iii)(4)_ shall be applied on a pro rata basis, such that each
holder of Company Shares bears its proportionate share of the proration, based
on a percentage of the total Cash Election Shares or Stock Election Shares, as
applicable, elected by such holder of Company Shares bears to all

 



      
 

 



 

Cash Election Shares or Stock Election Shares, as applicable, elected by
holders of Company Shares in the Merger.

 



 

(v) Each Company Share eligible to receive the Common Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ for which an election shall not have been
properly made by the Election Deadline shall be deemed to be a Mixed Election
Share and shall only be entitled to the right to receive the Mixed
Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.1(a)_. In no event shall any
Mixed Election Shares be subject to proration pursuant to _Section
3.1(e)(iii)(2)_ or _Section 3.1(e)(iii)(4)_.

 



 

(f) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration, Maximum
Cash Shares in Merger, Merger Cash Proration Factor and Merger Stock Proration
Factor shall be adjusted appropriately, without duplication, to reflect the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or other distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock, Company Preferred Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the number of Company Shares,
Company Preferred Shares or shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this _Section
3.1(f)_ shall be construed to permit the Company or Parent to take any action
with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.2. _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall
designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as the exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_
"). The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the holders of Company
Shares and Company Preferred Shares for the purpose of receiving and holding
their Form of Election in Merger, Certificates and Book­Entry Shares and shall
obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented thereby. At or
immediately after the Effective Time, Parent or Purchaser shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) evidence of Parent Common
Stock and Parent Series E Preferred Stock issuable pursuant to _Section
3.1(a)_ and _Section 3.1(d)_, respectively, in book­entry form equal to the
aggregate Parent Common Stock portion of the Common Merger Consideration
(excluding any Fractional Share Consideration) and the aggregate Preferred
Merger Consideration, respectively, and (ii) cash in immediately available
funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends under _Section
3.2(f)_ (such evidence of book­entry shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent
Series E Preferred Stock and cash amounts, together with any dividends or
other distributions with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), in each
case, for the sole benefit of the holders of Company Shares and Company
Preferred Shares. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient (other
than as a result of payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with
this Agreement) to pay the aggregate cash portion of the Merger Consideration,
Fractional Share Consideration and any dividends under _Section 3.2(f)_,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly deposit,
or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an
amount which is equal to the shortfall that is required to make such payment.
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to

 



      
 

 



 

make, and the Exchange Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger Consideration,
including payment of the Fractional Share Consideration, and any amounts
payable in respect of dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_ out of the Exchange Fund in
accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion
of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably
directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash
shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-
term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A­1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Certificates or Book­Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article III_. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the
Surviving Corporation on the earlier of (A) one (1) year after the Effective
Time or (B) the full payment of the Exchange Fund.

 



 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and make available for collection by
hand) to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Shares
or Company Preferred Shares, as applicable (the " _Certificates_ "), or
non­certificated Company Shares or Company Preferred Shares, as applicable,
represented by book­entry (" _Book ­Entry Shares_") and whose Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, were converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_
into the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration (i) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent, an indemnity bond) to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (it being
understood that the forms of Letter of Transmittal to be mailed to the holders
of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock may vary in certain
respects due to differences in the respective securities) and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) or
Book­Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration into which such Company Shares or Company Preferred Shares, as
applicable, have been converted pursuant to _Section 3.1_, including any
amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with
_Section 3.6_, and any dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent, an indemnity bond) or Book­Entry Share for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of transmittal duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate or Book­Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article III_, any Fractional Share Consideration that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section
3.6_, and any amounts that such holder has the right to receive in respect of
dividends or

 



      
 

 



 

other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with
_Section 3.2(f)_ for each Company Share formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book­Entry Share, to be mailed (or made available for
collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder) within five (5)
business days following the later to occur of (x) the Election Deadline and
the determination of proration pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_ or (y) the
Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity bond) or Book­Entry Share,
and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by
Parent, an indemnity bond) or Book­Entry Share so surrendered shall be
forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, an indemnity
bond) or Book­Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and
conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange
thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, at Parents election, Parent may instruct the Exchange
Agent to automatically convert Book-Entry Shares into the applicable Merger
Consideration without any required action on the part of the holders of such
Book-Entry Shares. If payment of the applicable Merger Consideration is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that
(A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the applicable Merger Consideration to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid
or is not required to be paid. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect to Book­Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book­Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this _Section 3.2_, each Certificate and Book­Entry Share shall be deemed
at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
the applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Article III_,
including any amount payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in
accordance with _Section 3.6_, and any dividends or other distributions on
shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_, in each
case without interest thereon.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares or Company
Preferred Shares_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration
of transfers of Company Shares or Company Preferred Shares on the records of
the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares or Company
Preferred Shares, as applicable, except as otherwise provided for herein. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book­Entry Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the
first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not
been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the
Exchange Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of Certificates
or Book­Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look
only to

 



      
 

 



 

the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat
or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the
applicable Merger Consideration, including any amount payable in respect of
Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.6_, and any
dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_, payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates or Book­Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in
_Section 3.2(b)_, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book­Entry Share for any
Merger Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required
by Parent, an indemnity bond, the applicable Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to _Section 3.1_ hereof, including any amount
payable in respect of Fractional Share Consideration in accordance with
_Section 3.6_, and any dividends or other distributions on shares of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with _Section 3.2(f)_.

 



 

(f) _Dividends or Other Distributions with Respect to Parent Common Stock_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book­Entry Share with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder (for the avoidance of doubt, only with
respect to the Common Merger Consideration), and all such dividends and other
distributions shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such
Certificate or Book­Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in
accordance with this Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate or Book­Entry Share (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof) there shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, (i)
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) at
the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and
with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

Section 3.3. _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Merger or the other Transactions.

 



 

Section 3.4. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Vested RSA shall, without any action on the
part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be cancelled, with the
holder of such Vested RSA becoming entitled to receive, in full satisfaction
of the rights of such holder with respect thereto, the Mixed Consideration in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested RSA
immediately prior to the Effective Time, less applicable Tax withholdings. The
applicable Taxes required to be withheld shall first reduce the cash portion
of the aggregate

 



      
 

 



 

Mixed Consideration to be received by a holder of Vested RSAs in respect of
such Vested RSAs and, if the cash portion of the aggregate Mixed Consideration
is not sufficient to satisfy such Taxes, any shortfall shall be satisfied by
reducing the stock portion of the aggregate Mixed Consideration to be received
by a holder of Vested RSAs in respect of such Vested RSAs, with the value of
the stock portion for purposes of such deduction determined based on the
Parent Trading Price. Any holder of a Vested RSA who becomes entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all
shares represented by all Company RSAs held by such individual) shall receive,
in lieu thereof, cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional
part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Parent Trading Price,
less any applicable Tax withholding, payable in accordance with _Section
3.4(d)_.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, each Rollover RSA shall, without any action on the
part of Parent, the Company or the holder thereof, be assumed and converted
automatically into a restricted stock award (each, a " _Converted RSA_ ") with
respect to a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Rollover RSA immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded to the nearest
whole share. Each Converted RSA shall vest in accordance with the terms of the
consulting agreement between each holder of Converted RSAs and Parent dated as
of the date hereof and shall otherwise have the same terms and conditions of
the corresponding Rollover RSA.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors (or the
appropriate committee(s) thereof) shall pass resolutions as are necessary for
the treatment of the Company Equity Awards as contemplated by this _Section
3.4_.

 



 

(d) The Parties will coordinate to cause any cash payments required pursuant
to this _Section 3.4_ to be made through the applicable payroll system no
later than twenty-one (21) days after the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 3.5. _Withholding_. Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts as are required to
be withheld or deducted with respect to such payment under the Code, or any
other applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld and remitted to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 



 

Section 3.6. _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or Book­Entry Shares, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of Company Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after aggregating all shares represented by the Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof,
cash, without interest, in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share
of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Parent Trading Price.

issued to the holders of the Company Preferred Stock pursuant to _Section
3.1(d)_ are as set forth in the articles supplementary in the form set forth

Section 4.3. _Corporate Authority_.

 



 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions, including the Offer
and the Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by the
Company Board of Directors and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company are necessary to authorize the consummation of, and to consummate,
the Transactions, except, with respect to the Merger, for the filing of the
Articles of Merger with and acceptance for record of the Articles of Merger by
the Maryland Department. On or prior to the date hereof, at a meeting duly
called and held, the Company Board of Directors, acting upon the unanimous
recommendation of the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Special Committee, has unanimously (i) determined that the terms of the Offer,
the Merger and the other Transactions are fair to, and in the best interests
of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii) declared the Offer, the Merger and
the other Transactions advisable, (iii) approved the execution and delivery by
the Company of this Agreement, the performance by the Company of its covenants
and agreements contained herein and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger
and the other Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions
contained herein, and (iv) resolved to recommend that the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock accept the Offer and tender their shares of Company
Common Stock to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer. As of the date hereof, none
of the foregoing actions by the Company Board of Directors have been rescinded

Series E Preferred Stock to be issued to the holders of the Company Preferred
Stock pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ are as set forth in the articles
supplementary in the form set forth in _Annex C_ , no vote of the holders of

is necessary to adopt this Agreement and consummate the Merger or other
Transactions under applicable Law and the Company Governing Documents.

 



 

(c) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
agreement of Parent and Purchaser, constitutes the valid and binding agreement

except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, examinership, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws,
now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights generally and (ii)

Section 4.10. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) _Section 4.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth each
material Company Benefit Plan. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Company

deferred compensation, retirement or supplemental retirement, severance,
employment, change-in­control, collective bargaining, profit sharing, pension,
vacation, cafeteria, dependent care, medical care, employee assistance
program, education or tuition assistance programs, and each insurance and
other similar fringe or employee benefit plan, policy, program, agreement or
arrangement, in each case, for the benefit of current employees,

 



      
 

 



 

directors or consultants (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof) of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their ERISA Affiliates or with
respect to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any obligation or
liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Benefit Plans shall not
include any plans that both (x) do not cover current or former employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (y) are sponsored or maintained by
Atlantic Capital Advisors, LLC or any of its ERISA Affiliates; _provided
further_ , _however_ , that the Parties agree that neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed an ERISA Affiliate of Atlantic Capital

Subsidiaries taken as a whole has been incurred by the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates that has not been

material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole
thereunder. Except as would not result in a material liability to the Company,
all contributions or other amounts payable by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries pursuant to each Company Benefit Plan in respect of current or
prior plan years have been timely paid or accrued in accordance with GAAP or
applicable international accounting standards. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction in connection with which the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries could be subject to either a civil penalty
assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant
to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code. There are no pending, or to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened or anticipated claims, actions, investigations or
audits (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of or against
any of the Company Benefit Plans or any trusts related thereto that would
reasonably be expected to result in a material liability.

or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, (ii) is a "multiemployer plan" (as such

termination of service, other than coverage mandated by the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, or comparable U.S.
state Law.

within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter or opinion letter as to its qualification, and (ii) to
the knowledge of the Company there are no existing circumstances or any events
that have occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any such plan. Each such favorable determination letter
has been provided or made available to Parent.

 



 

(f) Except as provided under _Section 3.4_, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions (either
alone or in conjunction with any other event) will (i) entitle to compensation
or any benefit or result in any payment (including severance, unemployment
compensation, "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code), forgiveness of Indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due to any
current or former director or any employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary under any Company Benefit Plan, (ii) increase any compensation,
equity award or any other benefits otherwise payable under any Company Benefit
Plan, (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment, funding or
vesting of any such compensation, equity award or other benefits or trigger
any other material obligation under any Company Benefit Plan, or (iv) result
in any breach or violation of, or default under or limit the Companys right
to amend, modify, terminate or transfer the assets of, any Company Benefit
Plan.

 



 

(g) Each Company Benefit Plan has been maintained and operated in documentary

additional Taxes payable pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

a significant role in Parents internal controls over financial reporting.

any material liability for any other Taxes other than (x) in the ordinary
course of business or consistent with past practice, or (y) transfer or
similar Taxes arising in connection with acquisitions or dispositions of

the Company Board of Directors) shall not, and shall cause each Company
Subsidiary and Representative not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,

cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees and other Representatives (including the Company Manager)
to, immediately cease any and all existing discussions or negotiations with
any parties (or provision of any non-public information to any parties)
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential
Acquisition Proposal. Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall
request that each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or a potential Acquisition
Proposal promptly destroy or return to the Company all non-public information
relating to such Acquisition Proposal or to the Company or its businesses or
assets heretofore furnished by the Company or any of its Representatives to
such Person or group or any of its representatives in accordance with the
terms of such confidentiality agreement. For purposes of this _Section 6.3_,
the term " _Person_ " means any Person or "group," as defined in Section 13(d)
of the Exchange Act, other than, with respect to the Company, Parent or any
Parent Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_, if the
Company receives, prior to the Acceptance Time, an unsolicited, written
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.3_,
which the Company Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Company
Special Committee, determines in good faith after consultation with the
Companys outside legal and financial advisors (i) constitutes a Superior
Proposal or (ii) would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal, and in each case that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then
in either event the Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish non-
public information to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, if, and
only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the Company receives from
such Person an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) engage in
discussions or negotiations with such Person with respect to the Acquisition
Proposal.

 



 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify Parent after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, any proposals
or inquiries that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal, or any inquiry or request for non-public information relating to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary by any Person who has made or would
reasonably be expected to make any Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall
indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal, inquiry
or request, and the material terms and conditions of any such proposal or
offer or the nature of the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or
request, including copies of all written requests, proposals, correspondence
or offers, including proposed agreements received by the Company. The Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis of the
status and material terms (including any amendments or proposed amendments to
such material terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition
Proposal and keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis as
to the nature of any information requested of the Company with respect thereto
and provide to Parent copies of all written materials received or sent by the
Company related thereto. The Company shall promptly provide to Parent any
material non-public information concerning the Company provided to any other
Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal that was not previously
provided to Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours after such determination)
inform Parent in writing if the Company determines to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an
Acquisition

 



      
 

 



 

Proposal pursuant to _Section 6.3(b)_. Unless this Agreement has been validly
terminated pursuant to _Section 9.1_, the Company shall not take any action
to exempt any Person (other than Parent and Purchaser) from the restrictions
on "business combinations" contained in any applicable Takeover Statute or,
with respect to any Person who has made or is considering making an
Acquisition Proposal, stock ownership limitations contained in the Company
Governing Documents or otherwise cause such restrictions or limitations not to
apply.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.3_ to the contrary, but
subject to _Section 6.3(e)_, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company Board of Directors may (i) make a Change of Recommendation in response
to an Intervening Event if the Company Board of Directors, upon the
recommendation of the Company Special Committee, has determined in good faith
after consultation with the Companys outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (ii) make a Change of
Recommendation and cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
and in accordance with _Section 9.1(g)_ in order to enter into a definitive
agreement providing for an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, which the Company
Board of Directors determined in good faith after consultation with the
Companys outside legal and financial advisors is a Superior Proposal, but
only if the Company Board of Directors has determined, upon the recommendation
of the Company Special Committee, in good faith after consultation with the
Companys outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. " _Intervening Event_ " means any event, change in
circumstance or development first occurring or arising after the date of this
Agreement that is material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (taken
as a whole) and was not known or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board
of Directors as of or prior to the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall the following events, developments or
changes in circumstances constitute an Intervening Event: (A) the receipt,
existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating thereto
or consequence thereof or (B) changes in the market price or trading volume of
the Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock or the fact that the Company
meets or exceeds (or that Parent fails to meet or exceed) internal or
published projections, forecasts or revenue or earnings predictions for any
period.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Company taking any action permitted (i) under _Section
6.3(d)(i)_, the Company shall provide Parent with three (3) business days
prior written notice advising Parent it intends to effect a Change of
Recommendation and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor, and
during such three (3) business day period, the Company shall cause its
Representatives (including its executive officers) to negotiate in good faith
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate (and if Parent does negotiate,
Parent shall cause its Representatives (including its executive officers) to
negotiate in good faith)) any proposal by Parent to amend the terms and
conditions of this Agreement in a manner that would obviate the need to effect
a Change of Recommendation and at the end of such three (3) business day
period the Company Board of Directors again makes the determination under
_Section 6.3(d)(i)_ (after in good faith taking into account any amendments
proposed by Parent), or (ii) under _Section 6.3(d)(ii)_, the Company shall
provide Parent with three (3) business days prior written notice advising
Parent that the Company Board of Directors intends to take such action and
specifying the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, and
during such three (3) business day period, the Company shall cause its
Representatives (including its executive

 



      
 

 



 

officers) to negotiate in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) any proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal and at the end of such three (3) business day period the
Company Board of Directors again makes the determination under _Section
6.3(d)(ii)_ (after in good faith taking into account the amendments proposed
by Parent). With respect to _Section 6.3(e)(ii)_, if there are any material
amendments, revisions or changes to the terms of any such Superior Proposal
(including any revision to the amount, form or mix of consideration the
Companys stockholders would receive as a result of the Superior Proposal,
whether or not material), the Company shall notify Parent of each such
amendment, revision or change in compliance with _Section 6.3(c)_ and the
applicable three (3) business day period shall be extended until at least two
(2) business days after the time that Parent receives notification from the
Company of each such amendment, revision or change and the Company Board of
Directors shall not make a Change of Recommendation prior to the end of any
such period as so extended in accordance with the terms of this _Section
6.3(e)_.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board of Directors
from: (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, if failure to do so would violate
applicable Law or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the
Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act; _provided_ that this _Section 6.3(f)_ shall not permit the
Company Board of Directors to make a Change of Recommendation except to the
extent permitted by _Section 6.3(d)_ and _Section 6.3(e)_.

 



 

(g) References in this _Section 6.3_ or in _Article I_ to the " _Company
Board of Directors_ " shall mean the Company Board of Directors or, to the
extent applicable, a committee thereof, including the Company Special
Committee.

 



 

Section 6.4. _Additional Dividends_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall declare a dividend to its
stockholders, the record and payment date for which shall be the close of
business on the last business day prior to the Acceptance Time, subject to
funds being legally available therefor; _provided_ that the payment of such
dividend may be conditioned upon the occurrence of the Acceptance Time. The
per share dividend amount payable by the Company pursuant to this _Section
6.4(a)_ shall be an amount equal to (i) the Companys then-most recent
quarterly dividend (on a per share basis), multiplied by the number of days
elapsed since the last dividend record date through and including the day
prior to the day on which the Acceptance Time occurs, and divided by the
actual number of days in the calendar quarter in which such dividend is
declared, plus (ii) an additional amount (the " _Company Additional Dividend
Amount_ "), if any, necessary so that the aggregate dividend payable is equal
to the Minimum Distribution Dividend.

 



 

(b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to determine whether
it is necessary to declare a Company Additional Dividend Amount and the amount
(if any) of the Company Additional Dividend Amount. Such determination shall
be made at least twelve (12) days prior to the then-applicable expiration date
of the Offer. It is expected that, in

 



      
 

 



 

addition to regular quarterly dividends, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Parent will pay to its stockholders, as of the
close of business on the last business day prior to the Effective Time, a
stub-period dividend, on a comparable basis as the Company dividend paid
pursuant to _Section 6.4(a)(i)_ ( _provided_ that Parent shall be permitted
to take into account increases or anticipated increases in such dividend
amount as contemplated by _Section 6.2(ii)(a)(i)_), and including an
additional per share amount equal to the Company Additional Dividend Amount
(if any) plus any Special Dividend (if any) (on a per share basis), divided by
0.9894.

information about the Companys financing, hedging activities, portfolio risk
and portfolio activities, and, at the request of Parent, the Company shall

a confidentiality agreement with a third party entered into prior to the date
of this Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or
disclosure or, if unable to do so, to make appropriate substitute arrangements
to permit reasonable access or disclosure not in violation of such consent
requirement), (B) the disclosure of which would violate any Law or duty (
_provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit
reasonable disclosure not in violation of any Law or duty), or (C) that is
subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal privilege
( _provided_ , _however_ , that the withholding Party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure to the maximum extent that

or other legal privilege); _provided_ , _however_ , that such access and
information shall be disclosed or granted, as applicable, to external counsel
for Parent to the extent reasonably required for the purpose of complying with
applicable Laws. Each of the Company and Parent will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to minimize any

 



       
 

 



 

disruption to the businesses of the other Party that may result from the
requests for access, data and information hereunder.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company and Parent will hold, and will cause its

the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or other Transactions, or from any Person

with the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent could
be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) of any
legal proceeding commenced or, to any Partys knowledge, threatened against,
such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates or otherwise relating to,
involving or affecting such Party or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, in

the Merger or any other Transaction, and (iii) upon becoming aware of the
occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance relating to it
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively,
which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the
case may be, or which would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay or impede the consummation of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)_ shall not
cure any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such
matter prior to the date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the
remedies available hereunder to any Party. The failure to deliver any such
notice shall not affect any of the conditions set forth in _Annex B_ or give
rise to any right to terminate under _Article IX_.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall cause the Company Manager and each
affiliate of the Company Manager to deliver to the Company all Contracts and
records in its possession or control to the extent they pertain to the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

submitted to, any Governmental Entity or Program Lender in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and the other Transactions, except that confidential
competitively sensitive business information may be redacted from such
exchanges. To the extent reasonably practicable, none of the Parties shall,
nor shall they permit their respective Representatives to, participate
independently in any meeting or engage in any substantive conversation with
any Governmental Entity or Program Lender in respect of any filing,
investigation or other inquiry without giving the other Party prior notice of
such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
without giving the other Parties the opportunity to attend or participate
(whether by telephone or in person) in any such meeting with such Governmental
Entity or Program Lender.

 



 

(c) In connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person with
respect to the Offer or the Merger, the Company or any Company Subsidiary
shall not pay or commit to pay to any Person whose approval or consent is
being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any accommodation or
commitment or incur any liability or other obligation to such Person without
the prior written consent of Parent. The Parties shall cooperate to obtain
such consents.

Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries or managers,
shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public

trading market to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other

in which event such Party shall endeavor, on a basis reasonable under the
circumstances, to provide a meaningful opportunity to the other Party to
review and comment upon such press release or other announcement in advance
and shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parties shall not
be required by this _Section 7.3_ to provide any such review or comment to
the other Party relating to any dispute between the Parties relating to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that each Party and their respective
affiliates and Representatives may make statements that are not inconsistent

and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present directors, officers and agents of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs
or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of
the final disposition of any actual or threatened claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the extent permitted by applicable
Law; _provided_ such Indemnified Party agrees in advance to return any such
funds to which a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in a final,
nonappealable judgment such Indemnified Party is not ultimately entitled),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action,
investigation, suit or proceeding in respect of acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions), in
connection with such Persons serving as an officer, director, employee, agent
or other fiduciary of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or of any
Person if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries, to the extent permitted by Law and provided
pursuant to the Company Governing Documents or the organizational documents of
any Company Subsidiary or any indemnification agreements, if any, in existence
on the date of this Agreement and which were provided to Parent prior to the
date hereof (including the Management Agreement). Without limiting or being
limited by the foregoing, the Parties agree that all rights to elimination of
liability, indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions
occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now
existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in their respective
charter or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) or in any agreement
(including the Management Agreement) shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Party

Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek indemnification
pursuant to this _Section 7.4_, the provisions of this _Section 7.4_ shall
continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final disposition of
all claims, actions, investigations, suits and proceedings relating thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the provisions in (i) the
Company Governing Documents and the organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary and (ii) except to the extent such agreement provides for an
earlier termination, any other agreements of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries with any Indemnified Party, in each case, regarding elimination
of liability, indemnification of officers, directors, agents and employees and
advancement of expenses that are in existence on the date of this Agreement,
copies of all of which have been provided to Parent prior to the date hereof
(including the Management Agreement), and no such provision shall be amended,
modified or repealed in any manner that would adversely affect the rights or
protections thereunder of any such Indemnified Party in respect of acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other Transactions).

 



 

(c) At or prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall purchase a six
(6)-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions providing coverage
retentions, limits and other material terms substantially equivalent to the
current policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering
without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not commit or spend on such "tail" policy
more than 300% of the last aggregate annual premium paid by the Company prior
to the date hereof for the Companys current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (the " _Base
Amount_ "), and if the cost of such "tail" policy would otherwise exceed the
Base Amount, the Company shall be permitted to purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for the Base Amount. After the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its
full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation, and no Party shall have any other obligation to purchase or pay
for insurance hereunder. The Company shall in good faith cooperate with Parent
prior to the Acceptance Time with respect to the procurement of such "tail"
policy, including with respect to the selection of the broker, available
policy price and coverage options.

 



 

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 7.4_. The rights and obligations under this
_Section 7.4_ shall survive consummation of the Offer and the Merger and
shall not be terminated or amended in a manner that is adverse to any
Indemnified Party without the written consent of such Indemnified Party. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that the Indemnified Parties shall be third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.4_, each of whom may enforce the
provisions thereof.

 



 

Section 7.5. _Takeover Statutes_. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or

 



      
 

 



 

becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so
that the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such Takeover Statute on the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions. No Change of Recommendation
shall change, or be deemed to change, the approval of the Company Board of
Directors for purposes of causing any Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to
the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions.

necessary to cause Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Parent shall, as applicable, take all such steps as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable hereto to cause any dispositions of Company equity
securities (including derivative securities) and acquisitions of Parent equity
securities pursuant to the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or officer of the Company subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Upon request, the Company shall promptly furnish Parent with all requisite
information for Parent to take the actions contemplated by this _Section
7.7_.

 



 

Section 7.8. _Security Holder Litigation_. Each Party shall provide the other
Party prompt notice of any litigation brought by any stockholder of that Party
against such Party, any of its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective
directors relating to the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or any of the
other Transactions, and shall keep the other Party informed on a prompt and
timely basis with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate (at Parents expense) in the defense or
settlement of any such litigation, the Company shall reasonably cooperate with
Parent conducting the defense or settlement of such litigation, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except
that Parent shall not be obligated to consent to any settlement which does not
include a full release of Parent and its affiliates or which imposes an
injunction or other equitable relief after the Effective Time upon Parent or
any of its affiliates. In the event of, and to the extent of, any conflict or
overlap between the provisions of this _Section 7.8_ and _Section 6.1_ or
_Section 7.2_, the provisions of this _Section 7.8_ shall control.

 



 

Section 7.9. _Delisting_. Each of the Parties agrees to cooperate with the
other Parties in taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to
delist each of the Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock from the
NYSE and terminate its registration under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that
such delisting and termination shall not be effective until after the
Effective Time.

 



 

Section 7.10. _Director Resignations_. The Company shall cause to be delivered
to Parent resignations executed by each director of the Company in office as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and effective upon the Effective
Time.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.11. _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Offer and the Merger, taken together, to qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, including by executing and
delivering customary tax representation letters to the Companys and/or
Parents counsel, as applicable, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory

set forth in the Form S-4 or (ii) the tax opinions referenced in clauses
_(E)(5)(i)_ and _(E)(5)(ii)_ of _Annex B_. None of the Parties shall (and

the Offer and the Merger, taken together, to fail to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The Parties

of the Form S-4, satisfying the requirements of Item 601 of Regulation S-K
under the Securities Act, and on the date of the expiration of the Offer.

 



 

(d) The Company and its affiliates shall, with Parents prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
take any actions, including making or causing the Company Subsidiaries to make

have been made or are to be made and certain benefits have been granted or are
to be granted according to employment compensation, severance and other
employee benefit plans of the Company, including the Company Benefit Plans

Committee_ ") (A) at a meeting held or to be held prior to the Acceptance
Time, has duly adopted or will duly adopt resolutions approving as an
"employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act (i) each

(a) On or prior to the date hereof, the Company and the Company Manager have
entered into an amendment to the Management Agreement, to which Parent is an
express third party beneficiary, terminating the Management Agreement
effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the Acceptance Time (such
amendment, the " _Termination Amendment_ "), and such termination shall be
without any liability (except to the extent specifically set forth therein and
set forth in _Section 7.14_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) to the Company,
any of the Company Subsidiaries, Parent, any affiliate of Parent, or the
Surviving Corporation. The Company has provided to Parent a true, correct and
complete copy of the Termination Amendment. For the avoidance of doubt, the
Company shall not amend, modify or waive any

Immediately prior to the Acceptance Time (except with respect to those
payments to be paid following the Acceptance Time as set forth in _Section
7.14_ of the Company Disclosure Letter), the Company shall deliver to the
Company Manager all amounts owed to the Company Manager under the Management
Agreement and the Termination Amendment, as set forth in _Section 7.14_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter. The Termination Amendment provides that,
effective as of the Acceptance Time, except with respect to amounts owed to
the Company as specifically set forth in the Termination Amendment and as set
forth in _Section 7.14_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company Manager
and its affiliates fully and unconditionally release any claims or liabilities
whatsoever that they may have against the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries, Parent, any affiliate of Parent, or the Surviving Corporation
under the Management Agreement, as amended by the Termination Amendment,
except with respect to those rights which, pursuant to the express terms of
the Termination Amendment, survive the termination of the Management
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in the Management Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall the Company pay the Company Manager any amounts in
excess of the amounts set forth in _Section 7.14_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, except with respect to those rights which, pursuant to the express
terms of the Termination Amendment, survive the termination of the Management
Agreement.

Subsidiaries shall, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their
Representatives to, (a) cooperate with Parent and Purchaser in connection with
(i) the replacement, backstopping or amendment, as of the Effective Time, of
outstanding financial guaranties, letters of credit, letters of guaranty,
surety bonds and other similar instruments and obligations of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, including granting any waivers in respect thereof
and facilitating the migration of such financial products to the facilities of
Parent or its affiliates and (ii) the satisfaction or amendment, as of the
Effective Time, of derivative financial instruments or arrangements (including
any swaps, caps, floors, futures, forward contracts and option agreements),
and (b) obtain and deliver to Parent, no later than three (3) business days
prior to the Effective Time, customary payoff letters for any Indebtedness of

authorized representative thereof), in each case as reasonably requested by
Parent.

 



 

Section 7.16. _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) For at least six (6) months following the Closing Date, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide or cause to be provided to all employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than the employees identified on _Section 7.16(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, who become employed or remain employed by the Surviving
Corporation and its Affiliates at or after the Closing Date (the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") (i) compensation at a rate of base salary or wages, as
applicable, that is not less favorable than the rate of base salary or wages
paid by the Company or its Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing Date,
and (ii) other benefits that are either substantially similar in the aggregate
to the benefits provided by the Company or its Affiliates immediately prior to
the Closing Date or substantially similar in the aggregate to the benefits
provided by Parent and its Affiliates to their employees generally who are
similarly situated to such Continuing Employees, determined in Parents sole
discretion.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each Continuing Employee shall be entitled to receive (without
duplication), (i) upon a termination of employment without Cause (as defined
below) within six (6) months following the Closing Date, a lump sum cash
severance payment (subject to execution and non-revocation of a release of
claims in favor of Parent and its Subsidiaries) equal to such Continuing
Employees Specified Compensation Amount, less the total amount of base salary
actually paid to such Continuing Employee by Parent and its Subsidiaries for
the period beginning on the date that the Effective Time occurs and ending on
the date of the Continuing Employees termination of employment, or (ii) if
such Continuing Employee remains employed with Parent and its Subsidiaries
through the date that is six (6) months following the Closing Date, a lump sum
cash bonus equal to such Continuing Employees Specified Compensation Amount,
less the total amount of base salary actually paid to such Continuing Employee
by Parent and its Subsidiaries for the period beginning on the date that the
Effective Time occurs and ending on the date that is six (6) months following
the Closing Date. The Company or the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, may
enter into a letter agreement with each of the Continuing Employees providing
for the payment of the severance payments and/or cash bonuses described in the
immediately preceding sentence, with the terms and conditions of such
agreements subject to Parents prior written consent, not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; _provided_ that, if the sum of the amounts payable under
such letter agreements exceeds $3,532,007, the Parties shall cooperate to

and demonstrably injurious to Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries); (B) the Continuing Employees
commission of fraud, misappropriation or embezzlement in connection with the
assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries); or (C) the Continuing Employees willful unauthorized
disclosure of any confidential information, or other breach of any restrictive
covenant set forth in an agreement between the Continuing Employee and Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries); and (ii) " _Specified Compensation Amount_ " means the sum of
(A) 50% of the applicable Employees 2015 annual base compensation, (B) 50% of
the grant date value of any Company RSAs granted to such Continuing Employee
in 2015 and (C) 50% of the most recent annual bonus received by such
Continuing Employee prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Each employee of the Company Manager listed on _Section 7.16(c)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter (each, a " _Manager Employee_ ") shall be entitled
to receive a cash retention payment in the amount corresponding to such
Manager Employee as set forth in _Section 7.16(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter subject to such Manager Employees continued employment with the
Company Manager through the Closing Date. The Company Manager shall enter into
a letter agreement with each of the Manager Employees providing for the
payment of the retention bonuses described in the immediately preceding
sentence, with the terms and conditions of such agreements subject to Parents
prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Parent will
pay to the Company Manager the aggregate amount of all such retention payments
actually due and payable as of the Closing Date and the Company Manager shall
immediately make such payments to the designated individuals. The Company
Manager is an express third party beneficiary of the immediately preceding
sentence.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) On and after the Closing Date, (i) Parent shall ensure, or cause to
ensure, that no limitations or exclusions as to pre-existing conditions,
evidence of insurability or good health, waiting periods or actively-at-work
exclusions or other limitations or restrictions on coverage are applicable to
any Continuing Employees or their dependents or beneficiaries under any
welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employees or their dependents
or beneficiaries may be eligible to participate, except to the extent such
exclusions, limitations or restrictions would apply under the analogous
Company Benefit Plan in which any such Continuing Employee was a participant
or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided that any costs or expenses
incurred by Continuing Employees (and their dependents or beneficiaries) up to
(and including) the Closing Date shall be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying applicable deductible, co-payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of-
pocket provisions and like adjustments or limitations on coverage under any
such welfare benefit plans, except to the extent such costs or expenses would
not be taken into account for such purposes under the analogous Company
Benefit Plan in which any such Continuing Employee was a participant or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) With respect to each employee benefit plan, policy or practice, including
severance, vacation and paid time off plans, policies or practices, sponsored
or maintained by Parent or its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation
following the Closing), Parent shall grant, or cause to be granted to, all
Continuing Employees from and after the Closing Date credit for all service
with the Company, its Affiliates and their predecessors prior to the Closing
Date for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting credit, eligibility
to commence benefits, and benefit accrual, but excluding benefit accrual under
any defined benefit pension plan and any such credit that would result in a
duplication of benefits.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 7.16 or any other provision of this
Agreement, express or implied: (i) shall be construed to establish, amend, or
modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, including any
Company Benefit Plan or any employee benefit plan of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of any of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries to amend,
modify or terminate any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement at any

former employee, director, officer or other service provider or any
participant in a Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan,
agreement or other arrangement) any right as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement.

 



 

(g) The Company, Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates shall
take all actions regarding the valuation of the Phantom Units required under
the Contracts governing the Phantom Units at the times and in the manner
required by such Contracts; _provided_ that (i) the independent valuation firm
that will determine the valuation of the Membership Units shall be reasonably
acceptable to Parent as evidenced by written consent of the Parent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and (ii) the
Company, Company Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, as applicable,
shall consult

 



       
 

 



 

with Parent regarding such valuation and shall provide Parent with the
opportunity to review and comment on any preliminary valuation reports
delivered by such independent valuation firm prior to such time as the
valuation is finalized.

 **TERMINATION**

 



 

Section 9.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer,
the Merger and the other Transactions may be abandoned, at any time before the

effective termination by Purchaser):

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

 



 

(b) by the Company, in the event that (i) the Company is not then in material
breach of this Agreement and (ii) (A) Parent and/or Purchaser shall have
breached, failed to perform or violated their respective covenants or
agreements under this Agreement, or (B) any of the representations and
warranties of Parent and Purchaser set forth in this Agreement shall have
become inaccurate, in either case of clauses (A) or (B) in a manner that would
give rise to the failure of any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in
clauses (G)(1) or (G)(2) of _Annex B_ and such breach, failure to perform,
violation or inaccuracy is not capable of being cured by the Outside Date or,
if capable of being cured by the Outside Date, is not cured by Parent and/or
Purchaser within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of written notice
from the Company of such breach, failure to perform, violation or inaccuracy;

 



 

(c) by Parent, in the event that (i) neither Parent nor Purchaser is then in
material breach of this Agreement and (ii) (A) the Company shall have
breached, failed to

 



      
 

 



 

perform or violated its covenants or agreements under this Agreement, or (B)
any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this
Agreement shall have become inaccurate, in either case of clauses (A) or (B)
in a manner that would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions to
the Offer set forth in clauses (E)(1) or (E)(2) of _Annex B_ and such breach,
failure to perform, violation or inaccuracy is not capable of being cured by
the Outside Date or, if capable of being cured by the Outside Date, is not

Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)_ shall not be available to any Party whose
action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been a
proximate cause of any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex B_
having failed to be satisfied and such action or failure to act constitutes a
material breach of this Agreement;

 



 

(e) by Parent, if, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company or the Company
Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) shall have effected a Change of
Recommendation or breached _Section 6.3_ in any material respect;

 



 

(f) by either the Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity of competent

(g) by the Company in order to effect a Change of Recommendation and enter

immediately prior (and as a condition) to the termination of this Agreement,
the Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section
9.2(b)_; or

 



 

(h) by either the Company or Parent if the Offer shall have terminated or
expired in accordance with its terms (subject to the rights and obligations of
Purchaser to extend the Offer pursuant to _Section 1.1(e)(ii)_) without
Purchaser having accepted for payment any Company Shares tendered pursuant to
the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(h)_ shall not be available to any
Party whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement
has been a proximate cause of any of the conditions to the Offer set forth in
_Annex B_ having failed to be satisfied and such action or failure to act
constitutes a material breach of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.2. _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of the valid termination of this Agreement as provided in
_Section 9.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other
Party or Parties specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void
and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent,

 



      
 

 



 

Purchaser or the Company, except that the Confidentiality Agreement, this
_Section 9.2_ and _Section 10.3_ through _Section 10.12_ shall survive such
termination; _provided_ , _however_ , nothing herein shall relieve any Party
from liability for fraud or a Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination or the requirement to make the payments set forth in _Section
9.2(b)_.

 



 

(b) _Termination Fee and Reimbursement of Expenses_.

 



 

(i) If (A) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(d)_, or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(c)_ as a result of the Company having breached, failed to perform or
violated its covenants or agreements under this Agreement, (B) an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the date of such termination, and (C) within twelve (12) months
of such termination, any Acquisition Proposal is consummated or a definitive
agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal is entered into and such
Acquisition Proposal is thereafter consummated, within two (2) business days
after the date any such Acquisition Proposal is consummated, the Company shall
pay a fee of $44,948,637.45 in cash (the " _Termination Fee_ ") to Parent.
Solely for purposes of this _Section 9.2(b)(i)_, the term "Acquisition
Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Annex A_ , except
that all references to "20%" and "80%" therein shall be deemed to be
references to "50%."

 



 

(ii) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(e)_, within
two (2) business days after such termination, the Company shall pay or cause
to be paid to Parent the Termination Fee.

 



 

(iii) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_,
immediately prior to such termination, the Company shall pay or cause to be
paid to Parent the Termination Fee.

 



 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to
pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

(c) (i) If the Company (the " _Termination Payor_ ") is required to pay
Parent (the " _Termination Payee_ ") the Termination Fee, such Termination Fee
shall be paid into escrow on the date such payment is required to be paid by
the Termination Payor pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an escrow account designated in accordance with
this _Section 9.2_. In the event that the Termination Payor is obligated to
pay the Termination Payee the Termination Fee, the amount payable to the
Termination Payee in any tax year of the Termination Payee shall not exceed
the lesser of (i) the Termination Fee payable to the Termination Payee, and
(ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to the Termination
Payee without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the requirements
of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined
as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in
Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ") and the
Termination Payee has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such
year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated
income which is not Qualifying Income), in each case, as determined by the
Termination Payees independent accountants, plus (B) in the event the
Termination Payee receives either (x) a letter from the Termination Payees
counsel indicating that the Termination

 



      
 

 



 

Payee has received a ruling from the IRS as described below or (y) an opinion
from the Termination Payees outside counsel as described below, an amount
equal to the excess of the Termination Fee less the amount payable under
clause (A) above.

 



 

(d) To secure the Termination Payors obligation to pay these amounts, the
Termination Payor shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to the
Termination Fee with an escrow agent selected by the Termination Payor on such
terms (subject to this _Section 9.2)_) as shall be mutually and reasonably
agreed upon by the Termination Payor, the Termination Payee and the escrow
agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of the Termination Fee pursuant to
this _Section 9.2_ shall be made at the time the Termination Payor is
obligated to pay the Termination Payee such amount pursuant to _Section 9.2_
by wire transfer of immediately available funds. The escrow agreement shall
provide that the Termination Fee in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be
released to the Termination Payee unless the escrow agent receives any one or
a combination of the following: (i) a letter from the Termination Payees
independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the
escrow agent to the Termination Payee without causing the Termination Payee to
fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code
determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying
Income and the Termination Payee has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources
during such year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or
anticipated income which is not Qualifying Income), in which case the escrow
agent shall release such amount to the Termination Payee, or (ii) a letter
from the Termination Payees counsel indicating that (A) the Termination Payee
received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by the Termination
Payee of the Termination Fee would either constitute Qualifying Income or
would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code or (B) the Termination Payees outside counsel has
rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Termination
Payee of the Termination Fee should either constitute Qualifying Income or
should be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow agent shall release the
remainder of the Termination Fee to the Termination Payee. The Termination
Payor agrees to amend _Section 9.2(c)_ and this _Section 9.2(d)_ at the
reasonable request of the Termination Payee in order to (i) maximize the
portion of the Termination Fee that may be distributed to the Termination
Payee hereunder without causing the Termination Payee to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, or (ii) assist the
Termination Payee in obtaining a favorable ruling or legal opinion from its
outside counsel, in each case, as described in this _Section 9.2(d)_. Any
amount of the Termination Fee that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable
year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year,
subject to the foregoing limitations of _Section 9.2(c)_ and this _Section
9.2(d)_.

 



 

(e) Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that the
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent and Purchaser in the circumstances in which the Termination
Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the Transactions. In addition,
if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to
_Section 9.2(b)_, then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent for all costs
and expenses (including disbursements and fees of counsel)

 



      
 

 



 

incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including in connection
with any related claims, actions or proceedings commenced and (ii) the Company
shall pay to Parent interest on the amounts payable pursuant to _Section
9.2(b)_ from and including the date payment of such amount or amounts were due
to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in
_The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made.

Section 10.7. _Entire Agreement Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent

objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such
action or proceeding in such courts, and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of
such action or proceeding in such courts. In the event that any action or
proceeding described in the preceding sentence is pending in the Circuit Court

any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this
_Section 10.9(b)_ in the manner provided for notices in _Section 10.4_.
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any Party to this Agreement
to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

Section 10.10. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF

PARTY CERTIFIES

 



      
 

 



 

AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION 10.10_.

the Parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties other than by virtue of the consummation
of the Transactions. Subject to the preceding sentence, but without relieving
any Party of any obligation hereunder, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 10.12. _Enforcement; Remedies_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable injury will occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with its
specific terms or is otherwise breached. It is agreed that prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_, each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or remedy any breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by any other Party, to a decree or order
of specific performance specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and to any further equitable relief.

 



 

(c) The Parties rights in this _Section 10.12_ are an integral part of the
Transactions and each Party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this _Section 10.12_ (including any objection on the basis
that there is an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of such remedy is not
an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity). For the avoidance of
doubt, each Party agrees that there is not an adequate remedy at Law for a
breach of this Agreement by any Party. In the event any Party seeks any remedy
referred to in this _Section 10.12_, such Party shall not be required to
obtain, furnish, post or provide any bond or other security in connection with
or as a condition to obtaining any such remedy.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Purchaser and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized

Annaly Capital Management, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the " _Corporation_
"), does hereby certify to the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of
Maryland that:

 



 

 _FIRST_ : Under a power contained in Article VI of the charter of the
Corporation (the " _Charter_ "), the Board of Directors of the Corporation
(the " _Board of Directors_ ") by duly adopted resolutions that reclassified
not more than 11,500,000 shares of authorized but unissued Common Stock (as
defined in the Charter) as shares of preferred stock of the Corporation, par
value $0.01 per share, and designated such shares as "Series E Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock" with the following preferences, conversion and
other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends and
other distributions, qualifications, and terms and conditions of redemption,
which, upon any restatement of the Charter, shall become part of Article VI of
the Charter, with any necessary or appropriate renumbering or relettering of
the sections or subsections hereof:

 



 

Section 1. _Designation and Number_. A series of Preferred Stock, designated
the 7.625% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per
share (the " _Series E Preferred Stock_ "), is hereby established. The number
of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be 11,500,000.

 



 

Section 2. _Rank_. The Series E Preferred Stock will rank, with respect to
dividend rights and rights upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation: (a) senior to all classes or
series of the Common Stock, and any other class or series of capital stock of
the Corporation now or hereafter authorized, issued or outstanding expressly
designated as ranking junior to the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividend
rights and rights upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation; (b) on parity with the Corporations 7.875%
Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the " _Series __ A Preferred
Stock_"), the Corporations 7.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Stock (the " _Series C Preferred Stock_ "), the Corporations 7.50% Series D
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the " _Series D Preferred Stock_ "),
and with any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation expressly
designated as ranking on parity with the Series E Preferred Stock as to

dissolution or winding up of the Corporation; and (c) junior to any class or
series of capital stock of the Corporation expressly designated as ranking
senior to the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividend rights and rights upon
the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation. The term "capital stock" does not include convertible or
exchangeable debt securities, which, prior to conversion or exchange, will
rank senior in right of payment to the

 



      
 

 



 

Series E Preferred Stock. The Series E Preferred Stock will also rank junior
in right of payment to the Corporations other existing and future debt
obligations.

 



 

Section 3. _Dividends_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the preferential rights of the holders of any class or series
of capital stock of the Corporation ranking senior to the Series E Preferred
Stock with respect to dividend rights, the holders of shares of the Series E
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by
the Board of Directors and declared by the Corporation, out of funds legally
available for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends at the rate
of 7.625% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per share of the
Series E Preferred Stock (equivalent to the fixed annual amount of $1.90625
per share of the Series E Preferred Stock). Such dividends shall accrue and be
cumulative from and including [*](1) and shall be payable to holders quarterly
in arrears on each Dividend Payment Date (as defined below), commencing [
_next payment date of Annaly preferred after merger closing_ ]; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any Dividend Payment Date is not a Business Day (as
defined below), then the dividend which would otherwise have been payable on
such Dividend Payment Date may be paid on the next succeeding Business Day,
except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year,
such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each
case with the same force and effect as if paid on such Dividend Payment Date,
and no interest or additional dividends or other sums shall accrue on the
amount so payable from such Dividend Payment Date to such next succeeding
Business Day. The amount of any dividend payable on the Series E Preferred
Stock for any Dividend Period (as defined below), including any partial
Dividend Period, shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting
of twelve 30-day months. Dividends will be payable to holders of record as
they appear in the stock records of the Corporation at the close of business
on the applicable Dividend Record Date (as defined below). Notwithstanding any
provision to the contrary contained herein, each outstanding share of Series E
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive a dividend with respect to any
Dividend Record Date equal to the dividend paid with respect to each other
share of Series E Preferred Stock that is outstanding on such date. "
_Dividend Record Date_ " shall mean the date designated by the Board of
Directors for the payment of dividends that is not more than 35 and not fewer
than 10 days prior to the applicable Dividend Payment Date. " _Dividend
Payment Date_ " shall mean, as applicable, March 31, June 30, September 30,
and December 31, commencing on [ _next payment date of Annaly preferred after
merger closing_ ]. " _Dividend Period_ " shall mean the respective periods
commencing on, and including, the first day of January, April, July and
October of each year and ending on, and including, the day preceding the first
day of the next succeeding Dividend Period (other than the Dividend Period
during which any shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be redeemed pursuant
to Section 5 or Section 6, which shall end on, and include, the

  (1) NTD: Date expected to be April 1 or July 1. If Hatteras has not declared
the second quarter dividend (i.e., closing occurs before mid-June), accrual
will begin on the first day of the first month of the second quarter (April
1), and payment dates will be the same as Annalys payment dates (i.e., second
quarter dividend to be paid on June 30). If Hatteras has declared the second
quarter dividend (expected to be on or about June 15) and closing occurs prior
to the payment date (i.e., closing occurs between June 16 and July 15), Annaly
will assume the second quarter dividend payment obligation (i.e., second
quarter dividend to be paid on July 15) and accrual for the third quarter will
begin on the first day of the first month of the quarter (July 1), and future
payment dates will be the same as Annalys payment dates. If closing occurs
after July 15 and Hatteras has not declared the third quarter dividend (i.e.,
closing occurs between July 16 and mid-September), accrual will begin on the
first day of the first month of the third quarter (July 1), and payment dates
will be the same as Annalys payment dates (i.e., third quarter dividend to be
paid on September 30).

 



      
 

 



 

day preceding the call date with respect to the shares of Series E Preferred
Stock being redeemed). The term " _Business Day_ " shall mean each day, other
than a Saturday or a Sunday, which is not a day on which banks in New York,
New York are required by law, regulation or executive order to close.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, dividends on
the Series E Preferred Stock shall accrue whether or not (i) the Corporation
has earnings, (ii) there are funds legally available for the payment of such
dividends, or (iii) those dividends are authorized or declared.

 



 

(c) Except as provided in Section 3(d) below, no dividends shall be declared
and paid or declared and set apart for payment, and no other distribution of
cash or other property may be declared and made, directly or indirectly, on or
with respect to, any shares of Common Stock or shares of any other class or
series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking, as to dividends, on parity
with or junior to the Series E Preferred Stock (other than a dividend payable
solely in shares of Common Stock or in shares of any other class or series of
capital stock ranking junior to the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividend
rights and rights upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation) for any period, nor shall any shares of
Common Stock or any other shares of any other class or series of capital stock
of the Corporation ranking, as to dividend rights and rights upon the
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, on parity with or junior to the Series E Preferred Stock be
redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration, nor shall any
funds be paid or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption of such
shares, and no other distribution of cash or other property may be made,
directly or indirectly, on or with respect thereto by the Corporation (except
(i) by conversion into or exchange for other shares of any class or series of
capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Series E Preferred
Stock as to dividend rights and rights upon the voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, (ii) for the
purchase of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, Preferred Stock of the
Corporation ranking, as to dividend rights and rights upon the voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, on
parity with the Series E Preferred Stock, or capital stock or equity
securities of the Corporation ranking, as to dividend rights and rights upon
the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, junior to the Series E Preferred Stock, by the Corporation in
accordance with the terms of Sections 5(c) and 9 of these Articles
Supplementary or otherwise, in order to ensure that the Corporation remains
qualified as a REIT (as defined in Section 9(a)) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, (iii) for the redemption or other acquisition of shares under
incentive, benefit or share purchase plans for officers, directors or
employees or others performing or providing similar services, and (iv) for the
purchase or acquisition of Preferred Stock of the Corporation ranking on
parity with the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividend rights and rights upon
the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to
holders of all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock), unless full
cumulative dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock for all past Dividend
Periods that have ended shall have been or contemporaneously are (i) declared
and paid in cash or (ii) declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof
in cash is set apart for such payment.

 



 

(d) When dividends are not paid in full (or a sum sufficient for such full
payment is not so set apart) on the Series E Preferred Stock and the shares of
any other class or

 



      
 

 



 

series of capital stock ranking, as to dividends, on parity with the Series E
Preferred Stock, all dividends declared upon the Series E Preferred Stock and
each such other class or series of capital stock ranking, as to dividends, on
parity with the Series E Preferred Stock shall be declared pro rata so that
the amount of dividends declared per share of Series E Preferred Stock and
such other class or series of capital stock shall in all cases bear to each
other the same ratio that accrued dividends per share on the Series E
Preferred Stock and such other class or series of capital stock (which shall
not include any accrual in respect of unpaid dividends on such other class or
series of capital stock for prior dividend periods if such other class or
series of capital stock does not have a cumulative dividend) bear to each
other. No interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, shall be payable in
respect of any dividend payment or payments on the Series E Preferred Stock
which may be in arrears.

 



 

(e) Holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to any
dividend, whether payable in cash, property or shares of capital stock, in
excess of full cumulative dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock as
provided herein. Any dividend payment made on the Series E Preferred Stock
shall first be credited against the earliest accrued but unpaid dividends due
with respect to such shares which remain payable. Accrued but unpaid dividends
on the Series E Preferred Stock will accumulate as of the Dividend Payment
Date on which they first become payable.

 



 

Section 4. _Liquidation Preference_.

 



 

(a) Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Corporation, before any distribution or payment shall be made to
holders of shares of Common Stock or any other class or series of capital
stock of the Corporation ranking, as to rights upon any voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, junior
to the Series E Preferred Stock, the holders of shares of Series E Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation
legally available for distribution to its stockholders, after payment of or
provision for the debts and other liabilities of the Corporation, a
liquidation preference of $25.00 per share of Series E Preferred Stock, plus
an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends (whether or not authorized
or declared) to, but not including, the date of payment. In the event that,
upon such voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the
available assets of the Corporation are insufficient to pay the full amount of
the liquidating distributions on all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred
Stock and the corresponding amounts payable on all shares of each other class
or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking, as to liquidation
rights, on parity with the Series E Preferred Stock in the distribution of
assets, then the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock and each such
other class or series of capital stock ranking, as to rights upon any
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, on parity
with the Series E Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any such distribution
of assets in proportion to the full liquidating distributions to which they
would otherwise be respectively entitled.

 



 

Written notice of any distribution in connection with any voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, stating
the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the amounts
distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be given by first
class mail, postage pre-paid, not fewer than 30 and not more than 60 days
prior to the payment date stated therein, to each record holder of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock

 



      
 

 



 

at the respective addresses of such holders as the same shall appear on the
stock transfer records of the Corporation. After payment of the full amount of
the liquidating distributions to which they are entitled, the holders of
shares of Series E Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of the
remaining assets of the Corporation. The consolidation or merger of the
Corporation with or into any other corporation, trust or other entity, or the
voluntary sale, lease, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of
the property or business of the Corporation, shall not be deemed to constitute
a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation.

 



 

(b) In determining whether a distribution (other than upon voluntary or
involuntary liquidation), by dividend, redemption or other acquisition of
shares of capital stock of the Corporation or otherwise, is permitted under
the Maryland General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_ "), amounts that would be
needed, if the Corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the
distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of holders
of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall not be added to the Corporations
total liabilities.

 



 

Section 5. _Optional Redemption_.

 



 

(a) Shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable prior to August
27, 2017 except as set forth in Section 6 or to preserve the qualification of
the Corporation as a REIT (as defined in Section 9(a)) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. In addition, the Series E Preferred Stock shall be subject to
the provisions of Section 9 pursuant to which Series E Preferred Stock owned
by a stockholder in excess of the Series E Ownership Limit (as defined in
Section 9(a)) shall automatically be transferred to a Charitable Trust (as
defined in Section 9(a)) for the exclusive benefit of a Charitable Beneficiary
(as defined in Section 9(a)).

 



 

(b) On and after August 27, 2017, the Corporation, at its option upon not
fewer than 30 and not more than 60 days written notice, may redeem the Series
E Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, for
cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid
dividends (whether or not authorized or declared) to, but not including, the
date fixed for redemption, without interest, to the extent the Corporation has
funds legally available therefor (the " _Redemption_ _Right_ "). If fewer than
all of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock are to be redeemed,
the shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected pro
rata (as nearly as may be practicable without creating fractional shares), by
lot or by any other equitable method determined by the Corporation that will
not result in a violation of the Series E Ownership Limit or the Aggregate
Stock Ownership Limit (each as defined in Section 9(a)). If such redemption is
to be by lot and, as a result of such redemption, any holder of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock (other than a holder of Series E Preferred Stock that
has received an exemption pursuant to Section 9(h)) would have Beneficial
Ownership or Constructive Ownership (each as defined in Section 9(a)) in
excess of the Series E Ownership Limit (as defined in Section 9(a)), the
Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit (as defined in Section 9(a)), or such other
limit as permitted by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof pursuant
to Section 9(i), because such holders shares of Series E Preferred Stock were
not redeemed, or were only redeemed in part, then, except as otherwise
provided in the Charter, the Corporation shall redeem the requisite number of
shares of Series E Preferred Stock of such holder such that no holder will own
an amount of Series E Preferred Stock in excess of the applicable ownership
limit, subsequent to such redemption. Holders of shares of Series E Preferred
Stock to be redeemed shall surrender such shares of Series E Preferred Stock
at the place, or in accordance with the

 



      
 

 



 

book-entry procedures, designated in the notice of redemption and shall be
entitled to the redemption price of $25.00 per share plus all accrued and
unpaid dividends (whether or not authorized or declared) to, but not
including, the date of redemption. If (i) notice of redemption of any shares
of Series E Preferred Stock has been given, (ii) the funds necessary for such
redemption have been set apart by the Corporation in trust for the benefit of
the holders of any shares of Series E Preferred Stock so called for
redemption, and (iii) irrevocable instructions have been given to pay the
redemption price and all accrued and unpaid dividends, then from and after the
redemption date, dividends shall cease to accrue on such shares of Series E
Preferred Stock, such shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall no longer be
deemed outstanding, and all rights of the holders of such shares shall
terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price plus any accrued
and unpaid dividends payable upon such redemption, without interest. So long
as full cumulative dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock for all past
Dividend Periods that have ended shall have been or contemporaneously are (i)
declared and paid in cash, or (ii) declared and a sum sufficient for the
payment thereof in cash is set apart for payment, subject to the provisions of
applicable law, nothing herein shall prevent or restrict the Corporations
right or ability, from time to time, to repurchase all or any part of the
Series E Preferred Stock, including the repurchase of shares of Series E
Preferred Stock in open-market transactions and individual purchases at such
prices as negotiated by the Corporation, in each case as duly authorized by
the Board of Directors.

 



 

(c) In the event of any redemption of the Series E Preferred Stock in order to
preserve the qualification of the Corporation as a REIT (as defined in Section
9(a)) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such redemption shall be made in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Sections 5 and 9 of
these Articles Supplementary. If the Corporation calls for redemption of any
shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to and in accordance with this
Section 5(c), then the redemption price for such shares will be an amount in
cash equal to $25.00 per share together with all accrued and unpaid dividends
to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption.

 



 

(d) Unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of the Series E Preferred
Stock for all past Dividend Periods that have ended shall have been or
contemporaneously are authorized and (i) declared and paid in cash, or (ii)
declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof in cash is set apart for
payment, no shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be redeemed pursuant to
the Redemption Right or the Special Optional Redemption Right (as defined in
Section 6(a)) unless all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock are
simultaneously redeemed, and the Corporation shall not purchase or otherwise
acquire directly or indirectly any shares of Series E Preferred Stock or any
class or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking, as to dividend
rights and rights upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation, on parity with or junior to the Series E
Preferred Stock (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of capital
stock of the Corporation ranking, as to dividend rights and rights upon the
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, junior to the Series E Preferred Stock); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the foregoing shall not prevent (i) the purchase of shares of Series E
Preferred Stock, Preferred Stock of the Corporation ranking, as to dividend
rights and rights upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation, on parity with the Series E Preferred Stock,
or capital stock or equity securities of the Corporation ranking, as to
dividend rights and rights upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, junior to the Series E Preferred
Stock, by the Corporation in accordance with the terms of Sections 5(c) and 9
of these

 



      
 

 



 

Articles Supplementary or otherwise, in order to ensure that the Corporation
remains qualified as a REIT (as defined in Section 9(a)) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (ii) the redemption or acquisition of shares under
incentive, benefit or share purchase plans for officers, directors or
employees or others performing or providing similar services, or (iii) the
purchase or acquisition of shares of Series E Preferred Stock or Preferred
Stock of the Corporation ranking on parity with the Series E Preferred Stock
as to dividend rights and rights upon the voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation pursuant to a
purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all
outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock.

 



 

(e) Notice of redemption pursuant to the Redemption Right will be mailed by
the Corporation, postage prepaid, not fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days
prior to the redemption date, addressed to the respective holders of record of
the Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their respective addresses as
they appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation as maintained by
the transfer agent of the Corporation. No failure to give such notice or any
defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the
proceedings for the redemption of any shares of Series E Preferred Stock
except as to the holder to whom such notice was defective or not given. In
addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of any
exchange upon which the Series E Preferred Stock may be listed or admitted to
trading, each such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii) the
redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be
redeemed; (iv) the place or places where the certificates, if any,
representing shares of Series E Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for
payment of the redemption price; (v) procedures for surrendering
noncertificated shares of Series E Preferred Stock for payment of the
redemption price; (vi) that dividends on the shares of Series E Preferred
Stock to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on such redemption date; and
(vii) that payment of the redemption price and any accumulated and unpaid
dividends will be made upon presentation and surrender of such Series E
Preferred Stock. If fewer than all of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock
held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to such holder shall
also specify the number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by such
holder to be redeemed. The redemption of shares of Series E Preferred Stock
may be made conditional on such factors as may be determined by the Board of
Directors and set forth in the notice of redemption.

 



 

(f) If a redemption date falls after a Dividend Record Date and on or prior to
the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, each holder of shares of Series E
Preferred Stock at the close of business on such Dividend Record Date shall be
entitled to the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding Dividend
Payment Date notwithstanding the redemption of such shares on or prior to such
Dividend Payment Date, and each holder of shares of Series E Preferred Stock
that surrenders such shares on such redemption date will be entitled to the
dividends accruing after the end of the Dividend Period to which such Dividend
Payment Date relates to, but not including, the date of redemption. Except as
provided herein, the Corporation shall make no payment or allowance for unpaid
dividends, whether or not in arrears, on Series E Preferred Stock for which a
notice of redemption has been given.

 



 

(g) All shares of Series E Preferred Stock redeemed or repurchased pursuant to
this Section 5, or otherwise acquired in any other manner by the Corporation,
shall be retired and shall be restored to the status of authorized but
unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation as to series or class.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6. _Special Optional Redemption by the Corporation_.

 



 

(a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined below), the
Corporation may, at its option upon written notice mailed by the Corporation,
postage pre-paid, no fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the
redemption date and addressed to the holders of record of shares of the Series
E Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their respective addresses as they appear
on the stock transfer records of the Corporation, redeem the Series E
Preferred Stock, in whole or in part within 120 days after the first date on
which such Change of Control occurred, for cash at $25.00 per share plus
accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the redemption date (the "
_Special Optional Redemption Right_ "). No failure to give such notice or any
defect thereto or in the mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the
proceedings for the redemption of any shares of Series E Preferred Stock
except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. If, prior
to the Change of Control Conversion Date (as defined in Section 8(a)), the
Corporation has provided or provides notice of redemption with respect to the
Series E Preferred Stock (whether pursuant to the Redemption Right or the
Special Optional Redemption Right), the holders of shares of Series E
Preferred Stock will not have the conversion right described below in Section
8.

 



 

A " _Change of Control_ " is when, after the original issuance of the Series E
Preferred Stock, the following have occurred and are continuing:

 



 

(i) the acquisition by any person, including any syndicate or group deemed to
be a "person" under Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), of beneficial ownership, directly or
indirectly, through a purchase, merger or other acquisition transaction or
series of purchases, mergers or other acquisition transactions of stock of the
Corporation entitling that person to exercise more than 50% of the total
voting power of all stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the
election of the Corporations directors (except that such person will be
deemed to have beneficial ownership of all securities that such person has the
right to acquire, whether such right is currently exercisable or is
exercisable only upon the occurrence of a subsequent condition); and

 



 

(ii) following the closing of any transaction referred to in (i) above,
neither the Corporation nor the acquiring or surviving entity has a class of
common securities (or American Depositary Receipts representing such
securities) listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ "), the NYSE
MKT (the " _NYSE MKT_ "), or the NASDAQ Stock Market (" _NASDAQ_ "), or listed
or quoted on an exchange or quotation system that is a successor to the NYSE,
the NYSE MKT or NASDAQ.

 



 

(b) In addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules
of any exchange upon which the Series E Preferred Stock may be listed or
admitted to trading, such notice shall state: (i) the redemption date; (ii)
the redemption price; (iii) the number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock
to be redeemed; (iv) the place or places where the certificates, if any,
representing shares of Series E Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for
payment of the redemption price; (v) procedures for surrendering
noncertificated shares of Series E Preferred Stock for payment of the
redemption price; (vi) that dividends on the shares of Series E Preferred
Stock to be redeemed will cease to accumulate on the redemption date; (vii)
that payment of the redemption price and any accumulated and unpaid dividends
will be made upon presentation and

 



      
 

 



 

surrender of such Series E Preferred Stock; (viii) that the shares of Series E
Preferred Stock are being redeemed pursuant to the Special Optional Redemption
Right in connection with the occurrence of a Change of Control and a brief
description of the transaction or transactions constituting such Change of
Control; and (ix) that the holders of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock
to which the notice relates will not be able to tender such shares of Series E
Preferred Stock for conversion in connection with the Change of Control and
each share of Series E Preferred Stock tendered for conversion that is
selected, prior to the Change of Control Conversion Date, for redemption will
be redeemed on the related redemption date instead of converted on the Change
of Control Conversion Date. If fewer than all of the shares of Series E
Preferred Stock held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice mailed to
such holder shall also specify the number of shares of Series E Preferred
Stock held by such holder to be redeemed.

 



 

If fewer than all of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock are to
be redeemed pursuant to the Special Optional Redemption Right, the shares of
Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected pro rata (as nearly
as may be practicable without creating fractional shares), by lot or by any
other equitable method determined by the Corporation that will not result in a
violation of the Series E Ownership Limit or the Aggregate Stock Ownership
Limit (each as defined in Section 9(a)). If such redemption pursuant to the
Special Optional Redemption Right is to be by lot and, as a result, any holder
of shares of Series E Preferred Stock (other than a holder of Series E
Preferred Stock that has received an exemption pursuant to Section 9(h)) would
have Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership (each as defined in
Section 9(a)) in excess of the Series E Ownership Limit (as defined in Section
9(a)), the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit (as defined in Section 9(a)), or
such limit as permitted by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof
pursuant to Section 9(i), because such holders shares of Series E Preferred
Stock were not redeemed, or were only redeemed in part, then, except as
otherwise provided in the Charter, the Corporation shall redeem the requisite
number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock of such holder such that no
holder will hold an amount of Series E Preferred Stock in excess of the
applicable ownership limit, subsequent to such redemption.

 



 

(c) If the Corporation has given a notice of redemption pursuant to the
Special Optional Redemption Right and has set apart sufficient funds for the
redemption in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Series E Preferred
Stock called for redemption, then from and after the redemption date, those
shares of Series E Preferred Stock will be treated as no longer being
outstanding, no further dividends will accrue and all other rights of the
holders of those shares of Series E Preferred Stock will terminate. The
holders of those shares of Series E Preferred Stock will retain their right to
receive the redemption price for their shares and any accrued and unpaid
dividends to, but not including, the redemption date, without interest. So
long as full cumulative dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock for all past
Dividend Periods that have ended shall have been or contemporaneously are (i)
declared and paid in cash, or (ii) declared and a sum sufficient for the
payment thereof in cash is set apart for payment, subject to the provisions of
applicable law, nothing herein shall prevent or restrict the Corporations
right or ability, from time to time, to repurchase all or any part of the
Series E Preferred Stock, including the repurchase of shares of Series E
Preferred Stock in open-market transactions and individual purchases at such
prices as negotiated by the Corporation, in each case duly authorized by the
Board of Directors.

 



 

(d) The holders of Series E Preferred Stock at the close of business on a
Dividend Record Date will be entitled to receive the dividend payable with
respect to the Series E

 



      
 

 



 

Preferred Stock on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date notwithstanding the
redemption of the Series E Preferred Stock pursuant to the Special Optional
Redemption Right between such Dividend Record Date and the corresponding
Dividend Payment Date or the Corporations default in the payment of the
dividend due. Except as provided herein, the Corporation shall make no payment
or allowance for unpaid dividends, whether or not in arrears, on Series E
Preferred Stock for which a notice of redemption pursuant to the Special
Optional Redemption Right has been given.

 



 

(e) All shares of Series E Preferred Stock redeemed or repurchased pursuant to
this Section 6, or otherwise acquired in any other manner by the Corporation,
shall be retired and shall be restored to the status of authorized but
unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation as to series or class.

 



 

Section 7. _Voting Rights_.

 



 

(a) Holders of the Series E Preferred Stock shall not have any voting rights,
except as set forth in this Section 7.

 



 

(b) Whenever dividends on any shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be in
arrears for six or more consecutive or non-consecutive quarterly periods (a "
_Preferred Dividend Default_ "), the holders of shares of the Series E
Preferred Stock (voting together as a single class with the holders of all
other classes or series of preferred stock of the Corporation upon which like
voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (" _Parity Preferred_
")) shall be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional
directors of the Corporation (the " _Preferred Directors_ ") and the entire
Board of Directors will be increased by two directors, until all dividends
accumulated on such Series E Preferred Stock and Parity Preferred for the past
Dividend Periods that have ended shall have been fully paid or declared and a
sum sufficient for the payment thereof is set apart for payment;

 



 

(c) The Preferred Directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast
in the election for a one-year term and each Preferred Director will serve
until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until such
Preferred Directors right to hold the office terminates, whichever occurs
earlier, subject to such Preferred Directors earlier death, disqualification,
resignation or removal. The election will take place at (i) either (A) a
special meeting called in accordance with Section 7(d) below if the request is
received more than 90 days before the date fixed for the Corporations next
annual or special meeting of stockholders or (B) the next annual or special
meeting of stockholders if the request is received within 90 days of the date
fixed for the Corporations next annual or special meeting of stockholders,
and (ii) at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders, or special meeting
held in place thereof, until all such dividends in arrears on the Series E
Preferred Stock and each such class or series of outstanding Parity Preferred
have been paid in full. A dividend in respect of Series E Preferred Stock
shall be considered timely made if made within two Business Days after the
applicable Dividend Payment Date if at the time of such late payment date
there shall not be any prior Dividend Periods in respect of which full
dividends were not timely made at the applicable Dividend Payment Date.

 



 

(d) At any time when such voting rights shall have vested, a proper officer of
the Corporation shall call or cause to be called, upon written request of
holders of record of at least

 



       
 

 



 

10% of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock and Parity
Preferred, a special meeting of the holders of Series E Preferred Stock and
each class or series of Parity Preferred by mailing or causing to be mailed to
such holders a notice of such special meeting to be held not fewer than ten or
more than 45 days after the date such notice is given. The record date for
determining holders of the Series E Preferred Stock and Parity Preferred
entitled to notice of and to vote at such special meeting will be the close of
business on the third Business Day preceding the day on which such notice is
mailed. At any such annual or special meeting, all of the holders of the
Series E Preferred Stock and Parity Preferred, by plurality vote, voting
together as a single class without regard to class or series will be entitled
to elect two directors on the basis of one vote per $25.00 of liquidation
preference to which such Series E Preferred Stock and Parity Preferred are
entitled by their terms (excluding amounts in respect of accumulated and
unpaid dividends) and not cumulatively. The holder or holders of one-third of
the Series E Preferred Stock and Parity Preferred voting as a single class
then outstanding, present in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum for
the election of the Preferred Directors except as otherwise provided by law.
Notice of all meetings at which holders of the Series E Preferred Stock and
the Parity Preferred shall be entitled to vote will be given to such holders
at their addresses as they appear in the stock transfer records. At any such
meeting or adjournment thereof in the absence of a quorum, subject to the
provisions of any applicable law, a majority of the holders of the Series E
Preferred Stock and Parity Preferred voting as a single class present in
person or by proxy shall have the power to adjourn the meeting for the
election of the Preferred Directors, without notice other than an announcement
at the meeting, until a quorum is present. If a Preferred Dividend Default
shall terminate after the notice of a special meeting has been given but
before such special meeting has been held, the Corporation shall, as soon as
practicable after such termination, mail or cause to be mailed notice of such
termination to holders of the Series E Preferred Stock and the Parity
Preferred that would have been entitled to vote at such special meeting.

 



 

(e) If and when all accumulated dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock and
all classes or series of Parity Preferred for the past dividend periods shall
have been fully paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment thereof
is set apart for payment, the right of the holders of Series E Preferred Stock
and the Parity Preferred to elect such additional two directors shall
immediately cease (subject to re-vesting in the event of each and every
Preferred Dividend Default), and the term of office of each Preferred Director
so elected shall terminate and the entire Board of Directors shall be reduced
accordingly.

 



 

Any Preferred Director may be removed at any time with or without cause by the
vote of, and shall not be removed otherwise than by the vote of, the holders
of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock
and the Parity Preferred entitled to vote thereon when they have the voting
rights set forth in Section 7(b) (voting as a single class). So long as a
Preferred Dividend Default shall continue, any vacancy in the office of a
Preferred Director may be filled by written consent of the Preferred Director
remaining in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of
record of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock
when they have the voting rights described above (voting as a single class
with all other classes or series of Parity Preferred). Each of the Preferred
Directors shall be entitled to one vote on any matter.

 



 

(f) So long as any shares of Series E Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the
affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of Series

 



      
 

 



 

E Preferred Stock together with the holders of all other shares of any class
or series of preferred stock ranking on parity with the Series E Preferred
Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets
upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, given in
person or by proxy, either in writing or at a meeting (voting as a single
class) will be required to: (i) authorize, create or issue, or increase the
number of authorized or issued shares of, any class or series of capital stock
ranking senior to the Series E Preferred Stock with respect to payment of
dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation, or reclassify any authorized shares of capital
stock of the Corporation into such capital stock, or create, authorize or
issue any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing the right to
purchase any such shares of capital stock; or (ii) amend, alter or repeal the
provisions of the Charter, including the terms of the Series E Preferred
Stock, whether by merger, consolidation, transfer or conveyance of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or otherwise, so as to
materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege or voting
power of the Series E Preferred Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that with
respect to the occurrence of any of the events set forth in clause (ii) above,
so long as (1) the Series E Preferred Stock remains outstanding with the terms
thereof materially unchanged, or (2) the holders of the Series E Preferred
Stock receive equity securities with rights, preferences, privileges and
voting powers substantially the same as those of the Series E Preferred Stock,
then the occurrence of such event shall not be deemed to materially and
adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of the
Series E Preferred Stock, and in such case such holders shall not have any
voting rights with respect to the occurrence of any of the events set forth in
clause (ii) above. In addition, if, pursuant to the occurrence of any of the
events set forth in clause (ii) above, the holders of the Series E Preferred
Stock receive the greater of the full trading price of the Series E Preferred
Stock on the date of such event set forth in clause (ii) above or the $25.00
per share liquidation preference plus accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not
including, the date of such event set forth in clause (ii) above, then such
holders shall not have any voting rights with respect to the events set forth
in clause (ii) above.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the occurrence of any such event would
materially and adversely affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting
powers of the Series E Preferred Stock disproportionately relative to other
classes or series of preferred stock ranking on parity with the Series E
Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution
of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, then
the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock (voting as a separate class)
shall also be required.

 



 

Holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to vote
with respect to (A) any increase in the total number of authorized shares of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock of the Corporation, or (B) any increase in the
number of authorized shares of Series E Preferred Stock or the creation or
issuance of any other class or series of capital stock, or (C) any increase in
the number of authorized shares of any other class or series of capital stock,
in each case referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) above ranking on parity
with or junior to the Series E Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of
dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Corporation.

 



 

Except as set forth herein, holders of the Series E Preferred Stock shall not
have any voting rights with respect to, and the consent of the holders of
shares of the Series E Preferred Stock shall

 



      
 

 



 

not be required for, the taking of any corporate action, including any merger
or consolidation involving the Corporation or a sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Corporation, regardless of the effect that such
corporate action or event may have upon the powers, preferences, voting power
or other rights or privileges of the Series E Preferred Stock.

 



 

(g) The foregoing voting provisions of this Section 7 shall not apply if, at
or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would
otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series E
Preferred Stock shall have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper
notice and sufficient funds, in cash, shall have been deposited in trust to
effect such redemption.

 



 

(h) In any matter in which the Series E Preferred Stock may vote (as expressly
provided herein), each share of Series E Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
one vote per $25.00 of liquidation preference.

 



 

Section 8. _Conversion_. The shares of Series E Preferred Stock are not
convertible into or exchangeable for any other property or securities of the
Corporation, except as provided in this Section 8.

 



 

(a) Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, each holder of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock shall have the right, unless, prior to the Change of
Control Conversion Date (as defined below), the Corporation has provided or
provides notice of its election to redeem some or all of the Series E
Preferred Stock pursuant to the Redemption Right or the Special Optional
Redemption Right, to convert some or all of the Series E Preferred Stock held
by such holder (the " _Change of Control Conversion Right_ ") on the Change of
Control Conversion Date into a number of shares of Common Stock per share of
Series E Preferred Stock to be converted (the " _Common Stock Conversion
Consideration_ "), which is equal to the lesser of (A) the quotient obtained
by dividing (i) the sum of (x) the $25.00 liquidation preference per share of
Series E Preferred Stock to be converted plus (y) the amount of any accrued
and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the Change of Control Conversion
Date (unless the Change of Control Conversion Date is after a Dividend Record
Date and prior to the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, in which case no
additional amount for such accrued and unpaid dividends will be included in
such sum) by (ii) the Common Stock Price (as defined below) and (B) [*]
(2)(the " _Share Cap_ "), subject to the immediately succeeding paragraph.

 



 

The Share Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any stock splits
(including those effected pursuant to a distribution of the Common Stock),
subdivisions or combinations (in each case, a " _Stock Split_ ") with respect
to the Common Stock as follows: the adjusted Share Cap as the result of a
Stock Split shall be the number of shares of Common Stock that is equivalent
to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Share Cap in effect immediately
prior to such Stock Split by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding

  (2) NTD: Share cap to be adjusted to preserve the economics of the Hatteras
Preferred. Formula would be: New Share Cap is equal to (A) Old Share Cap,
multiplied by (B) a fraction in which (i) the numerator is equal to the sum of
(x) the cash portion of the mixed consideration and (y) the product of (1) the
stock portion of the mixed consideration and (2) the Annaly stock price as of
closing (measured using a 10-day VWAP prior to closing), and (ii) the
denominator is the Annaly stock price as of closing.

 



      
 

 



 

after giving effect to such Stock Split and the denominator of which is the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to such Stock
Split.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence,
the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock (or equivalent Alternative
Conversion Consideration (as defined below), as applicable) issuable or
deliverable, as applicable, in connection with the exercise of the Change of
Control Conversion Right shall not exceed the product of the Share Cap times
the aggregate number of shares of the Series E Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding at the Change of Control Conversion Date (or equivalent
Alternative Conversion Consideration, as applicable) (the " _Exchange Cap_ ").
The Exchange Cap is subject to pro rata adjustments for any Stock Splits on
the same basis as the corresponding adjustment to the Share Cap.

 



 

In the case of a Change of Control pursuant to which shares of Common Stock
shall be converted into cash, securities or other property or assets
(including any combination thereof) (the " _Alternative Form Consideration_
"), a holder of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall receive upon
conversion of such shares of Series E Preferred Stock the kind and amount of
Alternative Form Consideration which such holder would have owned or been
entitled to receive upon the Change of Control had such holder held a number
of shares of Common Stock equal to the Common Stock Conversion Consideration
immediately prior to the effective time of the Change of Control (the "
_Alternative Conversion Consideration_ "). The Common Stock Conversion
Consideration or the Alternative Conversion Consideration, as may be
applicable to a Change of Control, shall be referred to herein as the "
_Conversion Consideration_."

 



 

In the event that holders of Common Stock have the opportunity to elect the
form of consideration to be received in the Change of Control, the Conversion
Consideration will be deemed to be the kind and amount of consideration
actually received by holders of a majority of the Common Stock that voted for
such an election (if electing between two types of consideration) or holders
of a plurality of the Common Stock that voted for such an election (if
electing between more than two types of consideration), as the case may be,
and will be subject to any limitations to which all holders of Common Stock
are subject, including, without limitation, pro rata reductions applicable to
any portion of the consideration payable in the Change of Control.

 



 

The " _Change of Control Conversion Date_ " is the date the Series E Preferred
Stock is to be converted, which shall be a Business Day set forth in the
notice of Change of Control provided in accordance with Section 8(c) below
that is no fewer than 20 days nor more than 35 days after the date on which
the Corporation mails such notice pursuant to Section 8(c).

Constructive Ownership (each as defined in Section 9(a)) in excess of the
Series E Ownership Limit (as defined in Section 9(a)), the Aggregate Stock
Ownership Limit (as defined in Section 9(a)), or such other limit as permitted

that such Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of Series E Preferred
Stock, taking into account any other Capital Stock of the Corporation

the Capital Stock being Beneficially Owned by less than one hundred (100)
Persons (determined under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code).

 



 

(D) Except as provided in Section 9(h) hereof, no Person shall Beneficially

Supplementary, (A) then that number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock the
Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of which otherwise would cause

(rounded up to the nearest whole share) shall be automatically transferred to
a Charitable Trust for the benefit of a Charitable Beneficiary, as described
in Section 9(c), effective as of the close of business on the Business Day
prior to the date of such Transfer, and such Person shall acquire no rights in
such shares of Series E Preferred Stock; or (B) if the transfer to the
Charitable Trust described in clause (A) of this sentence would not be
effective for any reason to prevent the violation of Section 9(b)(i) of these
Articles Supplementary, then the Transfer of that number of shares of Series E
Preferred Stock that otherwise would cause any Person to violate Section
9(b)(i) shall be void ab initio, and the intended transferee shall acquire no
rights in such shares of Series E Preferred Stock.

dividends or other distributions and shall not possess any rights to vote or
other rights attributable to the shares held in the Charitable Trust.

 



 

(iii) The Trustee shall have all voting rights and rights to dividends or
other distributions with respect to shares of Series E Preferred Stock held in
the Charitable Trust, which rights shall be exercised for the exclusive
benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary. Any dividend or other distribution paid
to the Prohibited Owner prior to the discovery by the Corporation that the
shares of Series E Preferred Stock have been transferred to the Trustee shall
be paid with respect to such shares of Series E Preferred Stock by the
Prohibited Owner to the Trustee upon demand and any dividend or other
distribution authorized but unpaid shall be paid when due to the Trustee. Any
dividends or distributions so paid over to the Trustee shall be held in trust
for the Charitable Beneficiary. The Prohibited Owner shall have no voting
rights with respect

 



       
 

 



 

to shares held in the Charitable Trust and, subject to Maryland law, effective
as of the date that the shares of Series E Preferred Stock have been
transferred to the Trustee, the Trustee shall have the authority (at the
Trustees sole discretion) (i) to rescind as void any vote cast by a
Prohibited Owner prior to the discovery by the Corporation that the shares of
Series E Preferred Stock have been transferred to the Trustee and (ii) to re-
cast such vote in accordance with the desires of the Trustee acting for the
benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
Corporation has already taken irreversible corporate action, then the Trustee
shall not have the authority to rescind and re-cast such vote. Notwithstanding
the provisions of these Articles Supplementary to the contrary, until the
Corporation has received notification that shares of Series E Preferred Stock
have been transferred into a Charitable Trust, the Corporation shall be
entitled to rely on its share transfer and other stockholder records for
purposes of preparing lists of stockholders entitled to vote at meetings,
determining the validity and authority of proxies and otherwise conducting
votes of stockholders.

 



 

(iv) Within 20 days of receiving notice from the Corporation that shares of
Series E Preferred Stock have been transferred to the Charitable Trust, the
Trustee of the Charitable Trust shall sell the shares held in the Charitable
Trust to a person, designated by the Trustee, whose ownership of the shares
will not violate the ownership limitations set forth in Section 9(b)(i). Upon
such sale, the interest of the Charitable Beneficiary in the shares sold shall
terminate and the Trustee shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the
Prohibited Owner and to the Charitable Beneficiary as provided in this Section
9(c)(iv). The Prohibited Owner shall receive the lesser of (1) the price paid
by the Prohibited Owner for the shares or, if the Prohibited Owner did not
give value for the shares in connection with the event causing the shares to
be held in the Charitable Trust ( _e.g._ , in the case of a gift, devise or
other such transfer), the Market Price of the shares on the day of the event
causing the shares to be held in the Charitable Trust and (2) the price per
share received by the Trustee (net of any commissions and other expenses of
sale) from the sale or other disposition of the shares held in the Charitable
Trust. The Trustee may reduce the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner by
the amount of dividends and distributions paid to the Prohibited Owner and
owed by the Prohibited Owner to the Trustee pursuant to Section 9(c)(iii). Any
net sales proceeds in excess of the amount payable to the Prohibited Owner
shall be immediately paid to the Charitable Beneficiary. If, prior to the
discovery by the Corporation that shares of Series E Preferred Stock have been
transferred to the Trustee, such shares are sold by a Prohibited Owner, then
(i) such shares shall be deemed to have been sold on behalf of the Charitable
Trust and (ii) to the extent that the Prohibited Owner received an amount for
such shares that exceeds the amount that such Prohibited Owner was entitled to
receive pursuant to this Section 9(c)(iv), such excess shall be paid to the
Trustee upon demand.

 



 

(v) Shares of Series E Preferred Stock transferred to the Trustee shall be
deemed to have been offered for sale to the Corporation, or its designee, at a
price per share equal to the lesser of (i) the price per share in the
transaction that resulted in such transfer to the Charitable Trust (or, in the
case of a devise or gift, the Market Price at the time of such devise or gift)
and (ii) the Market Price on the date the Corporation, or its designee,
accepts such offer. The Corporation may reduce the amount payable to the
Prohibited Owner by the amount of dividends and distributions paid to the
Prohibited Owner and owed by the Prohibited Owner to the Trustee pursuant to
Section 9(c)(iii). The Corporation may pay the amount of such reduction to the
Trustee for the benefit of the Charitable Beneficiary. The Corporation shall
have the right to accept such offer until the Trustee has sold the shares held
in the Charitable Trust pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9(c)(iv). Upon such a sale to the Corporation, the interest of the
Charitable Beneficiary in the shares sold shall terminate and the Trustee
shall distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Prohibited Owner and any
dividends or other distributions held by the Trustee shall be paid to the
Charitable Beneficiary.

 



 

(vi) By written notice to the Trustee, the Corporation shall designate one or
more nonprofit organizations to be the Charitable Beneficiary of the interest
in the Charitable Trust such that (i) the shares of Series E Preferred Stock
held in the Charitable Trust would not violate the restrictions set forth in
Section 9(b)(i) in the hands of such Charitable Beneficiary and (ii) each such
organization must be described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code and
contributions to each such organization must be eligible for deduction under
one of Sections 170(b)(1)(A), 2055 and 2522 of the Code.

 



 

(d) _Remedies for Breach_. If the Board of Directors of the Corporation or any
duly authorized committee thereof or other designees if permitted by the MGCL
shall at any time determine in good faith that a Transfer or other event has
taken place that results in a violation of Section 9(b) of these Articles
Supplementary or that a Person intends to acquire or has attempted to acquire
Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of any shares of Series E
Preferred Stock in violation of Section 9(b) of these Articles Supplementary
(whether or not such violation is intended), the Board of Directors or a
committee thereof or other designees if permitted by the MGCL shall take such
action as it deems advisable to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such
Transfer or other event, including, without limitation, causing the
Corporation to redeem shares, refusing to give effect to such Transfer on the
books of the Corporation or instituting proceedings to enjoin such Transfer or
other event; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Transfers or attempted
Transfers or other events in violation of Section 9(b)(i) of these Articles
Supplementary shall automatically result in the transfer to the Charitable
Trust described above, and, where applicable, such Transfer (or other event)
shall be void ab initio as provided above irrespective of any action (or non-
action) by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof.

 



 

(e) _Notice of Restricted Transfer_. Any Person who acquires or attempts or
intends to acquire Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock that will or may violate Section 9(b)(i) or any
Person who would have owned shares of Series E Preferred Stock that resulted
in a transfer to the Charitable Trust pursuant to the provisions of Section
9(b)(ii) of these Articles Supplementary shall immediately give written notice
to the Corporation of such event or, in the case of such a proposed or
attempted transaction, give at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice,
and shall provide to the Corporation such other information as the Corporation
may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such Transfer on the
Corporations qualification as a REIT.

 



 

(f) _Owners Required To Provide Information_. Prior to the Restriction
Termination Date, each Person who is a Beneficial Owner or Constructive Owner
of Series E Preferred Stock and each Person (including the stockholder of
record) who is holding Series E Preferred Stock for a Beneficial Owner or
Constructive Owner shall provide to the Corporation such information as the
Corporation may request, in good faith, in order to determine the
Corporations qualification as a REIT and to comply with requirements of any
taxing authority or governmental authority or to determine such compliance and
to ensure compliance with the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit and the Series E
Ownership Limit.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) _Remedies Not Limited_. Nothing contained in these Articles Supplementary
shall limit the authority of the Board of Directors of the Corporation to take
such other action as it deems necessary or advisable to protect the
Corporation and the interests of its stockholders in preserving the
Corporations qualification as a REIT.

 



 

(h) _Exceptions_.

 



 

(i) The Board of Directors of the Corporation, in its sole discretion, may
exempt (prospectively or retroactively) a Person from the Aggregate Stock
Ownership Limit or the Series E Ownership Limit or the restriction under
Sections 9(b)(i)(B), as the case may be, and may establish or increase an
Excepted Holder Limit for such Person if the Board of Directors obtains such
representations, covenants and undertakings as the Board of Directors may deem
appropriate in order to conclude that granting the exemption and/or
establishing or increasing the Excepted Holder Limit, as the case may be, will
not cause the Corporation to lose its qualification as a REIT.

 



 

(ii) Prior to granting any exception pursuant to Section 9(h)(i), the Board of
Directors of the Corporation may require a ruling from the Internal Revenue
Service, or an opinion of counsel, in either case in form and substance
satisfactory to the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, as it may deem
necessary or advisable in order to determine or ensure the Corporations
qualification as a REIT. Notwithstanding the receipt of any ruling or opinion,
the Board of Directors may impose such conditions or restrictions as it deems
appropriate in connection with granting such exception.

 



 

(iii) Subject to Sections 9(b)(i)(B), (C) and (D), an underwriter, placement
agent or initial purchaser that participates in a public offering, a private
placement or private resale of Series E Preferred Stock (or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for Series E Preferred Stock) may
Beneficially Own or Constructively Own shares of Series E Preferred Stock (or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for Series E Preferred Stock) in
excess of the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit, the Series E Ownership Limit,
or both such limits, but only to the extent necessary to facilitate such
public offering, private placement or private resale, and provided that the
restrictions contained in Section 9(b)(i) will not be violated following the
distribution by such underwriter, placement agent or initial purchaser of such
shares of Series E Preferred Stock.

 



 

(i) _Change in the Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit and the Series E Ownership
Limit_. Subject to Section 9(b)(i)(B), the Board of Directors may from time to
time increase or decrease the Series E Ownership Limit and the Aggregate Stock
Ownership Limit; _provided_ , _however_ , that any decreased Series E
Ownership Limit and/or Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit will not be effective
for any Person whose percentage ownership in Series E Preferred Stock is in
excess of such decreased Series E Ownership Limit and/or Aggregate Stock
Ownership Limit until such time as such Persons percentage of Series E
Preferred Stock equals or falls below the decreased Series E Ownership Limit
and/or Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit, but until such time as such Persons
percentage of Series E Preferred Stock falls below such decreased Series E
Ownership Limit and/or Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit any further acquisition
of Series E Preferred Stock will be in violation of the Series E Ownership
Limit and/or Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit and, _provided_ , _further_ ,
that any increased or decreased Series E Ownership

 



      
 

 



 

Limit and/or Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit would not allow five or fewer
Persons (taking into account all Excepted Holders) to Beneficially Own more
than 49.9% in value of the outstanding shares of Capital Stock.

(o) _Ambiguity_. In the case of an ambiguity in the application of any of the
provisions of this Section 9 of these Articles Supplementary, including any
definition contained in Section 9(a), the Board of Directors shall have the

respect to any situation based on the facts known to it.

 



 

Section 10. _Information Rights_. During any period in which the Corporation

Series E Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation will use its best
efforts to (i) transmit by mail (or other permissible means under the Exchange
Act) to all holders of Series E Preferred Stock, as their names and addresses
appear in the Corporations record books and without cost to such holders,
copies of the Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
that the Corporation would have been required to file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15(d) of
the Exchange Act if the Corporation were subject thereto (other than any
exhibits that would have been required), and (ii) promptly, upon request,
supply copies of such reports to any prospective holder of Series E Preferred
Stock. The Corporation will use its best efforts to mail (or otherwise
provide) the information to the holders of Series E Preferred Stock within 15
days after the respective dates by which a periodic report on Form 10-K or
Form 10-Q,

 



      
 

 



 

as the case may be, in respect of such information would have been required to
be filed with the SEC if it were subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, in each case, based on the dates on which the Corporation would
be required to file such periodic reports if it were a "non-accelerated filer"
within the meaning of the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 11. _Record Holders_. The Corporation and its transfer agent may deem
and treat the record holder of any shares of Series E Preferred Stock as the
true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation
nor its transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

 



 

Section 12. _No Maturity or Sinking Fund_. The Series E Preferred Stock shall
have no maturity date and the Corporation is not required to redeem the Series
E Preferred Stock at any time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Series E
Preferred Stock owned by a stockholder in excess of the Series E Ownership
Limit or Aggregate Stock Ownership Limit shall be subject to the provisions of
Section 5 and Section 9 of these Articles Supplementary. The Series E
Preferred Stock is not subject to any sinking fund.

 



 

Section 13. _Exclusion of Other Rights_. The Series E Preferred Stock shall
not have any preferences or other rights, voting powers, restrictions,
limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications or terms or
conditions of redemption other than expressly set forth in the Charter and
these Articles Supplementary.

 



 

Section 14. _Headings of Subdivisions_. The headings of the various
subdivisions hereof are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect
the interpretation of any of the provisions hereof.

 



 

Section 15. _Severability of Provisions_. If any preferences or other rights,
voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other
distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption of the
Series E Preferred Stock set forth in the Charter and these Articles
Supplementary are invalid, unlawful or incapable of being enforced by reason
of any rule of law or public policy, all other preferences or other rights,
voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other
distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption of Series E
Preferred Stock set forth in the Charter which can be given effect without the
invalid, unlawful or unenforceable provision thereof shall, nevertheless,
remain in full force and effect and no preferences or other rights, voting
powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions,
qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption of the Series E Preferred
Stock herein set forth shall be deemed dependent upon any other provision
thereof unless so expressed therein.

 



 

Section 16. _No Preemptive Rights_. No holder of shares of Series E Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to any preemptive rights to subscribe for or acquire

Corporation.
