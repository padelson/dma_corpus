disposition of such Claim. Following the Closing, Buyer shall not, and shall
not permit the Company or its Subsidiaries to, amend or modify their
certificate of incorporation, bylaws, limited liability company agreement or
other  organizational documents, as applicable, as in effect as of the date
hereof, except as required by applicable law, if the effect of such amendment
or modification would be to lessen in any material respect or otherwise
adversely affect in any material respect the indemnification rights of such
Indemnified Persons as provided therein, and Buyer shall cause the Company or
its Subsidiaries to advance expenses to each such Indemnified Person in
connection with any proceeding involving such  Corporate Indemnified Person
to the fullest extent permitted by law or the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws, limited liability company agreement or other organizational documents
of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, upon receipt of any
undertaking required by law or in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws,
limited liability company agreement or other organizational documents of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as of the date hereof. In the
event that  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then and in each
such case, proper provision shall be made so that the transferee of such
properties or assets shall assume the obligations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, under this paragraph 7.6.

directors' and officers' liability insurance policy, in form and content
reasonably acceptable to Buyer, which shall provide each Corporate Indemnified
Person serving prior to the Closing Date with coverage for six (6) years
following the Closing of not less than the existing coverage under, and on
other terms not materially less favorable to, the terms of Seller's current
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy. This paragraph 7.6 is 
intended to benefit each of the Corporate Indemnified Persons and their
respective heirs and personal representatives, each whom shall be entitled to
enforce the provisions hereof.

7.7 No Acquisitions. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall not, without the prior written
consent of Seller, and shall not permit its affiliates to, enter into any

the right to enter into only non-binding letters of intent, term sheets or
memoranda of interest) for, or consummate (i) a merger, tender offer,
recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, business
combination or consolidation, or any similar transaction with any entity, (ii)
a sale, lease exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other acquisition of the

except as contemplated by this Agreement.

  

7.8 Severance. Buyer agrees that it shall be responsible for and shall
pay all Retention Bonuses and all severance payments to be made by Company

provided, however, that Buyer shall report all transactions not in the
ordinary course of business occurring on the Closing Date after Buyer's
purchase of Company's stock on Buyer's U.S. federal income Tax Return to the
extent permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B). In
the case of each such Tax Return with respect to a Taxable period that 
includes the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare each such Tax Return in a
manner that is consistent with the past practice of the Company Group, except
as required by applicable Law, and at least fifteen (15) days prior to the due

review and approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Buyer and Seller shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any disagreements regarding any  such Tax Return prior to the due
date for filing. If applicable law does not permit a Company Group Member to
close its taxable year on the Closing Date or in any case in which a Tax is
assessed with respect to a taxable period that includes the Closing Date (but
does not begin or end on that day), any allocation of income or deductions
required to determine any Taxes attributable such period shall be made by
means of a closing of the books and records of the Company Group Member as
of  the close of the Closing Date, provided that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the
Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to
the number of days in each such period.

Agreement until the termination of this Agreement, Seller shall not, without

each case except for the Distribution or as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement.

(a) The period during which claims for indemnification by Buyer or by

Date and terminate at the date that is 24 months after the Closing Date (the "
_Claim Period_ "). The indemnification obligations under this  Article 11
shall terminate on the date that is 24 months after the Closing Date, except
for matters as to which Buyer or a Seller Indemnified Person has made a claim
for

  



  

 

    

       



     |  

43

    
---|--- 
   

  



  

 

  

   

indemnity on or before such date, which claim shall survive the expiration of
such period until such claim is finally resolved in accordance with the terms
of this Article 11 and the Escrow Agreement and any obligations with respect
thereto are fully satisfied.

  

(b) Buyer may not recover from the Escrow Amount in respect of any claim
for indemnification unless and until indemnifiable Losses of Buyer have been
incurred, paid or properly accrued in an aggregate amount greater than
$375,000 (the " _Indemnification Deductible_ "). Once the  Indemnification
Deductible has been exceeded, Buyer shall be entitled to recover from the
Escrow Amount only indemnifiable Losses in excess of the Indemnification
Deductible.

  

(c) The Seller Indemnified Persons may not recover from Buyer in respect
of any claim for indemnification, other than claims for Taxes attributable to
(i) the operation of the Company Group's business after the Closing Date or
(ii) actions or transactions occurring on the Closing Date (after the
consummation of the Closing) other  than in the ordinary course of business,
unless and until indemnifiable Losses have been incurred, paid or properly
accrued in an aggregate amount greater than the Indemnification Deductible.
Once the Indemnification Deductible has been exceeded, the Seller Indemnified
Persons shall be entitled to recover from Buyer only indemnifiable Losses in
excess of the Indemnification Deductible.

  

(d) Solely for purposes of this Article 11 and the determination of the

_i.e._ , the representations and warranties in Article 4 shall be read as
though the terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" have been deleted).

  

(e) Neither Buyer nor any Seller Indemnified Person shall have any
indemnification rights under this Article 11 in respect of any claim:

  

(i) for any single Loss that is less than $25,000, such claims being
ignored for purposes of calculating Losses under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that a series of related Losses arising out of the same facts
and  events shall be deemed to constitute a single Loss;

  

(ii) to the extent that any provision or reserve in respect of the
matter giving rise to such claim has been provided for in the Financial
Statements, which provision or reserve remains in effect or has not been
released as of the close of business on the day preceding the Closing Date;

  

(iii) to the extent that the matter giving rise to such claim resulted in
an adjustment to the Purchase Price based on the Actual Net Working Capital;

  

(iv) to the extent that such claim relates to any Loss for which Buyer or
such Seller Indemnified Person is insured and actually recovers thereunder,
but only to the extent of net insurance proceeds actually recovered; and

  

(v) to the extent that such claim relates to any Loss for which Buyer or
any Seller Indemnified Person, as applicable, collects a recovery from any
third party, but

  



  

 

    

       



     |  

44

    
---|--- 
   

  



  

 

  

   

only to the extent of collections actually received. Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all of their respective remedies
against applicable insurers, third parties, indemnitors or contributors prior
to seeking indemnification hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that  the
foregoing limitation shall not prevent Buyer from providing notice of any
Losses to Seller or the Seller Representative pursuant to this Article 11;
_provided_ , further, that in the event Buyer cease to pursue, or determine
that it would not be commercially reasonable to pursue, all of its remedies
against such insurers, third parties, indemnitors or contributors, Buyer shall
assign to Seller and Seller Representative, upon the  request of Seller or
Seller Representative, all of the rights of Buyer and the Company Group to
pursue their respective remedies against such insurers, third parties,
indemnitors or contributors. If Buyer or the Company Group actually receives
any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other person
alleged to be responsible for any Losses, subsequent to an indemnification
payment by the Escrow Amount, then Buyer shall promptly reimburse (or cause
the Company Group to  reimburse) the Escrow Amount for any payment actually
made or expense incurred by Seller or the Seller Representative in connection
with providing such indemnification payment up to the actual amount received
by Buyer, net of any unindemnified expenses incurred by Buyer in collecting
such amount.

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i)
claims for indemnification arising out of a breach by either party of its
obligations under paragraph 2.1(e), or paragraphs 11.3(ii) or 11.4(ii) of this
Agreement, (ii) the payment by Buyer of any amounts due pursuant to this
Agreement (including pursuant to  paragraphs 1.1, 1.4, 1.6, 2.1 and 3.1),
(iii) the obligations of Buyer pursuant to the Assumption and Indemnification
Agreement, (iv) claims by Seller for indemnification arising out of Buyer's
breach of paragraph 5.7, or (v) claims attributable to or arising out of the
Excluded Corporations or the distribution by Company of the stock of the
Excluded Corporations, shall not be subject to the various limitations on
indemnification set forth in this paragraph  11.5.

  

11.6 Exclusive Remedy. Except for claims based on fraud, recovery from the
Escrow Amount in accordance with this Article 11 and the Escrow Agreement
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing Date for any Losses
incurred by Buyer arising out of, related to or otherwise by virtue of any
breach or claim in connection with this  Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby, regardless of the cause of action. Buyer shall not be
entitled to make any claim directly against Seller, the Seller Representative
or any current or former holder of capital stock of Seller after the Closing
Date for any Losses arising out of, related to or otherwise by virtue of any
breach or claim in connection with this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby, regardless of the cause of action, except for claims
based on  fraud.

11.7

     |  

Procedure for Indemnification.

    
---|---|--- 
   

  

(a) If Buyer desires to seek indemnification under this Article 11,
Buyer shall give written notice to the Escrow Agent, Seller and the Seller
Representative specifying the basis on which indemnification is sought in
reasonable detail and such other information known to Buyer regarding the
indemnification claim, promptly, but in no event later than  10 business
days, after Buyer learns of the claim or proceeding; _provided_ that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the rights to indemnification
hereunder if Buyer uses its best efforts to mitigate

  



  

 

    

       



     |  

45

    
---|--- 
   

  



  

 

  

   

damages, except to the extent Seller, the Seller Representative or the Escrow
Amount is actually prejudiced.

  

(b) A Seller Indemnified Person seeking indemnification under paragraph
11.4 shall give written notice to Buyer specifying the basis on which
indemnification is sought in reasonable detail and such other information
known to such Seller Indemnified Person regarding the indemnification claim,
promptly, but in no event later than 10 business days,  after such Seller
Indemnified Person learns of the claim or proceeding; _provided_ that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the rights to indemnification
hereunder if such Seller Indemnified Person uses its best efforts to mitigate
damages, except to the extent Buyer is actually prejudiced.

  

(c) With respect to any third-party claims or proceedings as to which
Buyer or a Seller Indemnified Person, as the case may be (each, a " _Claimant_
"), is seeking indemnification hereunder, Buyer, in the case of an
indemnification claim brought by a Seller Indemnified Person and Seller and 
the Seller Representative, in the case of an indemnification claim brought by
Buyer against the Escrow Amount (each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller
and Seller Representative, on the other hand, in such cases, the "
_Counterparty_ ") shall have the right to select and employ counsel of its own
choosing reasonably satisfactory to the Claimant to defend against any such
claim or proceeding, to assume control of the defense of  such claim or
proceeding, and to compromise, settle or otherwise dispose of the same, if the
Counterparty deems it advisable to do so, all at the expense of the
Counterparty (or the Escrow Amount in the case of Seller and the Seller
Representative); _provided_ , that the Counterparty uses commercially
reasonable efforts to conduct the defense actively and diligently and in a
manner intended to minimize the risk of the Claimant becoming  subject to any
liability for any other material matter. Further, the Counterparty shall not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect any third-party claim without the prior written
consent of the Claimant unless such judgment, compromise or settlement (i)
provides for the payment by Buyer or from the Escrow Amount, as applicable, of
money as sole relief for the third-party claimant, (ii) results in the full
and general  release of Buyer or the Seller Indemnified Persons, as
applicable, from all liabilities arising or relating to, or in connection
with, the third-party claim, and (iii) involves no finding or admission of any
violation of laws, rules or regulations or the rights of any person and has no
effect on any other claims that may be made against the Claimant. The Claimant
may elect to participate in the defense of any such third party claim, and
may, at its sole expense, retain separate  counsel in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if in the reasonable opinion of the Claimant,
any such claim or the litigation or resolution of any such claim involves an
issue or matter that could have a material adverse effect on the on the
business, operations, condition (financial or otherwise), assets or earnings
of the Claimant, the Claimant shall have the right to control the defense or
settlement of any such claim or demand and its reasonable costs and expenses 
shall be included as part of the indemnifiable Losses. The Claimant shall not
settle or compromise any such third party claim without the prior written
consent of the Counterparty, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
The parties will fully cooperate in any such action, and shall make available
to each other any books or records useful for the defense of any such claim or
proceeding.

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any Medicare or tax
audit or investigation or other third-party claim involving the conduct of the
Business prior to Closing, Seller and the Seller Representative shall maintain
the right, even if Buyer has taken control of

  



  

 

    

       



     |  

46

    
---|--- 
   

  



  

 

  

   

the defense of such matter pursuant to paragraph 11.7(c), to remain actively
and directly involved in responding to any information requests, interacting
with the third-party claimant(s) and/or investigator(s), formulating and
implementing any necessary litigation strategy, and otherwise participating in
the defense of any claim that may result in recovery by Buyer from and against
the Escrow  Amount.

  

11.8 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. All payments made from the Escrow
Amount or Buyer, to or for the benefit of Buyer or a Seller Indemnified
Person, as applicable, pursuant to this Article 11 shall be treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for tax purposes, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, and such agreed treatment  shall govern for purposes of this
Agreement.

  

**Article 12** 

  

**Other Provisions**

  

12.1 Cooperation in Litigation. From and after the Closing Date, Seller
and Seller Representative shall fully cooperate with Buyer and Company Group

incurred in providing such cooperation (including legal fees and
disbursements) by Seller or Seller Representative providing such cooperation

12.11 Announcements. Except as and to the extent required by applicable law,
without the prior written consent of the other party, neither Seller or the
Seller Representative, on the one hand, nor Buyer, on the other hand, shall,
and each will direct its respective representatives not to make, directly or
indirectly, any public comment, statement or  communication with respect to,
or otherwise disclose or to permit the disclosure of, the terms of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. If any party, in the opinion of
outside legal counsel to such party, is required by Law or the rules of any
exchange or the listing rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market or any other
applicable securities market, to make any such disclosure, such party must
first provide the other party the content of the proposed disclosure, the

situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the  final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to limit the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid

as so modified.

  

12.13 Specific Performance. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the

of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each party agrees that the other parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or other  equitable relief to prevent
breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this
Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in addition to any other remedy
to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity.

  

12.14 Confidentiality. The parties shall adhere to the terms and conditions
of that certain Confidentiality Agreement dated December 13, 2007 by and

(iii) National Home  Care, Inc., a New York corporation, (iv) Patient Care,
Inc. - Illinois, an Illinois Corporation, (v) Patient Care Medical Services,

corporation, (xii) Patient Care Pennsylvania, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
(xiii) Patient Care New Jersey, Inc., a Delaware corporation (collectively the
" _Indemnified Entities_ " and each an " _Indemnified Entity_ "), and (xiv)
Almost Family, Inc., a Delaware corporation  (" _Buyer_ ")

  



  

WHEREAS, Buyer, Seller and National Home Care, Inc., solely in its capacity as
Seller Representative, are parties to the Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of
June 18, 2008 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "). Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase 
Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, in connection with the Purchase Agreement, Buyer desires to assume
the Indemnified Entities' obligations and liabilities under or with respect to
any facts, events or occurrences, or any claims asserted against one or more
Indemnified Entities, arising from or relating to any accident, bodily injury
and/or death of an employee of an Indemnified Entity arising out of or 
occurring in the course of an employee's employment with an Indemnified Entity
at any time through the Closing Date, regardless of whether those facts,
events, occurrences or claims were reported or made before or after the
Closing Date and regardless of whether the Workers' Compensation Claim is
covered by the Policy (the " _Workers ' Compensation Claims_"), and provide
indemnification to the Indemnified  Entities in connection with such Workers'
Compensation Claims, whether or not covered by the Policy (as defined below),
in accordance with the terms hereof;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company owns the Workers Compensation and Employers Liability
Insurance Policy (the " _Policy_ ") set forth on _Schedule A_ hereto, issued
by Zurich American Insurance Company (the " _Insurer_ ") and  the Company and
its affiliates (including the Indemnified Entities) are or have been the Named
Insured on the Policy;

  



  

NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

  



  

1. Assumption of Liabilities. (a) In connection with, and as of the time of, the Closing, Buyer shall assume all obligations and liabilities of the Indemnified Entities under or with respect to any Workers' Compensation Claims, regardless of whether the Workers' Compensation Claim was made or reported to an Indemnified  Entity before or after the Closing Date and regardless of whether the Workers' Compensation Claim is covered by the Policy.

  

(b) Buyer shall fully defend all Workers' Compensation Claims at Buyer's
expense and shall have the right to compromise, settle or otherwise dispose of
the same, if Buyer

  



  

   

 

  

Assumption and Indemnification Agreement - Page 2

  

 

  



  

deems it advisable to do so; provided, that Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to conduct the defense actively and diligently and in a
manner intended to minimize the risk of the Indemnified Entities becoming
subject to any liability for any other material matter. Further, Buyer shall
not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect any  Workers' Compensation Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Entities unless such judgment, compromise
or settlement (i) provides for the payment by Buyer of money as sole relief
for the third-party claimant, (ii) results in the full and general release of
the Indemnified Entities from all liabilities arising or relating to, or in
connection with, the Workers' Compensation Claim, and (iii) involves no
finding or admission of any violation of  laws, rules or regulations or the
rights of any person and has no effect on any other Workers' Compensation
Claims that may be made against the Indemnified Entities. The Indemnified
Entities shall make available to Buyer any books or records useful for the
defense of any Workers' Compensation Claim at the Closing. The Indemnified
Parties shall provide notice promptly to Buyer of any Workers' Compensation
Claims received by them from and after the Closing  Date.

  

2. Indemnification for Workers' Compensation Claims. (a) As of and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to fully defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Entities from, against and in respect of, and reimburse such Indemnified Entity, any Losses incurred by such Indemnified Entity resulting from, arising out of or in  connection with Workers' Compensation Claims, regardless of whether the Workers' Compensation Claim was made or reported to an Indemnified Entity before or after the Closing Date and regardless of whether the Workers' Compensation Claim is covered by the Policy.

  

(b) Upon receiving written notice of a claim for indemnification from
any Indemnified Entity with respect to a Workers' Compensation Claim, Buyer
shall promptly (but in no event after 30 days of receipt of such notice)
reimburse, or cause the Indemnified Entity to be reimbursed for, or advance,
as directed by the Indemnified Entity, all  Losses incurred by the
Indemnified Entity in connection with the Workers' Compensation Claim.

  

3. Return of Letters of Credit. (a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that in connection with, and as required by, the terms and conditions of the Policy, Seller arranged for its lenders (the " _Bank_ ") to issue letters of credit for the benefit of Insurer as security for the  obligations of Company under the Policy (the " _Letters of Credit_ "). Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer will not succeed to any rights in the Letters of Credit pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement or the Purchase Agreement.

  

(b) In connection with, and as of the time of, the Closing, Buyer shall
(i) deposit or cause to be deposited with the Insurer substitute letters of
credit for the benefit of Insurer as security for the obligations of Company
under the Policy, and (ii) execute and deliver all agreements, certificates
and documents necessary or  appropriate and take all steps required to
arrange for the Insurer to return and surrender the Letters of Credit to
Seller or the Bank for cancellation.

  

4. Cooperation; Execution of Documents. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully, execute all documents necessary and take all steps required to effectuate the terms of this Agreement.

effective to modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or any
rights or obligations of any party under or by reason of this Agreement.

(a) The Escrow Agent shall have only those duties as are specifically
and expressly provided herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in
nature, and no other duties shall be implied. The Escrow Agent shall neither
be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of, nor have any
requirements to comply with, the terms and conditions of any  other
agreement, instrument or document between the Parties, in connection herewith,
if any, including without limitation the Purchase Agreement (the " _Underlying
Agreement_ "), nor shall the Escrow Agent be required to determine if any
person or entity has complied with any such agreements, nor shall any
additional obligations of the Escrow Agent be inferred from the terms of such
agreements, even though reference thereto may  be made in this Escrow
Agreement. In the event of any conflict relating to the rights and duties of
Escrow Agent between the terms and provisions of this Escrow Agreement, those
of the Underlying Agreement, any schedule or exhibit attached to the Escrow
Agreement, or any other agreement among the Parties, the terms and conditions
of this Escrow Agreement shall control. The Escrow Agent may rely upon and
shall not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon any written
notice,  document, instruction or request furnished to it hereunder and
believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the
proper Party or Parties without inquiry and without requiring substantiating
evidence of any kind. The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into
or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document, notice,
instruction or request. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to solicit any
payments which may be due it or the Fund,  including, without limitation, the
Escrow Deposit,nor shall the Escrow Agent have any duty or obligation to
confirm or verify the accuracy or correctness of any amounts deposited with it

hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall have no duty or obligation to make any
calculations of any kind hereunder.

  



  

(b) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered
or omitted to be taken by it except to the extent that a final adjudication of
a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Escrow Agent's gross
negligence or willful misconduct was the primary cause of any loss to either
Party. The Escrow Agent may execute any of  its powers and perform any of its
duties hereunder directly or through agents or attorneys, and shall be liable
only for its gross negligence or willful misconduct (as finally adjudicated in
a court of competent jurisdiction), including in the selection of any such
agent or attorney. The Escrow Agent may consult with counsel, accountants and
other skilled persons to be selected and retained by it. The Escrow Agent
shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken  by
it in accordance with, or in reliance upon, the advice or opinion of any such
counsel, accountants or other skilled persons. In the event that the Escrow
Agent shall be uncertain or believe there is some ambiguity as to its duties
or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any
party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of
this Escrow Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action
and its sole obligation  shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow
until it shall be given a direction in writing by the Parties which eliminates
such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of Escrow Agent or by a
final and non-appealable order or judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Parties agree to pursue any redress or recourse in
connection with any dispute without making the Escrow Agent a party to the
same. Anything in this Escrow Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in 
no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, incidental, punitive,
indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but
not limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

resignation, the Escrow Agent may petition any court of competent jurisdiction
for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or for other appropriate
relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon all of the

notice period expires shall be to hold the Fund (without any obligation to
reinvest the same) and to deliver the same to a designated substitute escrow

Notwithstanding the above, in the case of communications delivered to the
Escrow Agent pursuant to (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 11, such
communications shall be deemed to have

  



  

 

  

8

  



  

 

  

   

been given on the date received by an officer of the Escrow Agent or any
employee of the Escrow Agent who reports directly to any such officer at the
above-referenced office. In the event that the Escrow Agent, in its sole
discretion, shall determine that an emergency exists, the Escrow Agent may use
such other means of communication as the Escrow Agent deems appropriate.
"Business Day" shall  mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or any other
day on which the Escrow Agent located at the notice address set forth above is
authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed.

  



  

12. **Security Procedures.** In the event funds transfer instructions are given (other than in writing at the time of execution of this Escrow Agreement), whether in writing, by facsimile or otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to  the person or persons designated on schedule 1 hereto (" _Schedule 1_ "), and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated. Each funds transfer instruction shall be executed by an authorized signatory, a list of such authorized signatories is set forth on Schedule 1. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in a writing actually  received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of the authorized representatives identified in Schedule 1, the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more of the Parties' executive officers, (" _Executive Officers_ "), as the case may be, which shall include the titles of General Counsel, President and/or  Chief Executive Officer, as the Escrow Agent may select. Such "Executive Officer" shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed incumbency certificate, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer. The Escrow Agent and the beneficiary's bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by the Parties to identify (a) the beneficiary, (b) the  beneficiary's bank, or (c) an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply any of the escrowed funds for any payment order it executes using any such identifying number, even when its use may result in a person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiary's bank or an intermediary bank designated. The Parties acknowledge that these security procedures are commercially reasonable.

  



  

13. **Compliance with Court Orders.** In the event that any escrow property shall be attached, garnished or levied upon by any court order, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court order affecting  the property deposited under this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with all writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, which it is advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction, and in the event that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person, entity,  firm or corporation, by reason of such compliance notwithstanding such writ, order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

  



  

14. **Miscellaneous.** The provisions of this Escrow Agreement may be waived, altered, amended or supplemented, in whole or in part, only by a writing signed by the Escrow Agent and the Parties. Neither this Escrow Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder may be assigned in whole or in part by the  Escrow Agent or any Party, except as provided in

Section 6, without the prior consent of the Escrow Agent. This Escrow
Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of
Delaware. Each Party irrevocably waives any objection on the grounds of venue,
forum non-conveniens or any similar grounds and irrevocably consents to
service of process by mail or in any other manner permitted by applicable law
and consents to the  jurisdiction of the courts located in the State of
Delaware. The Parties further hereby waive any right to a trial by jury with
respect to any lawsuit or judicial proceeding arising or relating to this
Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Party shall not be liable to any Party for losses
due to, or if it is unable to perform its obligations under the terms of this
Escrow Agreement because of, acts of God, fire, war, terrorism, floods,
strikes, electrical outages, equipment or transmission  failure, or other
causes reasonably beyond its control. This Escrow Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all
of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. All signatures
of the Escrow Agent and the Parties to this Escrow Agreement may be
transmitted by facsimile, and such facsimile will, for all purposes, be deemed
to be the original signature of such party whose signature it reproduces, and
will be  binding upon such party. If any provision of this Escrow Agreement
is determined to be prohibited or unenforceable by reason of any applicable
law of a jurisdiction, then such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions thereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in such jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provisions in any other  jurisdiction. A person who is not
a party to this Agreement shall have no right to enforce any term of this
Agreement. The Parties represent, warrant and covenant that each document,
notice, instruction or request provided by such Party to Escrow Agent shall
comply with applicable laws and regulations. Where, however, the conflicting
provisions of any such applicable law may be waived, they are hereby
irrevocably waived by the Parties hereto to the fullest extent permitted by
law, to  the end that this Escrow Agreement shall be enforced as written.
Except as expressly provided in Section 8 above, nothing in this Escrow
Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be construed to give to any
person or entity other than the Escrow Agent and the Parties any legal or
equitable right, remedy, interest or claim under or in respect of this Escrow
Agreement or any funds escrowed hereunder.

[FORM OF GOODWIN PROCTER LLP OPINION LETTER]

  



  

To Almost Family, Inc.

  

9510 Ormsby Station Road, Suite 300

  

Louisville, Kentucky 40223

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

We have acted as counsel to PCI Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Seller_ "), in connection with the proposed purchase by Almost Family, Inc.
(the " _Buyer_ ") of the Shares pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement dated
as of June 18, 2008 (the  " _Stock Purchase Agreement_ ") by and among the
Buyer, Seller and National Home Care, Inc., a New York corporation solely in
its capacity as the Seller Representative. We are furnishing this opinion
letter to you pursuant to paragraph 3.1(xiv) of the Stock Purchase Agreement.
Capitalized terms that are defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement and not
otherwise defined in this opinion letter are used in this opinion letter as 
so defined.

  

We have reviewed such documents and made such examination of law as we have
deemed appropriate to give the opinions expressed below. We have relied,
without independent verification, on certificates of public officials and, as
to matters of fact material to the opinions set forth below, on
representations in the Stock Purchase Agreement and certificates of officers
of the  Seller.

  

The opinions set forth below are limited to Massachusetts law, the Delaware
General Corporation Law and the federal law of the United States. We note the
Stock Purchase Agreement provides that it is to be governed by Delaware law.
The opinions in paragraph 2 below regarding the validity, binding effect and
enforceability of the Stock Purchase Agreement are given as though the  Stock
Purchase Agreement were governed by the internal law of Massachusetts.

  

Based upon the foregoing and subject to the additional qualifications set
forth below, we are of the opinion that:

  

**•** The Seller has the corporate power to execute and deliver the
Stock Purchase Agreement and perform its obligations thereunder.

  

**•** The Stock Purchase Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Seller and constitutes its valid and binding
obligation enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.

  

The opinions expressed above are subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general
application affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and to general
principles of equity.

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

This opinion letter and the opinions it contains shall be interpreted in
accordance with the Legal Opinion Principles issued by the Committee on Legal
Opinions of the American Bar Association's Business Law Section as published
in 53 _Business Lawyer_ 831 (May 1998).

  

This opinion letter is being furnished only to you for your use solely in
connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, and neither it nor the opinions it contains may be relied on for any
other purpose or by anyone else.

  

       

 Very truly yours,

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

We have acted as counsel to Almost Family, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "
_Buyer_ "), in connection with the proposed purchase by the Buyer from PCI
Holdings Corp. (the " _Seller_ ") of the Shares pursuant to the Stock Purchase
Agreement dated as  of June 18, 2008 (the " _Stock Purchase Agreement_ ") by
and among the Buyer, Seller and [National Home Care, Inc., a New York
corporation] solely in its capacity as the Seller Representative. We are
furnishing this opinion letter to you pursuant to paragraph 3.1[(xv)] of the
Stock Purchase Agreement. Capitalized terms that are defined in the Stock
Purchase Agreement and not otherwise defined in this opinion letter are used 
in this opinion letter as so defined.

  

We have reviewed such documents and made such examination of law as we have
deemed appropriate to give the opinions expressed below. We have relied,
without independent verification, on certificates of public officials and, as
to matters of fact material to the opinions set forth below, on
representations in the Stock Purchase Agreement and certificates of officers
of  the Buyer.

  

The opinions set forth below are limited to Kentucky law, the Delaware General
Corporation Law and the federal law of the United States. We note the Stock
Purchase Agreement provides that it is to be governed by Delaware law. The
opinions in paragraph 2 below regarding the validity, binding effect and
enforceability of the Stock Purchase Agreement are given as  though the Stock
Purchase Agreement were governed by the internal law of the Commonwealth of
Kentucky.

  

Based upon the foregoing and subject to the additional qualifications set
forth below, we are of the opinion that:

  

**•** The Buyer has the corporate power to execute and deliver the
Stock Purchase Agreement and perform its obligations thereunder.

  

**•** The Stock Purchase Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Buyer and constitutes its valid and binding
obligation enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.

  

The opinions expressed above are subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general
application affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and to general
principles of equity.

  



  

 

  



  

 

  

   

This opinion letter and the opinions it contains shall be interpreted in
accordance with the Legal Opinion Principles issued by the Committee on Legal
Opinions of the American Bar Association's Business Law Section as published
in 53 _Business Lawyer_ 831 (May 1998).

  

This opinion letter is being furnished only to you for your use solely in
connection with the Stock Purchase Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby, and neither it nor the opinions it contains may be relied on for any
other purpose or by anyone else.

  

 Very truly yours,
