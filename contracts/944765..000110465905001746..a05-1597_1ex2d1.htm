thereof, at the holders election, to Merge Newco in exchange for that number
of fully paid and non-assessable Merge Common Shares or to Matsub in exchange
for that number of fully paid and non-assessable Exchangeable Shares, as the
case may be, equal to the Exchange Ratio, and the name of each such holder of
Cedara Common Shares will be removed from the register of holders of Cedara
Common Shares and added to the register of holders of Merge Common Shares or
Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be, and Merge Newco or Matsub, as the
case may be, will be recorded as the registered holder of such Cedara Common
Shares so exchanged and will be deemed to be the legal and beneficial owner
thereof; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, holders of Cedara
Common Shares, who are not residents of Canada for the purposes of the
_Income Tax Act_ (Canada)

  



  

12   

     
   

  



  

will not be entitled to elect to receive Exchangeable Shares, and any such
election otherwise made by any such holder shall be and be deemed to be an
election to transfer their shares to Merge Newco and to receive Merge Common
Shares;

  



  

(b) each Cedara Common Share in respect of which no election has been made by
the holder thereof, or in respect of which an effective election has not been
made (other than (x) Cedara Common Shares held by Dissenting Shareholders who
are ultimately entitled to be paid the fair value of Cedara Common Shares
held by them and (y) Cedara Common Shares held by Merge or any Subsidiary or
affiliate thereof which shall not be exchanged under the Arrangement and
shall remain outstanding as Cedara Common Shares held by Merge or any
Subsidiary or affiliate thereof) (i) in the case of a holder of a Cedara
Common Share whose address as shown in the register of Cedara Common Shares
is in Canada, will be deemed to be an Exchangeable Elected Share and will be
transferred by the holder thereof, without any act or formality on its part,
to Matsub in exchange for that number of fully paid and non-assessable
Exchangeable Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio, and the name of each such
holder of a Cedara Common Share will be removed from the register of holders
of Cedara Common Shares and added to the register of holders of Exchangeable
Shares and Matsub will be recorded as the registered holder of such Cedara
Common Share so exchanged and will be deemed to be legal and beneficial owner
of such Cedara Common Share, and (ii) in the case of a holder of a Cedara
Common Share whose address as shown in the register of Cedara Common Shares
is not in Canada, will be deemed not to be an Exchangeable Elected Share and
will be transferred by the holder thereof, without any act or formality on
its part, to Merge Newco in exchange for that number of fully paid and non-
assessable Merge Shares equal to the Exchange Ratio, and the name of each
such holder of a Cedara Common Share will be removed from the register of
holders of Cedara Common Shares and added to the register of holders of Merge
Shares and Merge Newco will be recorded as the registered holder of such
Cedara Common Share so exchanged and will be deemed to be the legal and
beneficial owner of such Cedara Common Share;

  



  

(c) each Cedara Option shall be exchanged for an option (a "
**Replacement Option** ") to purchase that number of Merge Common Shares
equal to the number of Cedara Common Shares subject to such Cedara Option
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share),
with the exercise price thereof being adjusted by dividing the exercise price
of the Cedara Option by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent) and then multiplying the result by the noon spot exchange rate on the
Effective Date for Canadian dollars to United States dollars as reported by
the Bank of Canada or, in the event such spot exchange rate is not available,
such spot exchange rate on such date as may be deemed by the Board of
Directors of Merge to be appropriate for such purpose. Except as set forth
in the preceding sentence and in Schedule G attached hereto, the terms
and conditions applicable to each Replacement Option shall be identical to
the terms and provisions of the Cedara Option for which it was exchanged and

  



  

13   

     
   

  



  

the rights of the holder of each such Replacement Option shall be identical
to those possessed by the holder of the Cedara Option for which it was
exchanged.

  



  

 **2.5** Joint Proxy Statement / Circular

  

 ** **

  

 **As promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, (i) Merge and Cedara shall prepare the Circular and all other
required documents prepared in conformity with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the 1933 Act, the Exchange Act and other applicable Laws in
connection with the Arrangement and the Merge Matters, and (ii) Merge shall
file the Circular with the SEC as a preliminary proxy statement on Schedule
14A promulgated under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"**Exchange Act") to be sent to each holder of Merge Common Shares relating
to the Merge Meeting.  As promptly as practicable after the SEC shall have
definitively indicated that it has no further comments on the Circular,
Cedara shall cause the Circular and other documentation required in
connection with the Cedara Meeting to be sent to each holder of Cedara Common
Shares and Cedara Options and filed as required by the Interim Order and
applicable Laws and Merge shall mail the Circular and other documentation
required in connection with the Merge Meeting to each holder of Merge Common
Shares.

  

 ** **

  

 **2.6** Securities Compliance

  

 ** **

  

(a) Merge shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain all orders required from
the applicable Canadian securities authorities to permit the issuance and
first resale of (a) the Exchangeable Shares and Merge Common Shares issued
pursuant to the Arrangement, (b) the Merge Common Shares issued upon exchange
of the Exchangeable Shares from time to time and (c) the Merge Common Shares
issued from time to time upon the exercise of the Replacement Options, in
each case without qualification with or approval of or the filing of any
prospectus or similar document, or the taking of any proceeding with, or the
obtaining of any further order, ruling or consent from, any Governmental
Entity or regulatory authority under any Canadian federal, provincial or
territorial securities or other Laws or pursuant to the rules and regulations
of any regulatory authority administering such Laws, or the fulfillment of
any other legal requirement in any such jurisdiction (other than, with
respect to such first resales, any restrictions on transfer by reason of,
among other things, a holder being a "control person" of Merge or Cedara for
purposes of Canadian federal, provincial or territorial securities Laws).

  



  

(b) As promptly as practicable (but no later than 30 days) after the
Effective Date, Merge shall prepare and file a registration statement on Form
S-3 (or other applicable form) (the " **Form S-3** "), in order to register
under the 1933 Act the Merge Common Shares to be issued from time to time
after the Effective Time upon exchange of the Exchangeable Shares. Merge
shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Form S-3 to become effective and to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration for the period that the
Exchangeable Shares remain outstanding. Merge does not undertake to file a
separate registration statement to register the

  



  

14   

     
   

  



  

sale of Merge Common Shares by affiliates of Cedara pursuant to Rule 145
promulgated under the 1933 Act.

  



  

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, Merge shall file
either a registration statement on Form S-8 (or other applicable form) or an
amendment to its existing registration statement on Form S-8 (the **"Form
S-8"** ) in order to register under the 1933 Act those Merge Common Shares to
be issued from time to time after the Effective Time upon the exercise of the
Replacement Options.

  



  

(d) Cedara and Merge shall take all such steps as may be required to cause
the transactions contemplated by Article 2 and any other dispositions
of Cedara equity securities and/or acquisitions of Merge equity
securities (including, in each case derivative securities) in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby by any individual who
is a director or officer of Cedara, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

  



  

 **2.7** Preparation of Filings

  

 ** **

  

(a) Merge and Cedara shall cooperate in:

  



  

(i) the preparation of any application for the orders and the preparation of
any required registration statements and any other documents reasonably
deemed by Merge or Cedara to be necessary to discharge their respective
obligations under United States and Canadian federal, provincial, territorial
or state securities Laws in connection with the Arrangement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby;

  



  

(ii) the taking of all such action as may be required under any applicable
United States and Canadian federal, provincial, territorial or state
securities Laws (including "blue sky laws") in connection with the issuance
of the Exchangeable Shares and the Merge Common Shares in connection with the
Arrangement or the exercise of the Replacement Options; provided, however,
that with respect to the United States "blue sky" and Canadian provincial
qualifications neither Merge nor Cedara shall be required to register or
qualify as a foreign corporation or to take any action that would subject it
to service of process in any jurisdiction where such entity is not now so
subject, except as to matters and transactions arising solely from the offer
and sale of the Exchangeable Shares and the Merge Common Shares; and

  



  

(iii) the taking of all such action as may be required under the OBCA, the
1933 Act, the Exchange Act and the laws of the State of Wisconsin in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan
of Arrangement.

  



  

15   

     
   

  



  

(b) Each of Merge and Cedara shall furnish to the other all such information
concerning it and its shareholders as may be required (and, in the case of
its shareholders, available to it) for the effectuation of the actions
described in sections 2.5 and 2.6 and the foregoing provisions of this
section 2.7, and each covenants that no information furnished by it (to its
knowledge in the case of information concerning its shareholders) in
connection with such actions or otherwise in connection with the consummation
of the Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated in any such document or necessary in
order to make any information so furnished for use in any such document not
misleading in the light of the circumstances in which it is furnished.
 Unless Merge consents, the financial statements of Cedara for the
year ended June 30, 2004 (the " **Cedara 2004 Financial Statements** ") to be
included in the Circular or any other document filed pursuant to this Article
II shall not contain any changes from the Cedara 2004 Financial Statements
which are the subject of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.1(g) which, if the changes had been known at the time of
certification, would have prohibited the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer of Cedara from making the certification under Section 302
of SOX relating to the financial statements actually filed at such time and
not reflecting such changes, and unless Cedara consents, the financial
statements of Merge for the year ended December 31, 2003 (the " **Merge 2003
Financial Statements** ") to be included in the Circular or any other
document filed pursuant to this Article II shall not contain any changes from
the Merge 2003 Financial Statements which are the subject of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.2(g) which, if the
changes had been known at the time of certification, would have prohibited
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Merge from making
the certification under Section 302 of SOX relating to the financial
statements actually filed at such time and not reflecting such changes.

  



  

(c) Merge and Cedara shall each promptly notify the other if at any time
before or after the Effective Time it becomes aware that the Circular or an
application for an order or a registration statement described in section 2.6
contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
contained therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which they
are made, or that otherwise requires an amendment or supplement to the
Circular or such application or registration statement. In any such event,
Merge and Cedara shall cooperate in the preparation of a supplement or
amendment to the Circular or such other document, as required and as the case
may be, and, if required, shall cause the same to be distributed to
shareholders of Merge or Cedara and/or filed with the relevant securities
regulatory authorities.

  



  

(d) Cedara shall ensure that the Circular complies with all applicable Laws
and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, that the Circular does
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to

  



  

16   

     
   

  



  

be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein not
misleading in light of the circumstances in which they are made (other than
with respect to any information relating to and provided by the Merge Parties
or any third party that is not an affiliate of Cedara). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Cedara shall ensure that the Circular provides
holders of Cedara Common Shares with information in sufficient detail to
permit them to form a reasoned judgment concerning the matters to be placed
before them at Cedara Meeting and Merge shall provide all information
regarding it necessary to do so.

  



  

(e) Merge shall ensure that the Circular, the Form S-3 and the Form S-8
comply with all applicable Laws and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, that such documents do not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading in light
of the circumstances in which they are made (other than with respect to any
information relating to and provided by Cedara or any third party that is not
an affiliate of Merge) and Cedara shall provide all information regarding it
necessary to do so.

  



  

 **ARTICLE 3 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**

  

 ** **

  

 **3.1** Representations and Warranties of Cedara

  

 ** **

  

Cedara represents and warrants to and in favour of the Merge Parties
as follows, subject to such exceptions as are specifically disclosed in
writing in the Cedara Disclosure Letter (each of which exceptions shall
indicate the paragraph or subparagraph of this Section 3.1 to which it
applies, and which shall only qualify such indicated paragraph or
subparagraph), and acknowledges that the Merge Parties are relying upon such
representations and warranties in connection with the matters contemplated by
this Agreement:

  



  

(a) _Organization_.

  



  

(i) Each of Cedara and the Cedara Material Subsidiaries has been duly
incorporated or formed under all applicable Laws, is validly subsisting and
has full corporate or legal power and authority to own its properties and
conduct its businesses as currently owned and conducted. All of the
outstanding shares and other ownership interests of the Cedara Material
Subsidiaries which are held directly or indirectly by Cedara are validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable and all such shares and other ownership
interests are owned directly or indirectly by Cedara, free and clear of all
material liens, claims or encumbrances, except as set forth in Section 3.1(a)
of the Cedara Disclosure Letter or pursuant to restrictions on transfers
contained in constating documents, and except as aforesaid there are no
outstanding options, rights, entitlements, understandings or commitments
(contingent or otherwise) regarding the right to acquire any

  



  

17   

     
   

  



  

such shares or other ownership interests in any of the Cedara Material
Subsidiaries. Cedara has disclosed in Section 3.1(a) of the Cedara Disclosure
Letter the names and jurisdictions of incorporation of each of the Cedara
Material Subsidiaries.

  



  

(ii) Neither Cedara nor any Cedara Material Subsidiary has any minority
interest in any other corporation or entity, which minority interest is
material in relation to the consolidated financial position of Cedara.

  



  

(b) _Capitalization_. The authorized capital of Cedara consists of an
unlimited number of Common Shares. As of January 14, 2005 there were
31,842,973 Cedara Common Shares issued and outstanding, and 5,700,000 Cedara
Common Shares were reserved, in the aggregate, for issuance in respect of
Cedara Options. As of January 14, 2005, Cedara had outstanding options under
the Cedara Stock Option Plan permitting the holders thereof to purchase
3,451,517 Cedara Common Shares in the aggregate. Except as described in the
preceding sentences of this section 3.1(b) and in section 3.1(a)(i), there
are no options, warrants, conversion privileges or other rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments (pre-emptive, contingent or otherwise) obligating
Cedara or any Cedara Material Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of
Cedara or any of the Cedara Material Subsidiaries or securities
or obligations of any kind convertible into or exchangeable for any shares
of Cedara, any Cedara Material Subsidiary or any other Person, nor is
there outstanding any stock appreciation rights, phantom equity or similar
rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments based upon the book value,
income or any other attribute of Cedara or any Subsidiary. Except as set
forth in Section 3.1(b) of the Cedara Disclosure Letter, there have been no
Cedara Common Shares issued or purchased for cancellation since September 30,
2004. All outstanding Cedara Common Shares have been duly authorized and are
validly issued and outstanding as fully paid and non-assessable shares, free
of pre-emptive rights. There are no outstanding bonds, debentures or other
evidences of indebtedness of Cedara or any Subsidiary having the right to
vote (or that are convertible for or exercisable into securities having the
right to vote) with the holders of Cedara Common Shares on any matter. Except
as set forth in Section 3.1(b) of the Cedara Disclosure Letter, there are no
outstanding contractual obligations of Cedara or any of the Cedara Material
Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of its
outstanding securities or with respect to the voting or disposition of any
outstanding securities of any of the Cedara Material Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c) _Authority and No Violation_.

  



  

(i) Cedara has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Cedara and the consummation by Cedara of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been duly authorized by its
Board of Directors and no other corporate proceedings

  



  

18   

     
   

  



  

on its part are necessary to authorize this Agreement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby other than:

  



  

(A) with respect to the Circular and other matters relating solely thereto,
including the implementation of the Arrangement, the approval of the Board of
Directors of Cedara; and

  



  

(B) with respect to the completion of the Arrangement, the approval of the
holders of Cedara Common Shares and Cedara Options, voting as a single class.

  



  

(ii) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Cedara and
constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it
in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and other
applicable Laws affecting creditors rights generally, and to general
principles of equity and to the fact that the _Currency Act_  (Canada)
precludes a court in Canada from giving judgment in any currency other than
Canadian currency.

  



  

(iii) The Board of Directors of Cedara has (A) determined that the
Arrangement is fair to the holders of Cedara Common Shares and is in the best
interests of Cedara, (B) received an opinion from Genuity Capital Markets to
the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the Exchange Ratio is fair
from a financial point of view to the holders of Cedara Common Shares and (C)
determined to recommend that the holders of Cedara Common Shares vote in
favour of the Arrangement. Cedara is not subject to a shareholder rights
plan or "poison pill" or similar plan.

  



  

(iv) The approval of this Agreement, the execution and delivery by Cedara of
this Agreement and the performance by it of its obligations hereunder and
the completion of the Arrangement and the transactions contemplated thereby,
will not, except as disclosed in Section 3.1(c) of the Cedara
Disclosure Letter:

19   

     
   

  



  

(II) subject to obtaining the Appropriate Regulatory Approvals relating to
Cedara, any Laws, judgment or decree except to the extent that the violation
or breach of, or failure to obtain any consent under, any Laws, judgment or
decree would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on Cedara ; or

  



  

(III) subject to obtaining the Appropriate Regulatory Approvals relating to
Cedara and except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect on Cedara, any material contract, agreement, license,
franchise or permit to which Cedara or any Cedara Material Subsidiary is
party or by which it is bound or subject or is the beneficiary;

  



  

(B) give rise to any right of termination or acceleration of indebtedness of
Cedara or any Subsidiary, or cause any such indebtedness to come due before
its stated maturity or cause any available credit of Cedara or any Subsidiary
to cease to be available other than as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Cedara;

  



  

(C) except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Cedara, result in the imposition of any encumbrance, charge
or lien upon any of its assets or the assets of any Cedara Material
Subsidiary, or restrict, hinder, impair or limit the ability of Cedara or any
Cedara Material Subsidiary to carry on the business of Cedara or any Cedara
Material Subsidiary as and where it is now being carried on; or

  



  

(D) result in any payment (including severance, unemployment compensation,
golden parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any director or
employee of Cedara or any Subsidiary or increase any benefits otherwise
payable under any Cedara Plan or result in the acceleration of time of
payment or vesting of any such benefits, including the time of exercise of
stock options.

  



  

No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or declaration or filing
with, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained by Cedara and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or the consummation by Cedara of the transactions contemplated hereby other
than (A) any approvals required by the Interim Order, (B) the Final Order,
(C) filings with the Director under the OBCA, (D) the Appropriate Regulatory
Approvals relating to Cedara and (E) any other consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, declarations or filings of or with a Governmental Entity
which, if not obtained,

  



  

20   

     
   

  



  

would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
on Cedara.

  



  

(d) _No Defaults._ Subject to obtaining the Appropriate Regulatory Approvals
relating to Cedara and except as disclosed in Section 3.1(d) of the Cedara
Disclosure Letter, neither Cedara nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default
under, and there exists no event, condition or occurrence which, after notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default under,
any contract, agreement, license or franchise to which it is a party which
would, if terminated due to such default, cause a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(e) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events._ Except as disclosed in Section
3.1(e) of the Cedara Disclosure Letter or Publicly Disclosed by Cedara, from
September 30, 2004 through to the date hereof each of Cedara and the Cedara

(f) _Employment Matters_.

  



  

(i) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(f) of the Cedara Disclosure Letter,

(ii) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(f) of the Cedara Disclosure Letter,
neither Cedara nor any Cedara Material Subsidiary is a party to any

(iv) Cedara and all Cedara Material Subsidiaries have operated in accordance
with all applicable Laws with respect to employment and labour, including,

22   

     
   

  



  

(g) _Financial Statements. _The audited consolidated financial statements for
Cedara as at and for each **** of the 12-month periods ended June 30, 2004,
2003 and 2002, and the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the
three-month period ended September 30, 2004 have been prepared in accordance
with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles and, to the extent
required by applicable Laws, United States generally accepted accounting
principles (in each case subject, in the case of such unaudited financial
statements, to the absence of notes and to year-end adjustments), the
requirements of applicable Governmental Entities and applicable securities
Laws. The audited consolidated financial statements for eMed as at and for
each **** of the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, and
the unaudited consolidated financial statements of eMed for the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2004 have been prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles (subject, in the case
of such unaudited financial statements, to the absence of notes and to year-
end adjustments), the requirements of applicable Governmental Entities
and applicable securities Laws. All financial statements referenced in this
Section 3.1(g) present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position and results of operations of Cedara and its Subsidiaries
or of eMed, as the case may be, as of the respective dates thereof and for
the respective periods covered thereby, subject, in the case of such
unaudited financial statements, to year-end adjustments.

  



  

(h) _Books and Records._ The books, records and accounts of Cedara and its
Subsidiaries, in all material respects, (i) have been maintained
in accordance with good business practices on a basis consistent with prior
years, and in compliance with the requirements of SOX (as defined in Section
3.1(m)), (ii) are stated in reasonable detail and accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Cedara and its
Subsidiaries; and (iii) accurately and fairly reflect the basis for Cedara
consolidated financial statements. Cedara has devised and maintains a system
of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization; and (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (A)
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with Canadian
generally accepted accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to
such statements and (B) to maintain accountability for assets.  Cedara (i)
maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) with respect to the business of Cedara
and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) management of Cedara has assessed Cedaras
internal control over financial reporting in the manner and to the extent
required by applicable Law.  As of the end of the most recent fiscal year for
which Cedara is required by Item 308 of Regulation S-K to prepare a
managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting, if
any, there is no significant deficiency or material weaknesses in the design
or operation of Cedaras internal control over financial reporting and, to
the knowledge of Cedara, the attestation report of Cedaras auditors for such
fiscal year will not indicate a significant deficiency or material

  



  

23   

     
   

  



  

weakness in the design or operation of Cedaras internal control over
financial reporting.

  



  

(i) _Litigation, Etc. _Except as set forth in Section 3.1(i) of the Cedara
Disclosure Letter or Publicly Disclosed by Cedara, there is no claim, action,
proceeding or investigation (including any native land claims) pending or, to
the knowledge of Cedara, threatened against Cedara or any Cedara Material
Subsidiary before any court or Governmental Entity that would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Cedara, or prevent or
materially delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Arrangement. Neither Cedara nor any Cedara
Material Subsidiary, nor their respective assets and properties, is subject
to any outstanding judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree that has had
or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Cedara or that
would prevent or materially delay consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Arrangement.

aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Cedara, all operations
of Cedara and the Cedara Material Subsidiaries have been conducted, and are
now, in compliance with all Environmental Laws; and Cedara and the Cedara
Material Subsidiaries are in possession of, and in compliance with, all

necessary under Environmental Laws to own, lease and operate their properties
and conduct their respective businesses as they are now being conducted or as

all material Tax Returns required to be filed by them (all of which returns
were correct and complete in all material respects) and have paid, or caused
to be paid, all material amounts of Taxes shown to be due and payable
thereon, and Cedaras most recently published financial statements contain an
adequate provision in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles for all material amounts of Taxes payable in respect of each
period covered by such financial statements and all prior periods to the
extent such Taxes have not been paid, whether or not due and whether or not
shown as being due on any Tax Returns. Cedara and each of its Subsidiaries
have made adequate provision in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in their books and records for any material amounts of Taxes
accruing in respect of any accounting period which has ended subsequent to

that any issues involving a material amount of Taxes have been raised (and
are currently pending) by the Canada Revenue Agency, the United States
Internal Revenue Service, or any other taxing authority, including, without
limitation, any sales tax authority, in connection with any of the Tax
Returns referred to above and no waivers of statutes of limitations have been
given or requested with respect to Cedara or any Cedara Material Subsidiary.
All liability of Cedara and the Cedara Material Subsidiaries for income taxes
has been assessed (but may not have been audited) for all fiscal years up to
and including the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 (except that with respect
to eMed, such liability has been assessed for all fiscal years up to and
including the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003). To the best of the
knowledge of Cedara, there are no proposed in writing (but unassessed)
additional Taxes involving a material amount of Taxes and none has been
asserted in writing. No Tax liens with an aggregate amount of greater
than US$10,000 have been filed for material amounts of Taxes. Neither Cedara
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any Tax sharing or other similar
agreement or arrangement of any nature with any other person pursuant to
which Cedara or any of its Subsidiaries has or could have any material
liabilities in respect of Taxes. Cedara has not made an election under
Section 897(i) of the United States Internal Revenue Code (the " **Code** ")
to be treated as a domestic corporation for purposes of Sections 897, 1445
and 6039C of the Code.

  



  

(iii) Cedara and each of its Subsidiaries have properly withheld and remitted

and have paid such amounts to the appropriate authority on a timely basis and
in the form required by the appropriate legislation.

  



  

(iv) To the knowledge of Cedara, no assessment, reassessment, audit or

Taxes" shall mean US$500,000 or more.

  



  

25   



  

      
  

  



  

(l) _Pension and Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(i) Section 3.1(l) of the Cedara Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all

disability and similar plans or arrangements or practices, whether written or
oral, which are maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Cedara and/or a
Cedara Material Subsidiary or with respect to which Cedara and/or a Cedara
Material Subsidiary participates or has any liability or obligation
(collectively referred to as the **"Cedara Plans"** ). Section 3.1(l) of the
Cedara Disclosure Letter states:  (A) which of Cedara Plans constitute
"employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in section 3(2) of the United
States Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (
**"ERISA"** )) or "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in section
3(1) of ERISA); or (B) "registered pension plans" for purposes of the _Income
Tax Act_ (Canada).

  



  

(ii) No step has been taken, no event has occurred and no condition or
circumstance exists that has resulted in or could reasonably be expected to
result in any Cedara Plan being ordered or required to be terminated or wound
up in whole or in part or having its registration under applicable Laws
refused or revoked, or being placed under the administration of any trustee
or receiver or regulatory authority or being required to pay any material
Taxes, fees, penalties or levies under applicable Laws. There are no actions,
suits, claims (other than routine claims for payment of benefits in the
ordinary course), trials, demands, investigations, arbitrations or other
proceedings which are pending or threatened in respect of any of Cedara Plans
or their assets which individually or in the aggregate would have a Material
Adverse Effect on Cedara or a Cedara Material Subsidiary. Further,
there exists no state or facts which after notice or lapse of time or both
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such action, suit, claim,
trial, demand, investigation, arbitration or other proceeding.

  



  

(iii) Cedara has made available to Merge true, correct and complete copies of
all of Cedara Plans as amended (or, in the case of any unwritten Cedara Plan,
a description thereof) together with all related documentation including,
without limitation, funding agreements, actuarial reports, funding and
financial information returns and statements and material correspondence with
regulatory authorities with respect to each Cedara Plan, and current plan
summaries, booklets and personnel manuals. Cedara has made available to
Merge a true and complete copy of the most recent annual report on Form 5500
filed with the United States Internal Revenue Service with respect to each
Cedara Plan in respect of which such a report was required.

  



  

26   

     
   

  



  

(iv) Other than as disclosed in Section 3.1(l) of the Cedara Disclosure
Letter, all of the Cedara Plans are and have been established, registered,
qualified, invested and administered, in all material respects, in accordance
with all applicable Laws, and in accordance with their terms and the terms of
agreements between Cedara and/or a Cedara Material Subsidiary, as the case
may be, and their respective employees. To the knowledge of Cedara, no fact
or circumstance exists that could adversely affect the existing tax status of
a Cedara Plan.

  



  

(v) All obligations of Cedara or a Cedara Subsidiary regarding Cedara Plans
have been satisfied in all material respects. All contributions or premiums
required to be made by Cedara and/or a Cedara Material Subsidiary, as the
case may be, under the terms of each Cedara Plan or by applicable Laws have
been made in a timely fashion in accordance with applicable Laws and the
terms of the Cedara Plans. All liabilities of Cedara and the Cedara Material
Subsidiaries (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) related to
the Cedara Plans have been fully and accurately disclosed in accordance
with GAAP in Cedaras financial statements.

  



  

(vi) Other than as set forth in Section 3.1(l) of the Cedara Disclosure
Letter or Publicly Disclosed by Cedara, each Cedara Plan is fully insured or
fully funded and in good standing with such regulatory authorities as may be
applicable pursuant to the actuarial assumptions in and, as of the date
hereof, no notice of under-funding, non-compliance, failure to be in good
standing or otherwise has been received by Cedara or its Subsidiaries from
any such regulatory authority.

  



  

(vii) There have been no improper withdrawals, applications or transfers of
assets from any Cedara Plan or the trusts or other funding media relating
thereto that remain outstanding and unremedied, and neither Cedara, nor any
Cedara Subsidiary, nor any of their respective agents has been in breach of
any fiduciary obligation with respect to the administration of Cedara Plans
or the trusts or other funding media relating thereto.

  



  

(viii) No insurance policy or any other contract or agreement affecting any
Cedara Plan requires or permits a retroactive increase in premiums or
payments due thereunder.

  



  

(ix) All Cedara Plans intended to be tax-qualified in the United States have
been the subject of determination letters from the United States Internal
Revenue Service to the effect that such Cedara Plans are qualified and exempt
from United States Federal income taxes under sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such determination letter has been
revoked nor, to the knowledge of Cedara, has revocation been threatened, nor
has any such Cedara Plan been amended since the date of its most recent
determination letter or application therefor in any respect

  



  

27   

     
   

  



  

that would adversely affect its qualification or materially increase its
costs and, to the knowledge of Cedara, nothing has occurred since the date of
such letter that could reasonably be expected to affect the qualified status
of such plan.

  



  

(x) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(l) of the Cedara Disclosure Letter, no
amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property) as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Arrangement by any employee, officer or director of Cedara or any of
its affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined
in proposed United States Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under
any employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation
arrangement or Cedara Plan currently in effect will fail to be deductible for
United States federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the
Code.

  



  

(xi) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(l) of the Cedara Disclosure Letter,
none of Cedara Plans is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of section
4001(a)(3) of ERISA or any other applicable Laws, nor has Cedara or any
Cedara Subsidiary been obligated to contribute to any such multiemployer plan
at any time within the past five years.

  



  

(xii) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(l) of the Cedara Disclosure Letter,
none of the Cedara Plans provides for payment of a benefit, the increase of a
benefit amount, the payment of a contingent benefit or the acceleration of
the payment or vesting of a benefit by reason of the execution of or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Arrangement.

and each Cedara Subsidiary has and is in compliance with all
necessary licenses and permits, including without limitation from Health
Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration necessary under Health Laws

3.1(p) of the Cedara Disclosure Letter or Publicly Disclosed by Cedara, there
is no agreement, judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon Cedara or
any Cedara Subsidiary that has or could reasonably be expected to have the

practice of Cedara or any Cedara Material Subsidiary, any acquisition of
property by Cedara or any Cedara Material Subsidiary or the conduct of
business by Cedara or any Cedara Material Subsidiary as currently conducted
other than such agreements, judgments, injunctions, orders or decrees which

(r) _Intellectual Property_.

  



  

(i) Cedara or a Cedara Subsidiary owns or has the right to use pursuant to
valid license, sublicense, contract or permission all Intellectual
Property necessary or desirable for its operations as presently conducted.
Each item of Intellectual Property owned or used by Cedara or a Cedara
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing will continue to be owned or
available for use by Cedara on identical terms and conditions immediately
subsequent to the Closing. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, will not (A) constitute a breach of any instrument or contract
governing any Intellectual Property, (B) cause the forfeiture or termination
or give rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of any Intellectual
Property or (C) impair the right of Cedara or Merge or their

  



  

30   

     
   

  



  

respective Subsidiaries to use, sell or license any Intellectual Property or
portion thereof.

Property rights of any third party. Neither the provision of any service nor
the manufacture, marketing, license, sale or intended use of any product or
technology currently licensed or sold by Cedara or any Cedara
Subsidiary violates any license or contract between Cedara or such Cedara
Subsidiary and any third party or infringes any third party intellectual
property rights. Neither Cedara nor any Cedara Subsidiary has received any
charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice alleging any such interference,
infringement, misappropriation or violation (including any claim that Cedara
or a Cedara Subsidiary must license or refrain from using any Intellectual
Property rights of any third party). No third party has interfered with,
infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise come into conflict with any
Intellectual Property rights of Cedara or any Cedara Subsidiary. Except as

nor any Cedara Subsidiary has licensed or permitted any third party to
exploit any of the Intellectual Property (other than contracts entered into
in the ordinary course of business).

  



  

(iii) Section 3.1(r) of the Cedara Disclosure Letter identifies each patent
or registration of Intellectual Property owned by Cedara or any
Cedara Subsidiary or for which an application filed by Cedara or any Cedara
Subsidiary is pending, and identifies each license, sublicense, contract or
permission pursuant to which Cedara or any Cedara Subsidiary uses any item of
Intellectual Property (other than contracts entered into in the ordinary
course of business).

  



  

(s) _Insurance_. Cedara has policies of insurance in force as of the date
hereof naming Cedara as an insured which, having regard to the nature of such
risk and the relative cost of obtaining insurance, Cedara believes are

or licences from land owners or authorities permitting the use of land by

of its businesses as presently owned and conducted except for such failure of
title that would individually or in the aggregate not have a Material Adverse
Effect on Cedara.

  



  

(u) _ Licences, Etc_. Except as disclosed in Section 3.1(u) of the Cedara
Disclosure Letter, Cedara and each Cedara Subsidiary owns, possesses, or has
obtained and is in compliance with, all licences, permits, certificates,

failure that would individually or in the aggregate not have a Material
Adverse Effect on Cedara.

right to compel Cedara to register or otherwise qualify such securities for
public sale in Canada or the United States.

and (y) did not at the time they were filed with the SEC, contain any untrue

respects with all applicable securities Laws and all securities to be issued
upon exercise of any such options, rights and other convertible

returns were correct and complete in all material respects) and have paid, or
caused to be paid, all material amounts of Taxes shown to be due and payable
thereon, and Merges most recently published financial statements contain an
adequate provision in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles for all material amounts of Taxes payable in respect of each

with respect to a material amount of Taxes for which Merge or any of its
Subsidiaries could be liable, in whole or in part.

  



  

(v) For purposes of this section 3.2(m), the term "material amount of Taxes"
shall mean US$500,000 or more.

permits, authorizations, certificates, registrations, approvals and consents

Merge Disclosure Letter:

  



  

(i) Merge or a Merge Subsidiary owns or has the right to use pursuant
to valid license, sublicense, contract or permission all Intellectual
Property necessary or desirable for their operations as presently conducted.
Each item of Intellectual Property owned or used by Merge or a Merge
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing will continue to be owned or
available for use on identical terms and conditions immediately subsequent to
the Closing. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, will
not (A) constitute a breach of any instrument or Contract governing any
Intellectual Property, (B) cause the forfeiture or termination or give rise
to a right of forfeiture or termination of any Intellectual Property or (C)
impair the right to use, sell or license any Intellectual Property or portion
thereof.

  



  

(ii) Neither Merge nor any Merge Subsidiary has interfered with, infringed
upon, misappropriated or otherwise come into conflict with any Intellectual
Property rights of any third party. Neither the provision of any

  



  

41   

     
   

  



  

service nor the manufacture, marketing, license, sale or intended use of any
product or technology currently licensed or sold by Merge or any
Merge Subsidiary violates any license or Contract between Merge or a Merge
Subsidiary and any third party or infringes any third party intellectual
property rights. Neither Merge nor any Merge Subsidiary has received any
charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice alleging any such interference,
infringement, misappropriation or violation (including any claim that Merge
or a Merge Subsidiary must license or refrain from using any Intellectual
Property rights of any third party). No third party has interfered with,
infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise come into conflict with any
Intellectual Property rights of Merge or any Merge Subsidiary. Except as
set forth at Section 3.2(o) of the Merge Disclosure Letter, neither Merge
nor any Merge Subsidiary has licensed or permitted any third party to exploit
any of the Intellectual Property (other than contracts entered into in the
ordinary course of business).

  



  

(iii) Section 3.2(o) of the Merge Disclosure Letter identifies each patent or
registration of Intellectual Property owned by Merge or any Merge Subsidiary
or for which an application filed by Merge or any Merge Subsidiary is
pending, and identifies each license, sublicense, contract or permission
pursuant to which Merge or any Merge Subsidiary uses any item of Intellectual
Property (other than contracts entered into in the ordinary course of
business).

  



  

(p) _Books and Records._ The books, records and accounts of Merge and its
Subsidiaries, in all material respects, (i) have been maintained
in accordance with good business practices on a basis consistent with prior
years, and in compliance with the requirements of SOX, (ii) are stated in
reasonable detail and accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of Merge and its Subsidiaries; and (iii)
accurately and fairly reflect the basis for Merge consolidated financial
statements. Merge has devised and maintains a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions
are executed in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization; and (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (A) to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements and
(B) to maintain accountability for assets. Merge (i) maintains a system
of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) with respect to the business of Merge and its Subsidiaries,
and (ii) management of Merge has assessed Merges internal control over
financial reporting in the manner and to the extent required by applicable
Law. As of December 31, 2004, there is no significant deficiency or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of Merges internal control over
financial reporting and, to the knowledge of Merge, the attestation report of
Merges auditors for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004 will not
indicate a significant deficiency or

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

material weakness in the design or operation of Merges internal control over
financial reporting.

disability and similar plans or arrangements or practices, whether written or
oral, which are maintained, sponsored or contributed to by Merge and/or a
Merge Material Subsidiary or with respect to which Merge and/or a Merge
Material Subsidiary participates or has any liability or obligation
(collectively referred to as the **"Merge Plans"** ). Section 3.2(q) of the
Merge Disclosure Letter states:  (A) which of Merge Plans constitute
"employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in section 3(2) of ERISA or

(B) "registered pension plans" for purposes of the _Income Tax Act_
 (Canada).

  



  

(ii) No step has been taken, no event has occurred and no condition or
circumstance exists that has resulted in or could reasonably be expected to
result in any Merge Plan being ordered or required to be terminated or wound
up in whole or in part or having its registration under applicable Laws
refused or revoked, or being placed under the administration of any trustee
or receiver or regulatory authority or being required to pay any material
Taxes, fees, penalties or levies under applicable Laws. There are no actions,
suits, claims (other than routine claims for payment of benefits in the
ordinary course), trials, demands, investigations, arbitrations or other
proceedings which are pending or threatened in respect of any of the Merge
Plans or their assets which individually or in the aggregate would have a
Material Adverse Effect on Merge or a Merge Material Subsidiary.
Further, there exists no state or facts which after notice or lapse of time
or both could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such action, suit,
claim, trial, demand, investigation, arbitration or other proceeding.

all of the Merge Plans as amended (or, in the case of any unwritten Merge

with regulatory authorities with respect to each Merge Plan, and current plan
summaries, booklets and personnel manuals. Merge has made available to
Cedara a true and complete copy of the most recent annual report on Form 5500

Revenue Service with respect to each Merge Plan in respect of which such a
report was required.

  



  

(iv) Other than as disclosed in Section 3.2(q) of the Merge Disclosure
Letter, all of the Merge Plans are and have been established, registered,
qualified, invested and administered, in all material respects, in accordance
with all applicable Laws, and in accordance with their terms and the terms of
agreements between Merge and/or a Merge Material Subsidiary, as the case may
be, and their respective employees. To the knowledge of Merge, no fact or
circumstance exists that could adversely affect the existing tax status of a
Merge Plan.

  



  

(v) All obligations of Merge or a Merge Subsidiary regarding Merge Plans have
been satisfied in all material respects. All contributions or premiums
required to be made by Merge and/or a Merge Material Subsidiary, as the case
may be, under the terms of each Merge Plan or by applicable Laws have been
made in a timely fashion in accordance with applicable Laws and the terms of
the Merge Plans.

  



  

(vi) Other than as set forth in Section 3.2(q) of the Merge Disclosure Letter
or Publicly Disclosed by Merge, each Merge Plan is fully insured or fully
funded and in good standing with such regulatory authorities as may be
applicable pursuant to the actuarial assumptions in and, as of the date
hereof, no notice of under-funding, non-compliance, failure to be in good
standing or otherwise has been received by Merge or its Subsidiaries from any
such regulatory authority. All liabilities of Merge and the Merge Material
Subsidiaries (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) related to
the Merge Plans have been fully and accurately disclosed in accordance with
GAAP in Merges financial statements.

  



  

(vii) There have been no improper withdrawals, applications or transfers of
assets from any Merge Plan or the trusts or other funding media relating
thereto that remain outstanding and unremedied, and neither Merge, nor any
Merge Subsidiary, nor any of their respective agents has been in breach of
any fiduciary obligation with respect to the administration of Merge Plans or
the trusts or other funding media relating thereto.

  



  

(viii) No insurance policy or any other contract or agreement affecting any
Merge Plan requires or permits a retroactive increase in premiums or payments
due thereunder.

  



  

(ix) All Merge Plans intended to be tax-qualified in the United States have
been the subject of determination letters from the United States Internal
Revenue Service to the effect that such Merge Plans are qualified and exempt
from United States Federal income taxes under sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, of the Code, and no such determination letter has

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

been revoked nor, to the knowledge of Merge, has revocation been threatened,
nor has any such Merge Plan been amended since the date of its most recent
determination letter or application therefor in any respect that would
adversely affect its qualification or materially increase its costs and, to
the knowledge of Merge, nothing has occurred since the date of such letter
that could reasonably be expected to affect the qualified status of such
plan.

  



  

(x) Except as set forth in Section 3.2(q) of the Merge Disclosure Letter, no
amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property) as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Arrangement by any employee, officer or director of Merge or any of
its affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined
in proposed United States Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under
any employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation
arrangement or Merge Plan currently in effect will fail to be deductible for
United States federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the
Code.

  



  

(xi) Except as set forth in Section 3.2(q) of the Merge Disclosure Letter,
none of Merge Plans is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of section

time within the past five years.

practice of Merge or any Merge Material Subsidiary, any acquisition of
property by Merge or any Merge Material Subsidiary or the conduct of business

 **4.5** Covenants Regarding Non-Solicitation

  

 ** **

  

(a) _Cedara Covenants_.

  



  

(i) Subject to section 4.6(a), Cedara shall not, directly or indirectly,
through any officer, director, employee, representative or agent of Cedara or
any of its Subsidiaries, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way
of furnishing information or entering into any form of agreement, arrangement
or understanding) the initiation of any inquiries or proposals regarding a
Cedara Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Cedara Acquisition Proposal, (iii) withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Merge the approval of the Board of Directors of
Cedara of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) approve or recommend any
Cedara Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any agreement, arrangement
or understanding related to any Cedara Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding
the preceding part of this section 4.5(a)(i) and any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing shall prevent the Board of Directors of Cedara prior to
the issuance of the Final Order from considering, participating in any
discussions or negotiations, or entering into a confidentiality agreement and
providing information pursuant to section 4.5(a)(iii), regarding an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Cedara Acquisition Proposal that did not
otherwise result from a breach of this section 4.5(a) and that the Board of
Directors of Cedara determines in good faith, after consultation with
financial advisors and outside counsel, is reasonably likely to result in a
Cedara Superior Proposal; provided, however, that prior to taking such
action, the Board of Directors of Cedara must receive advice of outside
counsel that the taking of such action by the Board of Directors is
consistent with the proper discharge of its fiduciary duties. Cedara shall not
consider, negotiate, accept, approve or

  



  

57   

     
   

  



  

recommend a Cedara Acquisition Proposal after the date of the issuance of the
Final Order. Cedara shall, and shall cause the officers, directors,
employees, representatives and agents of Cedara and its Subsidiaries to,
cease immediately all discussions and negotiations regarding any
proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Cedara Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(ii) Cedara shall promptly notify Merge, at first orally and then in writing,
of any Cedara Acquisition Proposal and any inquiry that could lead to a
Cedara Acquisition Proposal, or any amendments to the foregoing, or any
request for non-public information relating to Cedara or any Cedara Material
Subsidiary in connection with a Cedara Acquisition Proposal or for access to
the properties, books or records of Cedara or any Cedara Material Subsidiary
by any Person that informs Cedara or such Cedara Material Subsidiary that it
is considering making, or has made, a Cedara Acquisition Proposal. Such
notice shall include a description of the material terms and conditions of
any proposal, the identity of the Person making such proposal, inquiry or
contact and provide such other details of the proposal, inquiry or contact as
Merge may reasonably request. Cedara shall (i) keep Merge fully informed
of the status including any change to the material terms of any such
Cedara Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to Merge as soon
as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent or provided to Cedara or any
Cedara Material Subsidiary from any Person in connection with any Cedara
Acquisition Proposal or sent or provided by Cedara to any Person in
connection with any Cedara Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(iii) If Cedara receives a request for material non-public information from a
Person who has made an unsolicited _bona fide_  written Cedara Acquisition
Proposal and Cedara is permitted, as contemplated under the second sentence
of Section 4.5(a)(i), to negotiate the terms of such Cedara Acquisition
Proposal, then, and only in such case, the Board of Directors of Cedara may,
subject to the execution by such Person of a confidentiality agreement
containing confidentiality and standstill provisions substantially similar to
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, provide such Person with
access to information regarding Cedara; provided, however, that the Person
making the Cedara Acquisition Proposal shall not be precluded under such
confidentiality agreement from making the Cedara Acquisition Proposal (but
not any material amendment thereto) and provided further that Cedara sends a
copy of any such confidentiality agreement to Merge promptly upon its
execution and Merge is provided with a list of or copies of the information
provided to such Person and immediately provided with access to similar
information to which such person was provided.

  



  

58   

     
   

  



  

(iv) Cedara shall ensure that its officers, directors and employees and its
Subsidiaries and their officers, directors and employees and any financial
advisors or other advisors or representatives retained by it are aware of the
provisions of this section 4.5(a), and it shall be responsible for any breach
of this section 4.5(a) by its officers, directors, employees, financial
advisors or other advisors or representatives.

  



  

(b) _Merge Covenants_.

  



  

(i) Subject to section 4.6(b), Merge shall not, directly or indirectly,
through any officer, director, employee, representative or agent of Merge or
any of its Subsidiaries, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way
of furnishing information or entering into any form of agreement, arrangement
or understanding) the initiation of any inquiries or proposals regarding a
Merge Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Merge Acquisition Proposal, (iii) withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Cedara the approval of the Board of Directors
of Merge of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) approve or recommend
any Merge Acquisition Proposal or (v) enter into any agreement, arrangement
or understanding related to any Merge Acquisition Proposal.  Notwithstanding
the preceding part of this section 4.5(b)(i) and any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing shall prevent the Board of Directors of Merge prior to the
issuance of the Final Order from considering, participating in any
discussions or negotiations, or entering into a confidentiality agreement and
providing information pursuant to section 4.5(b)(iii), regarding an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Merge Acquisition Proposal that did not
otherwise result from a breach of this section 4.5(b) and that the Board of
Directors of Merge determines in good faith, after consultation with
financial advisors and outside counsel, is reasonably likely to result in a
Merge Superior Proposal; provided, however, that prior to taking such action,
the Board of Directors of Merge must receive advice of outside counsel that
the taking of such action by the Board of Directors is consistent with the
proper discharge of its fiduciary duties. Merge shall not consider, negotiate,
accept, approve or recommend a Merge Acquisition Proposal after the date of
the issuance of the Final Order. Merge shall, and shall cause the officers,
directors, employees, representatives and agents of Merge and its
Subsidiaries to, cease immediately all discussions and negotiations regarding
any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Merge Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(ii) Merge shall promptly notify Cedara, at first orally and then in writing,
of any Merge Acquisition Proposal and any inquiry that could lead to a Merge
Acquisition Proposal, or any amendments to the foregoing, or any request for
non-public information relating to Merge or any Merge Material Subsidiary in
connection with a Merge Acquisition Proposal or

  



  

59   

     
   

  



  

for access to the properties, books or records of Merge or any Merge Material
Subsidiary by any Person that informs Merge or such Merge Material Subsidiary
that it is considering making, or has made, a Merge Acquisition Proposal.
Such notice shall include a description of the material terms and conditions
of any proposal, the identity of the Person making such proposal, inquiry or
contact and provide such other details of the proposal, inquiry or contact as
Cedara may reasonably request. Merge shall (i) keep Cedara fully informed of
the status including any change to the material terms of any such Merge
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to Cedara as soon as
practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent or provided to Merge or
any Merge Material Subsidiary from any Person in connection with any
Merge Acquisition Proposal or sent or provided by Merge to any Person in
connection with any Merge Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(iii) If Merge receives a request for material non-public information from a
Person who has made an unsolicited _bona fide_  written Merge Acquisition
Proposal and Merge is permitted, as contemplated under the second sentence of
Section 4.5(b)(i), to negotiate the terms of such Merge Acquisition Proposal,
then, and only in such case, the Board of Directors of Merge may, subject to
the execution by such Person of a confidentiality agreement containing
confidentiality and standstill provisions substantially similar to those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, provide such Person with access
to information regarding Merge; provided, however, that the Person making the
Merge Acquisition Proposal shall not be precluded under such confidentiality
agreement from making the Merge Acquisition Proposal (but not any material
amendment thereto) and provided further that Merge sends a copy of any such
confidentiality agreement to Cedara promptly upon its execution and Cedara is
provided with a list of or copies of the information provided to such Person
and immediately provided with access to similar information to which such
person was provided.

  



  

(iv) Merge shall ensure that its officers and directors and its Subsidiaries
and their officers and directors and any financial advisors or other advisors
or representatives retained by it are aware of the provisions of this section
4.5(b), and it shall be responsible for any breach of this section 4.5(b) by
its officers, directors, employees, financial advisors or other advisors
or representatives.

  



  

 **4.6** Notice of Superior Proposal Determination

  



  

(a) _Cedara Covenants_.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding section 4.5(a), Cedara may accept, approve, recommend or
enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement in respect of a

  



  

60   

     
   

  



  

Cedara Superior Proposal if, and only if, (i) it has provided Merge with a
copy of the Cedara Superior Proposal document, (ii) five Business Days shall
have elapsed from the later of the date Merge received written notice
advising Merge that Cedaras Board of Directors has resolved, subject only to
compliance with this section 4.6(a) and termination of this Agreement, to
accept, approve, recommend or enter into an agreement in respect of such
Cedara Superior Proposal, specifying the terms and conditions of such Cedara
Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making such Cedara Superior
Proposal, and the date Merge received a copy of such Cedara Superior Proposal
and (iii) it has previously or concurrently will have (A) paid to Merge the
break fee, if any, payable under section 6.4 and (B) terminated this
Agreement pursuant to section 6.3. Any information provided by Cedara to
Merge pursuant to this section 4.6(a) or pursuant to section 4.5(a)
shall constitute "Information" under section 4.7(b).

  



  

(ii) During such five Business Day period, Cedara agrees that Merge shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of this
Agreement. The Board of Directors of Cedara will review any offer by Merge to
amend the terms of this Agreement in good faith in order to determine, in its
discretion in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, whether Merges offer
upon acceptance by Cedara would result in such Cedara Superior Proposal
ceasing to be a Cedara Superior Proposal. If the Board of Directors of Cedara
so determines, it will enter into an amended agreement with Merge reflecting
Merges amended proposal. If the Board of Directors of Cedara continues to
believe, in good faith and after consultation with financial advisors and
outside counsel, that such Cedara Superior Proposal remains a Cedara Superior
Proposal and therefore rejects Merges amended proposal, Cedara may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to section 6.3(c)(iv); provided, however, that Cedara
must concurrently pay to Merge the break fee payable, if any, to Merge under
section 6.4 **** and must concurrently with termination enter into
a definitive agreement with respect to such Cedara Acquisition Proposal.
Cedara acknowledges and agrees that payment of the break fee, if any, payable
under section 6.4 is a condition to valid termination of this Agreement under
section 6.3(c)(iv) and this section 4.6(a). Cedara also acknowledges and
agrees that each successive modification of any Cedara Acquisition Proposal
shall constitute a new Cedara Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this
section 4.6(a) to initiate an additional five Business Day notice period.

  



  

(b) _Merge Covenants_.

  



  

(i) Notwithstanding section 4.5(b), Merge may accept, approve, recommend or
enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement in respect of a Merge
Superior Proposal if, and only if, (i) it has provided Cedara with a

  



  

61   

     
   

  



  

copy of the Merge Superior Proposal document, (ii) five Business Days shall
have elapsed from the later of the date Cedara received written notice
advising Cedara that Merges Board of Directors has resolved, subject only to
compliance with this section 4.6(b) and termination of this Agreement, to
accept, approve, recommend or enter into an agreement in respect of such
Merge Superior Proposal, specifying the terms and conditions of such Merge
Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making such Merge Superior
Proposal, and the date Cedara received a copy of such Merge Superior Proposal
and (iii) it has previously or concurrently will have (A) paid to Cedara the
break fee, if any, payable under section 6.4 and (B) terminated this
Agreement pursuant to section 6.3. Any information provided by Merge to
Cedara pursuant to this section 4.6(b) or pursuant to section 4.5(b)
shall constitute "Information" under section 4.7(b).

  



  

(ii) During such five Business Day period, Merge agrees that Cedara shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to offer to amend the terms of this
Agreement. The Board of Directors of Merge will review any offer by Cedara to
amend the terms of this Agreement in good faith in order to determine, in its
discretion in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, whether Cedaras offer
upon acceptance by Merge would result in such Merge Superior Proposal ceasing
to be a Merge Superior Proposal. If the Board of Directors of Merge so
determines, it will enter into an amended agreement with Cedara reflecting
Cedaras amended proposal. If the Board of Directors of Merge continues to
believe, in good faith and after consultation with financial advisors and
outside counsel, that such Merge Superior Proposal remains a Merge Superior
Proposal and therefore rejects Cedaras amended proposal, Merge may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to section 6.3(c)(vi); provided, however, that Merge
must concurrently pay to Cedara the break fee payable, if any, to Cedara
under section 6.4 **** and must concurrently with termination enter into
a definitive agreement with respect to such Merge Acquisition Proposal. Merge
acknowledges and agrees that payment of the break fee, if any, payable under
section 6.4 is a condition to valid termination of this Agreement under
section 6.3(c)(vi) and this section 4.6(b). Merge also acknowledges and agrees
that each successive modification of any Merge Acquisition Proposal shall
constitute a new Merge Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this section
4.6(b) to initiate an additional five Business Day notice period.

  



  

 **4.7** Access to Information

  



  

(a) Subject to sections 4.7(b) and (c) and applicable Laws, upon reasonable
notice, Cedara shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford
Merges officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives and advisors ( **"Representatives"** ) access, during normal
business hours from the date

  



  

62   

     
   

  



  

hereof and until the earlier of the Effective Date or the termination of this
Agreement, to its properties, books, contracts and records as well as to its
management personnel, and, during such period, Cedara shall (and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Merge all information
concerning Cedaras business, properties and personnel as Merge may
reasonably request. Subject to sections 4.7(b) and (c) and applicable laws,
upon reasonable notice, Merge shall afford Cedaras Representatives access,
during normal business hours from the date hereof and until the earlier of
the Effective Date or the termination of this Agreement, to its
properties, books, contracts and records as well as to its management
personnel, and, during such period, Merge shall (and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Cedara all information concerning
Merges business, properties and personnel as Cedara may reasonably request.
Nothing in the foregoing shall require Merge or Cedara to disclose to the
other information subject to a written confidentiality agreement with third
parties or customer-specific or competitively sensitive information relating
to areas or projects where Merge and Cedara are in direct competition.

  



  

(b) In accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, each of Merge and
Cedara acknowledges that certain information provided to it under section
4.7(a) above will be non-public and/or proprietary in nature (the
**"Information"** ). Except as permitted below, each of Merge and Cedara will
keep Information confidential and will not, without the prior written consent
of the other, disclose it, in any manner whatsoever, in whole or in part, to
any other Person, and will not use it for any purpose other than to evaluate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Merge and Cedara
will make all reasonable, necessary and appropriate efforts to safeguard the
Information from disclosure to anyone other than as permitted hereby and to
control the copies, extracts or reproductions made of the Information. The
Information may be provided to the Representatives of each of Merge and
Cedara who require access to the same to assist it in proceeding in good
faith with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and whose
assistance is required for such purposes, provided that it has first informed
such Representatives to whom Information is provided that the Representative
has the same obligations, including as to confidentiality, restricted use and
otherwise, that it has with respect to such Information. This provision shall
not apply to such portions of the Information that: (i) are or become
generally available to the public otherwise than as a result of disclosure by
a party or its Representatives; or (ii) become available to a party on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than, directly or indirectly, the
other party or its Representatives, provided that such source is not to the
knowledge of the first party, upon reasonable inquiry, prohibited from
transmitting the Information by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation;
(iii) were known to a party or were in its possession on a non-confidential
basis prior to being disclosed to it by the other party or by someone on its
behalf; or (iv) are required by applicable Laws or court order to be
disclosed. The provisions of this section 4.7(b) shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

  



  

63   

     
   

  



  

(c) The parties acknowledge that certain Information may be competitively
sensitive and that disclosure thereof shall be limited to that which is
reasonably necessary for the purpose of (i) preparing submissions or
applications in order to obtain the Appropriate Regulatory Approvals, (ii)
preparing the Circular, (iii) avoiding conflicts and (iv) integrating the
operations of Merge and Cedara.

  



  

 **4.8** Closing Matters

  



  

Each of the Merge Parties and Cedara shall deliver, at the closing of the
transactions contemplated hereby, such customary certificates,
resolutions and other closing documents as may be required by the other
parties hereto, acting reasonably.

  



  

 **4.9** Indemnification

  



  

(a) Merge agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation now
existing in favour of the directors or officers of Cedara or any Subsidiary
as provided in its articles of incorporation or by-laws in effect on the date
hereof shall survive the Arrangement and shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time and
Merge hereby assumes, effective upon consummation of the Arrangement, all
such liability with respect to any matters arising prior to the Effective
Time.

  



  

(b) There shall be maintained in effect, for not less than six years from the
Effective Time, coverage equivalent to that in effect under the current
policies of the directors and officers liability insurance maintained by
Cedara, which is no less advantageous, and with no gaps or lapses in
coverages with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

 **4.10** Section 3(a)(10) Exemption.

  



  

In the event that, due to an amendment to the 1933 Act, a change in the SECs
interpretation of the 1933 Act or a decision of a court which provides that
orders of Canadian courts such as the Final Order do not qualify under Section
3(a)(10) of the 1933 Act, the exemption from registration under Section
3(a)(10) of the 1933 Act is not available for any reason to exempt the
issuance of the Merge Common Shares and Exchangeable Shares in accordance
with the Arrangement from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act, then
Merge shall take all necessary action to file a registration statement on
Form S-4 (or on such other form that may be available to Merge) in order to
register the Merge Common Shares and Exchangeable Shares, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become
effective at or prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

 **4.11** Board of Directors.

  

 ** **

  

Merge agrees that, in connection with the annual meeting of the holders of
Merge Common Shares to be held in 2005, the Board of Directors of Merge shall
nominate for election at such meeting each of the Cedara Designees, and shall
recommend in the proxy materials distributed to the holders of Merge Common
Shares in connection with such meeting that such

  



  

64   

     
   

  



  

holders vote in favor of each of the Cedara Designees. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if at any time, Merges Board of Directors receives advice
of outside counsel that the taking of any action pursuant to this Section
4.11 would be inconsistent with the proper discharge of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, Merges Board of Directors need not take such action.

  



  

 **4.12** Certain Employment Matters.

  

 ** **

  

On the Effective Time and for a period not less than one year after
the Effective Time, employees of Cedara and its Subsidiaries shall be
provided employee benefits, plans and programs which are no less favorable in
the aggregate than those available to such employees under the Cedara Plans
on the date hereof. For purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting,
waiting periods, pre-existing conditions and similar purposes (but not
benefit accrual attributable to the period before the Effective Time) in all
benefits provided to employees, the employees of Cedara and its Subsidiaries
will be credited with their years of service with Cedara and its Subsidiaries
and prior employers, to the extent such service is taken into account under
current plans of Cedara and its Subsidiaries. In addition, the parties shall
effect the matters with respect to Cedara employees and directors which are
set forth in Schedule G attached hereto. Nothing in this Section 4.12 shall
be construed as restricting the ability of Merge or its Subsidiaries
to establish such types and levels of compensation and benefits or to modify
or terminate such compensation or benefits as they determine to be
appropriate from time to time.

Arrangement.

  



  

The Merge Parties may not rely on the failure to satisfy any of the above

been satisfied but for a material default by the Merge Parties in complying
with their obligations hereunder.

  



  

 **5.3** Additional Conditions Precedent to the Obligations of Cedara

  

 ** **

  

The obligations of Cedara to complete the transactions contemplated by this

material default by Cedara in complying with its obligations hereunder.

  



  

 **5.4** Notice and Cure Provisions

  



  

The Merge Parties and Cedara will give prompt notice to the other of
the occurrence, or failure to occur, at any time from the date hereof until
the Effective Date, of any event or state of facts which occurrence or
failure would, or would be likely to:

  



  

(a) cause any of the representations or warranties of the other party
contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect on the
date hereof or on the Effective Date; or

  



  

68

any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by the
other hereunder prior to the Effective Date.

  



  

Neither the Merge Parties nor Cedara may elect not to complete
the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the conditions precedent
contained in sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, or exercise any termination right
arising therefrom, unless forthwith and in any event prior to the filing of
the Final Order for acceptance by the Director, the Merge Parties or Cedara,
as the case may be, have delivered a written notice to the other specifying
in reasonable detail all breaches of covenants, representations and
warranties or other matters which the Merge Parties or Cedara, as the case
may be, are asserting as the basis for the non-fulfillment of the applicable
condition precedent or the exercise of the termination right, as the case may
be. If any such notice is delivered, provided that the Merge Parties or
Cedara, as the case may be, are proceeding diligently to cure such matter, if
such matter is susceptible to being cured, the other may not terminate this
Agreement as a result thereof until the later of June 30, 2005 and the
expiration of a period of 30 days from such notice. If such notice has been
delivered prior to the date of Cedara Meeting, such meeting shall be
postponed until the expiry of such period. If such notice has been delivered
prior to the making of the application for the Final Order or the filing of
the Articles of Arrangement with the Director, such application and such
filing shall be postponed until the expiry of such period.  For greater
certainty, in the event that such matter is cured within the time period
referred to herein, this Agreement may not be terminated.

  



  

 **5.5** Satisfaction of Conditions

  

 ** **

  

The conditions precedent set out in sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 shall
be conclusively deemed to have been satisfied, waived or released when, with

after the date hereof and prior to the expiration of twelve months following
termination of this Agreement;

  



  

then in any such case Merge shall pay to Cedara US$7,000,000 in immediately
available funds to an account designated by Cedara. Such payment shall be due
(A) in the case of a termination specified in clause (i), prior to the
termination of

  



  

72   

     
   

  



  

this Agreement, (B) in the case of a termination specified in clause (ii),
within five Business Days after written notice of termination by Cedara or
(C) in the case of a termination specified in clause (iii), at or prior

 **6.5** Effect of Break Fee Payment

  

 ** **

  

For greater certainty, the parties hereto agree that if a party pays
to another party amounts required by section 6.4 as a result of
the occurrence of any of the events referenced in section 6.4, the parties
to this Agreement shall have no other remedy for any breach of this Agreement
by the party making such payment.

  



  

 **6.6** Remedies

  

 ** **

  

Subject to section 6.5, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that an
award of money damages would be inadequate for any breach of this Agreement
by any party or its representatives and any such breach would cause the non-
breaching party irreparable harm.  Accordingly, the parties hereto agree
that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by
one of the parties, the non-breaching party will also be entitled, without
the requirement of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief,
including injunctive relief and specific performance. Such remedies will not
be the exclusive remedies for any breach of this Agreement but will be in
addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to each of the
parties.
