-iv- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 21, 2007 (the " _Agreement_
"), by and among Chill Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "),
Chill Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Goodman Global, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Company_ ").

_WITNESSETH_ :

WHEREAS, the parties intend to effect an acquisition of the Company by Parent
through the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the " _Merger_ "),
with the Company as the surviving corporation;

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Merger Sub and the Company
have each determined and declared that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of
their respective stockholders and, therefore, have approved, and the Board
of Directors of the Parent has approved, this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent and certain stockholders of the Company (the " _Principal Company
Stockholders_ ") are entering into an agreement pursuant to which the
Principal Company Stockholders will agree to take specified actions in
furtherance of the Merger; and

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in
connection with this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and
intending to be legally bound by this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company,
whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ ") under the laws of Delaware as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent.

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of OMelveny and Myers LLP, Times Square Tower, 7
Times Square, New York, New York 10036 at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to
be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ ") which shall be no later
than the later of (a) the second business day after the satisfaction or
waiver, to the extent permitted by applicable Law (as hereinafter defined), of
the conditions    set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of such conditions) and (b) the earlier of (x) a date during the Marketing
Period to be specified by Parent on no less than three (3) Business Days
notice to the Company (it being understood that such date may be conditioned
upon the simultaneous completion of a high yield debt financing) and (y) the
final day of the Marketing Period, or at such other place, date and time as
the Company and Parent may agree in writing.

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Prior to the Closing, Parent and the Company
shall prepare, and on the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter
the Company shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a
certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State,
or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in
the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. From the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects provided for in this Agreement and in the applicable
provisions of the DGCL, including those set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Certificate of
Merger shall provide that, at the Effective Time, (a) the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended at the Effective
Time to read in its entirety as the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub
in effect prior to the date of this Agreement, except as thereafter amended,
except that _Article I_ thereof shall read as follows: "The name of the
Corporation is Goodman Global, Inc." and except for any references to the
incorporator or original directors of Merger Sub and, as so amended, such
Certificate of Incorporation shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and (b) the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time, will be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation as of the Effective Time, in each case, until changed or amended
as provided therein and in accordance with the DGCL.

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. From and
after the Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation and
the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified.

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub, Parent
or the holders of any securities of the Company:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.1(b)_,
_Section 2.1(d)_ and _Section 2.1(e)_, each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Company Common Stock_ ", and
each, a " _Share_ "), other than any Cancelled Shares (as defined, and to the
extent provided, in Section 2.1(b)) shall thereupon be converted automatically
into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $25.60 in cash
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All Shares that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
this  _Section 2.1_ shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and the holders of certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Shares other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any shares of Company Common
Stock owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company shall remain
outstanding.



 

2 (b) _Parent-Owned and Treasury Shares_. Each Share that is owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time or held by the Company or any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time (in each case, other than any such Shares held on behalf
of third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange for such cancellation and retirement.

(c) _Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation. Such newly issued shares shall thereafter constitute all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

(e) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any
person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(a), but rather the holders of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to such rights (but only such rights) as
granted by Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall
fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder under Section 262
shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted
as of the Effective Time into the right to receive, and to have become
exchangeable solely for, Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
2.1(a)_. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands
received by the  



 

3  Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals
thereof and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 and
received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights
under Section 262\. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld) or as otherwise required
by applicable Law, make any payment with respect to or settle or offer to
settle any such demands.

(f) Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards.

(1) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") granted under the 2004 Stock Option Plan and the
2006 Incentive Award Plan of the Company (together, the " _Company Stock
Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, other than any such option that is subject to an
alternative arrangement specifically agreed to between Parent and the holder
thereof, shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully vested and be
converted into the right to receive at the Effective Time an amount in cash
in U.S. dollars equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and (y) the excess,
if any, of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, with the
aggregate amount of such payment rounded to the nearest cent less such amounts
as are required to be withheld or deducted under the United States Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") or any provision of U.S.
federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such
payment.

(2) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted Company
Common Stock (the " _Restricted Shares_ "), other than any such Restricted
Share that is subject to an alternative arrangement specifically agreed to
between Parent and the holder thereof, shall vest in full and be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in  _Section
2.1(a)_, less such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under
any provision of U.S. federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to
the making of such payment.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to or at the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company (or, with
respect to the amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(f)_ only, such
other agent, which may be the Surviving Corporations payroll agent) that
shall be appointed to act as an exchange agent hereunder and approved in
advance by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned) (and pursuant to an agreement in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) (the " _Exchange Agent_ "),
for the benefit of holders of the Shares, cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to
pay (i) the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled
Shares), payable upon due surrender of the certificates that immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented Shares (" _Certificates_ ") (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II and (ii) the amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(f)_. Any
cash deposited in respect of clause (i) and (ii) above shall hereinafter be
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."



 

4 (b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(1) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Shares whose Shares
were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_,
(A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Parent and the Company may mutually agree), and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration.

(2) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled
to receive in exchange for such properly surrendered Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or such Book-Entry Shares an
amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to this Article II. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or effective
affidavits in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the relevant Merger Consideration to be issued or paid upon due
surrender of the Certificate may be issued or paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes (as
hereinafter defined) have been paid or are not applicable.

(3) The Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any holder of
Shares such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code
or any provision of U.S. state or local Tax Law with respect to the making of
such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid
over to the applicable Governmental Entity (as hereinafter defined), such
withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares, in respect of which
such deduction and withholding were made. 

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the relevant Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Article II.



 

5 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of Shares one year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any
former holders of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance
with this _Section 2.2_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares.

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Exchange Agent or reasonably requested by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate (and such affidavit of loss shall not be deemed effective without
the posting of such bond if required hereunder), the Exchange Agent will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the
amount of the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY

Except as disclosed in reasonable detail in the Companys SEC Documents (as
hereinafter defined) filed prior to the date of this Agreement (other than
disclosure referred to in the "Factors That May Affect Future Results," "Risk
Factors", "Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" or
"Forward-Looking Statements" sections of such Company SEC Documents) or in the
disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement, which shall contain section numbers and
subsections numbered to correspond to the section numbers and subsections of
this Agreement (it being agreed that any information set forth in one section
of such disclosure letter shall be deemed to apply to each other section
thereof to which its relevance is reasonably apparent on its face) (the "
_Company Disclosure Letter_ "), the Company represents and warrants to Parent
as follows:

Section 3.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc_. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good  



 

6  standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and
has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as
a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except (i) in the case of the Company, where the failure
to be so qualified or in good standing and (ii) in the case of any Subsidiary,
where the failure to be so organized, validly existing, qualified or in good

would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.4 _Proxy Statement; Other Information_. None of the information
provided by Parent or its Subsidiaries to be included in the Proxy Statement
will, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or
supplements thereto, and at the time of the Company Meeting (as hereinafter

assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Commitment Letters
inaccurate, (X) result in any of the conditions in the Commitment Letters not
being satisfied, (Y) cause the Commitment Letters to be ineffective, or (Z)
otherwise result in the funding contemplated in the Commitment Letters not
being available on a timely basis in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall amend or
modify any Debt Commitment Letter between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time unless such amendment or modification (a) does not adversely
amend or expand upon the conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth

expected to delay or hinder the Closing and (c) does not reduce the aggregate
amount of available Financing.

Section 4.6 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. As of the date of this Agreement,
the authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common
stock, $0.01 par value per share, all of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is,
and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub has outstanding no option,
warrant, right, or any other agreement pursuant to which any person other than
Parent may acquire any equity security of Merger Sub. Merger Sub has not
conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has, and prior to the
Effective Time will have, no assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature
other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.7 _No Vote of Parent Stockholders_. No vote of the stockholders of

to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.8 _Finders or Brokers_. Neither Parent nor any of its affiliates

transactions contemplated by this Agreement who might be entitled to any fee
or any commission in connection with or upon consummation of the Merger.



 

22 Section 4.9 _Lack of Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Neither Parent nor
Merger Sub beneficially owns or, since January 1, 2007 has beneficially
owned, directly or indirectly, any Shares or other securities convertible
into, exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares. There are no voting trusts
or other agreements or understandings to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the capital stock or
other equity interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 4.10 _WARN Act_. Parent and Merger Sub are neither planning nor
contemplating, and Parent and Merger Sub have neither made nor taken, any
decisions or actions concerning the Employees (as hereinafter defined) after
the Closing that would require the service of notice under the WARN Act or
similar local laws.

Section 4.11 _No Additional Representations_.

(a) Parent acknowledges that it and its Representatives have (i) had full
opportunity to meet with the management of the Company and to discuss the
business, assets and liabilities of the Company and (ii) received access to
such books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets of
the Company which it and its Representatives have desired or requested to
review and access to the data room (including any electronic data room)
maintained in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including written responses to questions submitted by, or on behalf of, Parent
and its Representatives.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in Article III or any other provision
of this Agreement, Parent acknowledges and agrees that neither the
Company nor any person has made any representation or warranty, express or
implied, beyond those expressly given in this Agreement or any certificate
contemplated by this Agreement or to be delivered to Parent in connection
herewith including any implied warranty or representation as to the accuracy
or completeness of any information regarding the Company furnished or made
available to Parent and its Representatives except as expressly set forth in
Article III (which includes the Company Disclosure Letter and the Company SEC
Documents), and neither the Company nor any other person shall be subject to
any liability to Parent or any other person resulting from the Companys
making available to Parent or Parents use of such information. As part of
its investigation of the Company, Parent has been given financial information,
cost estimates, forecasts, projections and other oral or written information
and materials with respect to the Company (the "Additional Financial
Information") by the Company or its agents and representatives. There are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make projections, predictions and
forecasts, and Parent is familiar with such uncertainties. Parent has made its
own evaluation of the Additional Financial Information. None of the Company
and its officers, directors, employees, affiliates, representatives and agents
is making any representations or warranties with respect to the Additional
Financial Information, except for the specific representations and warranties
set forth in Article III.

Section 4.12 _Solvency_. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions to the
obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger, immediately
after giving effect to the  



 

23  transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any financing in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), (i) none
of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries will have incurred
debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature or become due and
the then present fair salable value of the assets of each of the Surviving
Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries will exceed the amount that will be
required to pay its respective probable liabilities (including the probable
amount of all contingent liabilities) and its respective debts as they become
absolute and matured, (ii) the assets of each of the Surviving Corporation
and each of its Subsidiaries, in each case at a fair valuation, will exceed
its respective debts (including the probable amount of all contingent
liabilities) and (iii) none of the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries will have unreasonably small capital to carry on its business as
presently conducted or as proposed to be conducted. No transfer of property is
being made by Parent and Merger Sub and no obligation is being incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by Parent
and Merger Sub with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company. For purposes of this _Section 4.12_, "debts beyond its ability to
pay such debts as they mature or become due" and "unreasonably small capital
to carry on its business as conducted or proposed to be conducted" means that
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not be able to generate
enough cash from operations, asset dispositions or refinancing, or a
combination thereof, to meet its obligations as they become due.

Section 4.13 _Parent Insurance Approval_. Assuming that the representation of
the Company set forth in _Section 3.22_ is true and correct in all respects,
Parent is not aware of any facts or circumstances that it believes would
prohibit the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation review and approval of the
Statement of Acquisition, Merger or Consolidation of a Specialty
Insurer filed pursuant to Fla. Stat. s. 628.4615 relating to AsureCare Corp.

Section 5.2  _Investigation_.

(a) The Company shall afford to Parent and to its directors, officers,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and
agents (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") reasonable access during normal
business hours, upon reasonable advance notice, throughout the period prior to
the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, to the employees,
properties, contracts, commitments, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any report, schedule or other document filed or received by
the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to the requirements of applicable
Laws. Any such investigation and examination shall be conducted so as to
minimize disruption to or impairment of the Companys and its Subsidiaries
business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall (i) not be
required to afford such access if it would, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company, would cause a violation of any agreement to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party prior to the date of this Agreement, or
would constitute a violation of any applicable Law, (ii) require that such
access be afforded only pursuant to the terms of a joint defense agreement if
broader access would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, cause a loss
of legal privilege to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and neither
(iii) Parent nor any of its Representatives shall be permitted to perform any
invasive onsite environmental procedure with respect to any property of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. If, in the course of any investigation
pursuant to this _Section 5.2(a)_, Parent discovers any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Company contained in this
Agreement that Parent believes could prevent a closing condition  



 

28  under _Article VI_ from being satisfied, Parent will promptly inform the
Company of such breach ( _provided_ that, nothing to the contrary
herein withstanding, failure to comply with the foregoing shall be
disregarded for the purposes of the satisfaction or failure of the conditions
contained in _Section 6.2(b)_).

(b) The parties acknowledge that the Company and Parent have previously
executed a Confidentiality Agreement dated June 19, 2007, as amended (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained therein, shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms until the earlier of (x)
the Effective Time and (y) the termination of such Confidentiality Agreement
in accordance with its terms, and Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives to hold, any Evaluation Material (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Subject to _Section 5.3(c)_ through _(f)_ , the Company agrees that
neither it nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall, and that it shall cause
its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate, propose or knowingly encourage or take any other action to
knowingly facilitate any inquiry, discussion, offer or request
that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative
Proposal (as hereinafter defined), or the making, submission or announcement
of, any Alternative Proposal, (ii) participate or otherwise engage in any
negotiations regarding an Alternative Proposal with, or furnish any nonpublic
information to, or afford access to the property, books or records of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to, any person that has made or, to the Companys
knowledge, is considering making an Alternative Proposal or grant any waiver
or release under any standstill, (iii) engage in discussions regarding an
Alternative Proposal with any person that has made or, to the Companys
knowledge, is considering making an Alternative Proposal, except to notify
such person as to the existence of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_, (iv)
approve, endorse or recommend any Alternative Proposal, or (v) enter into any
letter of intent or agreement in principle or any agreement or other
arrangement providing for any Alternative Proposal (except for confidentiality
agreements permitted under _Section 5.3(c)_).

(b) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
after receipt) advise Parent of the receipt of any Alternative Proposal, or of
any inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any request for information
from, or any negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, either the
Company or its Representatives concerning an Alternative Proposal or that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal,
notify Parent orally and in writing and disclose the identity of the other
party and the material terms of such inquiry, offer, proposal or request and,
in the case of written materials provided to the Company, provide Parent
copies of such materials as promptly as reasonably practicable. The Company
shall keep Parent informed on a prompt basis of the status, terms and
substance of any discussions or negotiations (including amendments and
proposed amendments) of any such Alternative Proposal or other inquiry,
offer, proposal or request concerning an Alternative Proposal.



 

29 (c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.3(a)_, if at any
time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
receives an Alternative Proposal which (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal or
(ii) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, the Company may take
the following actions: (x) furnish nonpublic information to the third party
making such Alternative Proposal, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such
information, the Company receives from the third party an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable in any material respect
to the Company than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and provided
that any such information must be provided to Parent as promptly as is
reasonably practicable after its provision to such third party to the extent
not previously made available to Parent and (y) engage in discussions or
negotiations with the third party with respect to the Alternative Proposal,
if, but only if, in the case of both clause (x) and (y) if the Board of
Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys outside legal and financial advisors, that the failure of the
Board of Directors to furnish such information or engage in such discussions
or negotiations would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors exercise of their fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law.

(d) Subject to compliance with the other terms of this _Section 5.3(d)_, in
response to the receipt of a Superior Proposal that has not been withdrawn,
prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the
Company may withdraw, modify or qualify the Company Recommendation (a "
_Change of Recommendation_ ") or approve or recommend a Superior Proposal if
the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors, that the
failure of the Board of Directors to effect a Change of Recommendation or
approve or recommend a Superior Proposal, as applicable, would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary
obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law. The Company
shall not be entitled to effect a Change in Recommendation with respect to a
Superior Proposal or approve or recommend a Superior Proposal unless and until
(A) after the third business day following Parents receipt of a written
notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") from the Company advising Parent
that the Company intends to take such action and describing the material terms
and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action in
such Notice of Superior Proposal and as promptly as practicable thereafter
providing a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the
party making such Superior Proposal and other material documents, and stating
that the Company intends to effect a Change in Recommendation (it being
understood and agreed that (1) the Company shall, and shall cause its
financial and legal advisors to, during such three-business day period,
negotiate with Parent and Merger Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent and
Merger Sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Alternative Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal, (2) in determining whether to cause or permit
the Company to effect a Change in Recommendation or approve or recommend a
Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) of the
Company shall take into account any changes to the financial terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company in any bona fide written proposal
in response to a Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, and (3) any
material amendment to the financial terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new forty-eight hour period),
and (B) the Company has complied in all material respects with this _Section
5.3_. In addition, the Board of Directors of the Company  



 

30  shall not approve or recommend a Superior Proposal unless the Company
immediately terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_. Except
as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_, neither the Board of Directors
of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) effect a Change of
Recommendation or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or qualify the
Company Recommendation or (ii) approve, recommend or adopt or publicly
propose to approve, recommend or adopt any Superior Proposal.

(e) Subject to the provisions of _Section 5.3(d)_, nothing in this Agreement
shall prohibit or restrict the Board of Directors of the Company from making a
Change of Recommendation to the extent that (i) such Change of Recommendation
does not arise out of or relate to an Alternative Proposal and (ii) the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of
Directors of the Company to effect a Change of Recommendation would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their
fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure (other than (x) a "stop,
look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or (y) a negative
recommendation of such tender offer) shall be deemed to be an Change in
Recommendation; _provided_ , further, that the Board of Directors of the
Company shall not (A) recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender
their shares of Company Common Stock in connection with such tender or
exchange offer (or otherwise approve or recommend any Alternative Proposal) or
(B) effect a Change in Recommendation, unless in each case the applicable
requirements of _Section 5.3(d)_ shall have been satisfied.

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any
proposal or offer made by any person or "group" (as defined under Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act) (other than a proposal or offer by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries) for any transaction or proposed transaction or series of
related transactions involving (i) a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, or similar transaction
(each, a " _Fundamental Change Transaction_ ") involving the Company or any
Company Significant Subsidiary, in each case involving the ownership of twenty
percent (20%) of such entity or a transaction in which holders of Common Stock
prior to such transaction would own (in substantially the same proportion as
prior to such transaction), less than 80% of the common or voting stock of the
resulting or surviving entity, (ii) the acquisition by any person or "group"
of twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (including for this purpose the outstanding
assets and equity securities of the Company Subsidiaries) or (iii) the direct
or indirect acquisition by any person or "group" of beneficial ownership of
twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding shares of any class of capital
stock of the Company or any Company Significant Subsidiary or twenty percent
(20%) or more of the voting power represented by the outstanding voting
securities of the Company or any Company Significant Subsidiary.



 

31 (h) As used in this Agreement " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean an
Alternative Proposal (provided that (x) for the purposes of clause (i)
thereof, such Fundamental Change Transaction must result in a third party
acquiring more than 50% of the outstanding shares of any class of capital
stock of the Company or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (y) for the purposes of clauses
(ii) and (iii) thereof, substituting the words "fifty percent (50%)" in place
of "twenty percent (20%)" where such words appear in such clauses) made by
any person on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial and legal
advisors, would if consummated, result in a transaction that is (A) more
favorable to the Company and its stockholders from a financial point of view
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any adjustment
to the terms and conditions proposed by Parent in response to such proposal),
taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement, including any break-up and reverse fees, expense reimbursement or
similar provisions and (B) reasonably capable of being consummated in a
timely manner on the terms proposed, in each case taking into account all
financial (including the financing terms of such proposal), regulatory, legal
and other aspects of such proposal.

Section 5.4 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_.

(a) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof, but in no event later than twenty (20) business days, prepare
and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement which shall, subject to _Section
5.3_, include the Company Recommendation, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to respond to any comments by the SEC staff in respect of the Proxy
Statement as promptly as reasonably practicable. Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide to the Company such information as the Company may reasonably request
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall notify Parent promptly
of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request
by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement
or for additional information and shall supply Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable after filing with the SEC. If at any time prior to
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval there shall occur any event that
should, upon the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy
Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, the Company shall promptly prepare, file with the
SEC and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement or any other SEC filing required in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby (or, in each case, any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the party responsible for filing or mailing such document shall
provide the other party an opportunity to review and comment on such document
or response and shall consider in good faith comments reasonably proposed by
the other party.



 

32 (b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in order to lift
any injunctions or remove any other impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company
shall (i) take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Law and its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Meeting_ ") and (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall include the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement,
in each case for this clause (ii), so long as there has not been a Change
in Recommendation expressly permitted by _Section 5.3_. The obligation of
the Company to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Company Meeting shall not be affected by a Change in
Recommendation unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1_. Without the prior written consent of Parent, adoption of this Agreement
is the only matter (other than procedural matters) which the Company shall
propose to be acted on by the Company Stockholders at the Company Meeting.

Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor all employment
agreements, retention agreements and severance agreements in accordance
with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. For a
period of one (1) year from the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall
cause to be provided, to each current and former employee of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, other than such employees covered by collective bargaining
agreements (" _Company Employees_ "), cash compensation (including, without
limitation, base salary, base wages and annual incentive compensation
opportunities) and employee benefits provided under the Company Benefit Plans
listed in _Section 3.8(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (but, for greater
clarity, excluding any equity-based awards and equity-based incentives) that
are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation and benefits
provided to such Company Employees immediately before the Effective Time.
Parent agrees to the additional matters set forth on _Section 5.5(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

(b) For at least (1) year from the Effective Time, Parent shall not terminate
or otherwise amend, nor permit to be terminated or otherwise amended, the
Companys severance arrangements in a manner adverse to any officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries covered by such
arrangements set forth on _Section 5.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing contained in this _Section
5.5 _shall create any rights in any Company Employee in respect of continued
employment for any specified period of any nature or kind whatsoever or,
except as set forth in the preceding sentence, limit Parents or the
Companys power to amend or terminate any particular employment agreement,
Company Benefit Plan or New Plan or require (and the Company shall take no
action that would require) Parent, any member of Parents "controlled group"
within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code, or the Company or its
Subsidiaries to continue any particular Company Benefit Plan or New Plan.



 

33 (c) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and benefits level) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall, subject to
applicable Law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be credited
with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as
such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for
such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent
that its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to
the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, (A) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in each New Plan to the extent coverage
under such New Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which such
Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior
to consummation of the Merger, and (B) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively at work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Company Benefit Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(d) All annual bonus plans for Company Employees for 2007 will be continued in
accordance with their terms. If the Effective Time occurs during or after
December 2007, the Company shall be permitted to establish annual bonus plans
for 2008 based upon targets and goals determined using comparable methodology
and business measurements as used for the 2007 bonus plans; _provided_ , that
Parent has the opportunity to review and comment on such annual bonus plans
and programs, including targets and goals, and consents (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld) before such plans and policies, including
targets and goals, are finalized and implemented. In accordance with the
Goodman Global, Inc. 2007 Performance Bonus Program (the " _2007 Bonus Plan_
"), the applicable portion of the bonuses due under the 2007 bonus plans shall
be paid by the Company not later than November 30, 2007 (based upon applicable
performance as determined by the Company consistent with past practice, with
bonuses based on "Enterprise EBITDA" payable under the 2007 Bonus Plan paid at
target plus/max performance levels) to each Company Employee then employed and
then participating in the 2007 Bonus Plan. The balance of any bonus payable
under the 2007 Bonus Plan with respect to the 2007 calendar year (based upon
applicable performance as determined by the Company in accordance with the
2007 Bonus Plan) shall be paid based on actual performance by the Company to
each Company Employee then employed immediately prior to the Effective Time,
or, if earlier, when bonuses under the 2007 Bonus Plan would ordinarily be
paid in accordance with the terms thereof. Company performance in respect of
calculations made under the bonus plans for the calendar year 2007 shall be
calculated without taking into account any expenses or costs associated with
or arising as a result of transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
non-recurring charges that would not reasonably be expected to have been  



 

34  incurred had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred,
and bonuses under the 2007 bonus plans shall not be subject to negative
discretion by the administrator for the bonus plans.

(e) _No Third Party Beneficiaries; No Amendments_. Nothing in this _Section
5.5_, whether express or implied, shall be construed (i) to give any person
other than the parties to this Agreement any legal or equitable right or
remedy under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this
Agreement, (ii) to give to any person any legal or equitable right to
continued employment or (iii) to constitute an amendment to or modification of
any Company Benefit Plan.

Section 5.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in
accordance with, applicable Law) to take, or cause to be taken, promptly all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, promptly and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining
of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals,
including the Company Approvals, the Parent Approvals and the approval of the
Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, from Governmental Entities and the
making of all necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps
as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the
defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) promptly make their respective
filings and thereafter make any other required submissions under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the " _HSR Act_ "), (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (x) determining
whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents, permits,
authorizations, waivers or approvals are required to be obtained from, any
third parties or other Governmental Entities under any other applicable
Regulatory Law in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(y) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such consents,
permits, authorizations or approvals, (iii) use reasonable best efforts to
offer to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be
done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including taking
all such further action as reasonably may be necessary to resolve
such objections, if any, as the United States Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, state antitrust
enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or
other jurisdiction or any other person may assert under Regulatory Law with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental  



 

35  Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as
soon as expeditiously possible (and in any event no later than the End Date
(as hereinafter defined)), including, without limitation (x) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or
businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company or
its Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that
after the Closing Date would limit the freedom of Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporations) or affiliates freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporations) businesses, product lines or assets,
in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order
in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the effect of preventing
or materially delaying the Closing, and (iv) subject to applicable legal
limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, keep each other
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including promptly furnishing
the other with copies of notices or other communications between the Company
or Parent and their representatives and counsel, as the case may be, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, and any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity with respect to such transactions, _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials may be (x) redacted as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, and (y)
limited to disclosure pursuant to a joint defense agreement to address
reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns. Parent and the Company may,
as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively
sensitive or any confidential business material provided to the other under
this _Section 5.6(b)_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel
of the recipient and shall not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials or its legal counsel. The
Company and Parent shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable
opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other party in connection with, any proposed written communication to any
Governmental Entity. Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to participate
in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone,
with any Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transactions
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 5.6_, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of the Company and Parent
shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section
5.6_ shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(c)_ so long as such party has, prior to
such termination, complied with its obligations under this _Section 5.6_.



 

36 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except as
contemplated under  _Section 5.11_, in connection with obtaining any
approval or consent from any person (other than a Governmental Entity) with
respect to the Merger, which approval or consent is not a condition to the
consummation of the Merger pursuant to Article VI, (i) without the prior
written consent of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to
pay to such person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or
other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other
obligation due to such person or materially modify any Contract and (ii)
neither Parent nor any of its affiliates shall be required to pay or
commit to pay to such person whose approval or consent is being solicited any
cash or other consideration, make any commitment or to incur any liability or
other obligation.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means the Sherman Act
of 1890, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act of 1914 and all other federal, state or foreign statutes,
rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and
other Laws, including without limitation any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation Laws, that are designed or intended to (i) prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade or lessening competition through merger or acquisition, or (ii)
protect the national security or the national economy of any nation.

Section 5.7 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of
the Company and Parent and the members of their respective Boards of Directors
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary
so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent will consult with
and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press
release or other public statement prior to the issuance of such press release
or other public statement relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or
other public statement prior to such consultation except as may be required by
applicable Law or by any national securities exchange. Parent and the Company
agree to issue a joint press release announcing this Agreement.

Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former
directors or officers, as the case may be, of the Company or its Subsidiaries
with respect to Actions arising from their pre-Effective Time service in such
capacities as provided in their respective certificate of incorporation
or bylaws or other organization documents or in any agreement, arrangement or
understanding to which the Company or one of its Subsidiaries is a party shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period
of six (6) years from the Effective  



 

37  Time, Parent shall maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and any
Company Subsidiarys certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organization documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or in
any indemnification agreements, arrangements and understandings of the Company
or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors or officers in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to Actions arising
from their pre-Effective Time service in such capacities, and shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions or the exculpation,
indemnification or advancement of expenses provisions of the Surviving
Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the
Effective Time were current or former directors or officers of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries with respect to Actions arising from their pre-
Effective Time service in such capacities; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any
claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such
Action or resolution of such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall be jointly and severally liable along with the Surviving Corporation
for each of the covenants contained in this _Section 5.9_ in accordance with
their respective terms, without limit as to time.

(b) At and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold
harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the foregoing) each current
director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together
with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating
to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have
occurred, whether before or after the Effective Time, with respect to such
Indemnified Partys actions or omissions taken in his or her capacity as
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Indemnified Party to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent then required by
the DGCL, to repay such advances if it is finally judicially determined that
such person is not entitled to indemnification. In the event of any such
Action, at and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
assume the defense of such Action and the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense of any such Action. the
Surviving Corporation shall not settle any such Action without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party unless the Surviving Corporation
assumes full responsibility for such settlement, the settlement grants the
Indemnified Party a complete release in respect of the potential liability
relating to the claims underlying such Action and the terms of such
settlement are not in any way detrimental to the Indemnified Party and such
settlement does not contain any admission detrimental to the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnified Party shall not settle any such Action without
the prior written consent of the Surviving Corporation unless such settlement
does not provide for monetary damages, the terms of such settlement do not
include any equitable remedies or restrictions on the Surviving Corporation or
its subsidiaries and are otherwise not in any way detrimental to the
Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries and such settlement does not contain
any admission detrimental to the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries.



 

38 (c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect insurance policies with
respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time in an amount and
scope at least as favorable as the coverage applicable as of the date hereof
under such policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date hereof in respect of the coverages required to be obtained pursuant
hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Company may satisfy its
obligations under this _Section 5.9(c)_ by purchasing a "tail" policy under
the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy which (i)
has an effective term of six years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers those
persons who are currently covered by the Companys directors and officers
insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof for actions and omissions
occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) contains terms and
conditions that are no less favorable to the insured than those of
the Companys directors and officers insurance policy in effect as of the
date hereof.

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 5.9_.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may
have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other organization
documents of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, any other
indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this
_Section 5.9_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are
intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to
the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their officers, directors or
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this _Section 5.9_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such
claims under such policies.

Section 5.10 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
Companys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.



 

39 Section 5.11 _Financing_.

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letters in
a timely manner (taking into account the expected timing of the Marketing
Period), including (A) using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contained therein or on other terms no less favorable to Parent, (ii) to
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent in such
definitive agreements that are within its control and (iii) upon the
satisfaction of such conditions, to use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the funding of such Debt Financing and (B) seeking to enforce its rights under
the Debt Commitment Letters. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment
Letters or any Debt Commitment Letter shall be terminated or modified in a
manner materially adverse to Parent for any reason, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain financing from alternative
sources upon terms no less favorable to Parent or Merger Sub as those
contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and in an amount sufficient to fund
the Required Amount (" _Alternate Financing_ ") and to obtain, and, if
obtained, will provide the Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment
that provides for at least the same amount of financing as such Debt
Commitment Letter as originally issued, to the extent needed to fund the
Required Amount, and on terms and conditions (including economic terms and
termination rights and funding conditions) no less favorable to Parent or
Merger Sub than those included in the Debt Commitment Letters (the " _New Debt
Commitment Letter_ "). To the extent applicable, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange promptly and consummate the
Alternate Financing on the terms and conditions described in any New Debt
Commitment Letter in a timely manner (taking into account the expected timing
of the Marketing Period), including using reasonable best efforts to (i)
negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained therein or on other terms no less favorable to Parent,
(ii) to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent or
Merger Sub in such definitive agreements that are within its control and (iii)
upon the satisfaction of such conditions, to use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the funding of such Alternate Financing. In the event Alternate
Financing is obtained and a New Debt Commitment Letter is entered into,
references in this Agreement to the Debt Commitment Letters shall be deemed
to include a reference to the New Debt Commitment Letter, to the extent
applicable. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably apprised of material
developments relating to the Financing, and shall give the Company prompt
notice of any material adverse change with respect to such Financing. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in
any event within two Business Days, if at any time (i) any Commitment Letter
shall expire or be terminated for any reason, (ii) any financing source that
is a party to any Commitment Letter notifies Parent or Merger Sub that such
source no longer intends to provide financing on the terms set forth therein,
or (iii) for any reason Parent no longer believes in good faith that it will
be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letters on the terms described therein. Parent shall not, and shall
not permit any of its affiliates to, without the prior written consent of the
Company, take or fail to take any action or enter into any transaction,
including any merger, acquisition or joint venture, disposition, lease,
contract or debt or equity financing, that could reasonably be expected
to materially impair, delay or prevent the consummation of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letters. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Marketing Period" shall mean the first period of 30 consecutive calendar days
throughout which (1) Parent shall have the Required Financial Information
that the Company is  



 

40  required to provide to Parent pursuant to _Section 5.11(b)_ and (2) the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ shall be satisfied and nothing has
occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the conditions set
forth in _Section 6.3_ (other than the conditions set forth in _Section
6.3(c)_ and _Section 6.3(d)_) to fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing
were to be scheduled for any time during such 30-consecutive-calendar-day
period; provided, that (A) if the Marketing Period has not ended on or prior
to December 22, 2007, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than
January 7, 2008; (B) the "Marketing Period" shall not be deemed to have
commenced if, prior to the completion of the Marketing Period, Ernst and Young
LLP shall have withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any financial
statements contained in the Company SEC Reports; (C) that (except as provided
in clause (E) below) in no event will the Marketing Period end earlier than
five (5) Business Days after delivery of the certificate referred to in
_Section 5.11(c)(x)_ or, to the extent the Closing has not occurred prior to
the completion of the Companys 2007 audited financial statements, _Section
5.11(c)(y)_; (D) in no event will the Marketing Period begin prior to the
earlier of (I) the receipt of the Insurance Approval by Parent and Sponsor and
(II) February 8, 2008; and (E) that the "Marketing Period" shall end on any
earlier date on which the Debt Financing is consummated. 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Representatives, including legal and accounting advisors, to
provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
Financing (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries),
including (i) assisting in the preparation for, and participating in, a
reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence
sessions and similar presentations to and with, among others, prospective
lenders, investors and rating agencies, (ii) assisting with the preparation of
customary materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents,
private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda (including the
delivery of a customary representation letter as contemplated by the Senior
Debt Commitment Letter), prospectuses and similar documents required in
connection with the Financing, (iii) executing and delivering any pledge and
security documents, other definitive financing documents, or other
certificates, legal opinions or documents as may be reasonably requested by
Parent (including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company
or any Subsidiary with respect to solvency matters and consents of
accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt
Financing) and otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral,
(iv) furnishing Parent and its Financing sources with financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by
Parent, including all financial statements and financial data required by
Exhibit D of the Senior Debt Commitment Letter and Exhibit C of the
Subordinated Debt Commitment Letter (in each case, within the time frames
described therein) (the "Required Financial Information"), (v) using
reasonable best efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters, legal
opinions, surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent, (vi)
providing unaudited consolidated monthly financial statements of the Company
(excluding footnotes) consisting of a balance sheet, income statement and
statement of cash flows for each month within the time frames described in
Exhibit D of the Senior Debt Commitment Letter and Exhibit C of the
Subordinated Debt Commitment Letter, (vii) taking all actions reasonably
necessary to (A) permit the prospective lenders involved in the Financing to
evaluate the Companys inventory, current assets, cash management and
accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto for the purpose
of establishing collateral arrangements (including conducting the  



 

41  commercial finance examination and inventory appraisal contemplated by the
Senior Commitment Letter within the time frame described therein) and (B)
establish bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements in connection
with the foregoing, and (viii) taking all corporate actions, subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, necessary to permit the consummation of the
Debt Financing and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to the
Company, including the entering into one or more credit agreements or other
instruments on terms satisfactory to Parent in connection with the Debt
Financing immediately prior to the Effective Time to the extent direct
borrowings or debt incurrence by the Company is contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letters; provided, that, none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective officers, advisors
or representatives shall be required to pay any commitment or similar fee or
incur any other liability in connection with the Financing prior to the
Effective Time. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the consummation of
the Merger, Parent or Merger Sub shall, promptly upon request by the Company,
reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Company in connection with such cooperation. If the Effective
Time does not occur, the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
officers, advisors and representatives shall be indemnified and held harmless
by Parent for and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the Debt Financing (other than to the
extent such losses arises from the willful misconduct of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, advisors and
representatives) and any information utilized in connection therewith (other
than information provided by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries). The
Company hereby consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in
connection with the Debt Financing; provided, that, such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All non-public or otherwise
confidential information regarding the Company obtained by Parent, Merger Sub
or their respective officers, advisors or representatives shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if, in connection with a marketing effort for the
syndicated credit facilities contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter,
Parent requests the Company to file a report on Form 8-K pursuant to the
Exchange Act that contains material non-public information with respect to the
Company, which Parent reasonably determines to include in a customary
"public" bank information memorandum for such facilities, then, upon the
Companys review of and reasonable satisfaction with such filing (it being
acknowledged and agreed that such filing shall contain all reasonable
comments of the Company), the Company shall file such report on Form 8-K.

(c) No later than five (5) Business Days of (x) the delivery of monthly
financial statements for December 2007 pursuant to _Section 5.11(b)_ and (y),
to the extent that the Closing has not occurred prior to the completion of the
Companys 2007 audited financial statements, the completion of such audited
financial statements, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate
executed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company setting forth the
EBITDA (as such term is defined in  _Section 6.3(d)_) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, calculated on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, for the twelve-month
period ended December 31, 2007, together with supporting calculations in
reasonable detail.



 

42 Section 5.12 _Company Notes_.

(a) No later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the date of the Company
Meeting, the Company shall cause Goodman Global Holdings, Inc. (" _Holdings_
") to launch tender offers and Consent Solicitations (the " _Debt Tender
Offers_ ") for all of the outstanding Senior Floating Rate Notes due 2012 of 
_Holdings_ (the " _Floating Notes_ ") and all of the outstanding 7 7/8% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2012 of Holdings (the " _Fixed Notes_ " and, together
with the Floating Notes, the " _Tender Offer Notes_ "), on the terms set forth
on _Section 5.12_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, and otherwise
in compliance with applicable Law and SEC rules and regulations, and Parent
and Merger Sub shall assist the Company and Holdings in connection therewith.

(b) Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Parent shall prepare all
necessary and appropriate documentation in connection with the Debt Tender
Offers, including the offer to purchase, any related letters of transmittal
and other related documents (collectively, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and such
documents shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. Parent and the
Company shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the
Offer Documents. All mailings to the holders of the Tender Offer Notes in
connection with the Debt Tender Offers shall be subject to the prior review
and comment by each of the Company and Parent, subject to the terms and
conditions of  _Section 5.12_, and shall be reasonably acceptable to each of
them. The closing of the Debt Tender Offers shall be conditioned on the
conditions set forth in _Section 5.12(d)_. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall cooperate in connection with the Debt Tender Offers in order to cause
the consent date under the Consent Solicitation to occur as directed by Parent
prior to or concurrently with the Closing and the initial settlement of the
Debt Tender Offers to occur concurrently with the Closing. The Company shall
cause Holdings to waive any of the conditions to the Debt Tender Offers (other
than that the Merger shall have occurred or that the Parent and Company shall
be satisfied that it shall occur substantially concurrently with the closing
of the Debt Tender Offers, the Requested Consents shall have been received,
and that there shall be no order or injunction prohibiting consummation of the
Debt Tender Offers) as may be reasonably requested by Parent and so long as
such waivers would not cause the Debt Tender Offers to violate the Exchange
Act, the Trust Indenture Act, or any other Law and shall not, without the
consent of Parent, waive any condition to the Debt Tender Offers or make any
changes to the terms and conditions of the Debt Tender Offers other than as
agreed between Parent and the Company. Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence, the Company need not make any change to the terms and
conditions of the Debt Tender Offers requested by Parent that decreases the
price per Note payable in the Debt Tender Offers or imposes conditions to the
Debt Tender Offers in addition to those set forth in _Section 5.12_ of the
Company Disclosure Letters that are materially adverse to holders of the
Tender Offer Notes, unless such change is approved in advance by the Company
in writing. If, at any time prior to the completion of the Debt Tender Offers,
any information in the Offer Documents should be discovered by the Company or
Parent that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Offer
Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
disseminated by Holdings to the holders of the Tender Offer Notes.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.12_, Holdings
shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14el under the Exchange Act and
any other applicable Law to the extent  



 

43  such Laws are applicable in connection with the Debt Tender Offers. To the
extent that the provisions of any applicable Law conflict with this  _Section
5.12_, the Company shall comply with the applicable Law and shall not be
deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder by such compliance.

(c) Promptly upon the receipt of the Requested Consents with respect to the
Indenture for the Floating Notes or the Indenture for the Fixed Notes, the
Company shall cause Holdings to enter into a supplemental indenture or
supplemental indentures reflecting the amendments to such indentures approved
by such Requested Consent and the Company shall cause Holdings to use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the relevant indenture trustee to promptly
enter into such supplemental indenture or supplemental indentures; _provided_
, that the amendments contained in such supplemental indentures shall become
operative upon the acceptance of the applicable Debt Tender Offers and payment
for the Tender Offer Notes tendered pursuant thereto.

(d) The closing of any Debt Tender Offer and the obligation of the Company to
accept for payment and pay for the Tendered Notes shall be conditioned on (i)
the occurrence of the Closing, (ii) the obtaining of the Debt Financing, (iii)
the receipt of the Requested Consents, (iv) there being no order or injunction
prohibiting consummation of the Debt Tender Offer and (v) such other
conditions as are customary for transactions similar to the Debt Tender

actions so that all Tender Offer Notes not tendered and accepted for payment
in the Debt Tender Offers as of the Closing Date are called for redemption
(with redemption to occur on the earliest date permitted under the applicable
Indenture) and satisfied and discharged pursuant to the applicable Indenture
at the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _that_ , prior to Holdings being
required to issue any irrevocable notice of redemption with respect to any
such series of Tender Offer Notes, which redemption cannot be conditioned upon
the occurrence of the Closing, Parent shall have, or shall have caused to be,
deposited with the trustee under the applicable Indenture sufficient funds to
effect such redemption, satisfaction and/or discharge.

its Subsidiaries officers, directors, employees or representatives.

Directors of the Company shall take all such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

not otherwise publicly available regarding Parent, its affiliates or their
respective personnel.

cured by the End Date or is not the subject of a diligent effort by Parent to
cure the same, _provided_ that the Company shall have given Parent written
notice, delivered at least thirty (30) days prior to such termination,

after such termination, provided that the Companys right to receive the
Parent Termination Fee and the expense reimbursement pursuant to _Section
7.2(d)_ shall terminate and  



 

50  be of no further force or effect if, following any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)(ii)_, the Company either (x) fails to
include a Parent Termination Fee Notice in connection with such termination by
the Company or (y) makes any demand or claim for Company Damages under the
Limited Guarantee or in any Action other than for the payment of the Parent
Termination Fee and expense reimbursement pursuant to _Sections 5.11, 5.12 or
7.2(d)_. In the event the Company delivers a Parent Termination Fee Notice,

their respective current, former or future directors, officers, employees,
agents, partners, managers, members, affiliates, stockholders, assignees,
representatives or affiliates for any loss or damage suffered in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (" _Company
Damages_ "). In the event that Parent fails to pay the Parent Termination Fee
and/or the expense reimbursement pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_ when the
payment thereof is not the subject of a bona fide dispute, the Company shall
be entitled to seek and receive, in addition to the Parent Termination Fee
and/or the expense reimbursement pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_, interest
thereon and the Companys costs and expenses of collection thereof (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses). Subject to the terms of this
Agreement (including _Section 7.3(e)_ and the last sentence of _Section
7.1_), the Company shall be entitled to enforce all of its rights under this
Agreement in the event that the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(e)(ii)_ and does not deliver a Parent Termination Fee Notice.

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.1(e)(ii)_ and the Company delivers a Parent Termination Fee Notice
in accordance with the requirements of _Sections 7.1(e)(ii)_ and _Section
7.2(c)_, then Parent shall also promptly (and in any event within two (2)
Business Days of such termination) pay the Company $5,000,000 in reimbursement
of expenses incurred by the Company in connection with this Agreement.

(e) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the
maximum aggregate liability of Parent and Merger Sub for all Company Damages
shall be limited to $139,200,000 (the " _Parent Liability Limitation_ "), and
in no event shall the Company or any Company Subsidiaries seek any other
Company Damages or any other recovery, judgment, or damages of any
kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against Parent,
Merger Sub or any Sponsor or Parent Affiliate in excess of the Parent
Liability Limitation in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) the Company acknowledges and agrees that it has
no right of recovery against, and no personal liability shall attach to, in
each case with respect to Company Damages, Sponsor or the former, current or
future stockholders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or
assignees of Sponsor or Parent or any former, current or future stockholder,
controlling person, director, officer, employee, general or limited partner,
member, manager, affiliate, agent or assignee of any of the foregoing (each a
" _Sponsor or Parent Affiliate_ "), through the Parent or otherwise, whether
by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim
by or on behalf of the Parent against Sponsor or Parent Affiliate, by the
enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by
virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable law, or otherwise, except for
its rights to recover from Sponsor (but not any Sponsor or Parent Affiliate
(including any general partner or managing member)) under and to the extent
provided in the Limited Guarantee of Sponsor for benefit of the Company dated
the date hereof (the "Limited Guarantee") and subject  



 

51  to the Parent Liability Limitation and the other limitations described
therein. Recourse against the Sponsor under the Limited Guarantee shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and all of its affiliates against
Sponsor and Parent Affiliates in respect of any liabilities or obligations
arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

changed address of which no notice was given shall be deemed to be receipt of
the notice as of the date of such rejection, refusal or inability to deliver.

Section 8.8 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 8.9  _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
held to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement in such jurisdiction and in any other
jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the exhibits and schedules hereto) and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and,
except for the provisions of _Section 5.9_ (which shall be for the benefit of
the Indemnified Parties), is not intended to and shall not confer upon any
person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.



 

54 Section 8.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by the Company and Parent, or, in the case of a waiver, by the
party against whom the waiver is to be effective;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment
or waiver shall by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the New York Stock Exchange require further approval of the
stockholders of the Company, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver
shall be subject to such approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure
or delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

Section 8.12 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

drafted by all the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.
