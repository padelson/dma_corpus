written notice of its disagreement with the Post-Closing Business Customer
Rebates Amount set forth in the Preliminary Rebate Statement (the "
_Purchaser s Rebate Dispute Report_") within the 30-day period following
Purchasers receipt of the Preliminary Rebate Statement, the Post-Closing
Business Customer Rebates Amount shown on the Preliminary Rebate Statement
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties as of the last day of

the Subsidiaries (and their officers, employees, accountants and
representatives) reasonably requested by the other party or such partys
accountants in connection with the preparation or review of the Preliminary
Rebate Statement, the Purchasers Rebate Dispute Report and any other response
thereto and in connection with the preparation or review of any submissions
pursuant to this Section 1.9. Purchaser and Seller shall use good faith
efforts to resolve the Disputed Rebate Matters specified in the Purchasers
Rebate Dispute Report (the " _Disputed Rebate Matters_ "), and any resolution
in writing between them as to a Disputed Rebate Matter shall be final, binding
and conclusive on the parties hereto, and Seller shall modify and redeliver
to Purchaser the Preliminary Rebate Statement reflecting such resolution. If
Purchaser and Seller resolve all Disputed Rebate Matters, the Preliminary
Rebate Statement, as modified to reflect such resolution, will become final,
binding and conclusive on the date on which all such Disputed Rebate Matters
are resolved in writing.   

(g) If, after 15 days following Purchasers delivery of the Purchasers Rebate
Dispute Report, Purchaser and Seller are unable to resolve any Disputed
Rebate Matter, such Disputed Rebate Matter shall be referred to the

shall become final and binding in accordance with Section 1.9(j) below.   

(h) The Arbitrator shall be instructed to use every reasonable effort to make
its determination (in compliance with this Section 1.9) with respect to each
Disputed Rebate Matter (the " _Rebate Determination_ ") within 30 days of the
submission to the Arbitrator of the Disputed Rebate Matters. Purchaser and
Seller shall cooperate fully with the Arbitrator and furnish all information
and documents and access at all reasonable times to the books,
records, accounts and facilities of Seller, the Companies and the
Subsidiaries (and their officers, employees, accountants (subject to
compliance with such accountants customary procedures for discussions and,
if applicable, release of work papers) and representatives) as
reasonably requested by the Arbitrator for the purpose of reviewing
submissions to it and making the Rebate Determination.   

(i) Purchaser and Seller shall each submit a binder to the Arbitrator promptly
(and in any event within seven days after the Arbitrators engagement), which
binder shall contain such partys calculation of the Post-Closing Business
Customer Rebates Amount, including information, arguments and support for
such partys position; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchasers computations
reflected in its binder must match those set forth in Purchasers Rebate
Dispute Report or agreed to with Seller pursuant to Section 1.9(f) above, and
Sellers computations reflected in its binder must match those set forth in
the Preliminary Rebate Statement or agreed to with Purchaser pursuant to
Section 1.9(f) above. The Arbitrator will (i) review the Preliminary Rebate
Statement, the Post-Closing Business Customer Rebates Amount, Purchasers and
Sellers binders and the Purchasers Rebate Dispute Report; (ii) determine
(1) whether Sellers proposed amount for each individual item in the
Preliminary Rebate Statement or Purchasers proposed adjustment thereto in
the Purchasers Rebate Dispute Report is calculated more nearly in
accordance with this Section 1.9, and (2) whether there were mathematical
errors in the Preliminary Rebate Statement; (iii) prepare a statement of the
Post-Closing Business Customer Rebates Amount (the " _Final Rebate Statement_
"), which will include each amount in the Preliminary Rebate Statement that
was accepted by Purchaser, each adjustment otherwise agreed to in writing
by Purchaser and Seller pursuant to Section 1.9(f), each amount included in
the Preliminary Rebate Statement that the Arbitrator determines was
calculated more nearly in accordance with this Section 1.9 and each amount in
the Purchasers Rebate Dispute Report that the Arbitrator determines
was calculated more nearly in accordance with this Section 1.9; and (iv)
deliver notice of the Rebate Determination, which shall include the final
Post-Closing Business Customer Rebates Amount as determined by the Arbitrator
in accordance with this Section 1.9 and the Final Rebate Statement, together

(j) After completing the Rebate Determination, the Arbitrator shall deliver
notice of the Rebate Determination (including the final Post-Closing Business
Customer Rebates Amount, the Final Rebate Statement and the report referenced
in Section 1.9(i) above) to Purchaser and Seller, and upon receipt thereof,
the Rebate Determination, such Final Rebate Statement and final Post-
Closing Business Customer Rebates Amount shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties hereto. The costs, fees and expenses of the
Arbitrator shall be allocated between Purchaser and Seller by the Arbitrator
so that the amount of such costs, fees and expenses paid by Purchaser bears
the same proportion to the total costs, fees and expenses of the Arbitrator
as the aggregate dollar amount of the Disputed Rebate Matters unsuccessfully
disputed by Purchaser (as determined by the Arbitrator) bears to the
aggregate dollar amount of all Disputed Rebate Matters, and Seller will pay
the remainder of such costs, fees and expenses. All disputes with respect to
the Preliminary Rebate Statement and the Post-Closing Business Customer
Rebates Amount will be resolved in accordance with this Section 1.9.   

(k) Within three business days after the date on which the Post-Closing
Business Customer Rebates Amount is finally determined in accordance with

amount in U.S. dollars equal to the Post-Closing Business Customer Rebates
Amount.
