                                         may disclose such Buyer Confidential Information to the extent legally required; provided,
                                         however, that the Company will, and will cause its Representatives to, use reasonable

                                         by each Person to whom the Company or any of its Representatives discloses such Buyer

                                         5.4(c)) or any other Transaction Agreement (other than the Letter Agreement) shall restrict

                                         The Parties agree that the foregoing covenants in Section 5.14 impose a reasonable restraint
                                         on the Company in light of the activities and operations of the Business and the Buyer
                                         and the Buyer Designees on the date of the execution of this Agreement and the current
                                         plans of the Business and the Buyer and the Buyer Designees; but it is also the intent
                                         of the Parties that such covenants be construed and enforced in accordance with the changing
                                         activities and business of the Business and the Buyer and its Affiliates throughout the
                                         term of this covenant.(c) In the event that any court of competent jurisdiction shall
                                         determine that the scope, time or territorial restrictions set forth in this Section
                                         5.14 are unreasonable, then it is the intention of the Parties that such restrictions
                                         be enforced to the fullest extent which the court deems reasonable, and the Agreement
                                         shall thereby be reformed.(d) The covenants in this Section 5.14 shall be construed as
                                         agreements independent of any other provision in this Agreement, and the existence of
                                         any claim or cause of action of the Company against the Buyer or its Affiliates, whether
                                         predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement
                                         by the Buyer or its Affiliates of such covenants. The Parties expressly acknowledge that
                                         the terms and conditions of this Section 5.14 are independent of the terms and conditions
                                         of any other agreements including, but not limited to, any employment agreements entered
                                         into in connection with this Agreement. It is specifically agreed that the periods set
                                         forth in this Section 5.14 during which the agreements and covenants made in this Section
                                         5.14 shall be effective, shall be computed by excluding from such computation any time
                                         during which the Company or any of its present or future Affiliates is found by a court
                                         of competent jurisdiction to have been in violation of this Section 5.14. The covenants
                                         contained in this Section 5.14 shall not be affected by any breach of any other provision
                                         hereof by any party hereto.(e) The Company agrees that the covenants set forth in this
                                         Section 5.14 are a material and substantial part of the transactions contemplated hereby
                                         and are supported by adequate consideration.(f) The Company agrees that it would be impossible
                                         or inadequate to measure and calculate the Buyer's damages from any breach of the covenants
                                         set forth in this Section 5.14. Accordingly, the Company agrees that if it or any of
                                         its Affiliates breaches any provision of this Section 5.14, the Buyer will have available,
                                         in addition to any other right or remedy otherwise available, the right to seek an injunction
                                         in accordance with Section 11.11.5.15 Financing.(a) No Amendment to Debt Commitment Letter.
                                         The Buyer shall, and shall cause the Buyer Designees to, not permit any amendment or
                                         modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, the
                                         Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver would (i) reduce the
                                         aggregate amount of the Debt Financing below the amount required to consummate the transactions
                                         contemplated hereby or (ii) impose new or additional conditions or other terms to the
                                         Debt Financing, or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt
                                         of the Debt Financing, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (A) delay, prevent

                                         employed in jurisdictions that recognize continuity of service, the Buyer shall recognize
                                         the continuous years of service of such Non- Automatic Transferred Employees so that
                                         for purposes of the Buyer's severance plans or applicable Laws, the transactions contemplated
                                         by this Agreement shall not constitute a severance of employment with respect to such
                                         Transferred Employees prior to or upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated
                                         by this Agreement.(i) With respect to Automatic Transferred Employees, the Buyer shall
                                         recognize and credit each Transferred Employee's paid time off, vacation or similar leave
                                         to the extent accrued but unused immediately prior to the Closing. With respect to Non-Automatic
                                         Transferred Employees, the Company shall take such action as is necessary to pay the

                                         applicable to such Company Restricted Stock Units and (ii) the value of each award of

                                         by concluding the applicable performance period as of the day immediately prior to the
                                         Closing Date and determining actual achievement of the performance measures applicable
                                         to such Company PSUs over the shortened performance period, the value of such Company
                                         Restricted Stock Units with respect to each Transferred Employee shall be replaced by
                                         the Buyer with Buyer equity incentive awards with equivalent value (based on the average

                                         with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (and
                                         any similar provision of state, local or foreign law, as appropriate) (the "Asset Level
                                         Allocation Statement") and together with the Entity Level Allocation Statement, the &ldquo;Allocation
                                         Statements&rdquo;). The Asset Level Allocation Statement shall be consistent in all respects

                                         to the Asset Level Allocation Statement. If any such disputes are not mutually agreed,
                                         any disagreements regarding the Asset Level Allocation Statement shall be submitted for

                                         the other hand; provided that if the Parties are unable to agree on a tax partner at
                                         a Neutral Accounting Firm to act as the Tax Arbitrator, each Party shall select a Neutral
                                         Accounting Firm and such firms together shall select a tax partner at another Neutral
                                         Accounting Firm to act as the Tax Arbitrator. The Tax Arbitrator shall only consider
                                         those items as to which Buyer and the Company have disagreed and must resolve the matter

                                         shall deliver to Buyer and the Company, as promptly as practicable and in any event within
                                         ninety (90) days after its appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution
                                         of any such disagreement determined in accordance with this Section 7.1. The Tax Arbitrator
                                         shall select as a resolution the position of either Buyer or the Company for each item
                                         of disagreement and may not impose an alternative resolution. The determination of the
                                         Tax Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon Buyer and77</FONT></P>

                                         of the California Revenue and Taxation Code section 6012(c)(10)). To the extent that

                                         prior to the expiration of the (30) Business Day period, (i) the Indemnifying Party will

                                         such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying

                                         the Indemnified Party but involves solely the payment of money damages for which the

                                         be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable
                                         to contracts executed and to be performed wholly within such state and without reference
                                         to the choice-of-law principles that would result in the application of the Laws of a
                                         different jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without limiting anything set
                                         forth in this Section 11.3, each Party agrees that any action, cause of action, claim,

                                         by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving
                                         effect to any choice of law or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State
                                         of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of

                                         court. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent that it may effectively
                                         do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action. The Parties

                                         herein to the contrary, without limiting anything set forth in Section 11.15, each of
                                         the Parties agrees (a) that any action of any kind or nature, whether at law or equity,
                                         in contract, in tort or otherwise, against a Debt Financing Source in connection with
                                         this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
                                         shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting

                                         Party submits for itself and its property with respect to any such action to the exclusive
                                         jurisdiction of such courts, (b) not to bring or permit any of its affiliates or representatives
                                         to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such action in any other court, (c) that
                                         a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
                                         jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law, (d) that
