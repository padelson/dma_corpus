<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Limited Guaranty (the "Limited Guaranty"), dated as of April&nbsp;13, 2008, is entered into by and among Greenfield Acquisition Partners V,&nbsp;L.P., a

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LIMITED GUARANTY.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To induce Seller to enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof
(as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "Merger Agreement"; capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger
Agreement), among Cobra Green&nbsp;LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Buyer"), Cobra Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer (the "Merger Sub"),
and Seller, the Guarantor absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Seller the due and punctual payment of (i)&nbsp;the Seller Termination Amount, if and when due pursuant to
Section&nbsp;8.3(a)(v) of the Merger Agreement, or (ii)&nbsp;any awards not to exceed $9,000,000 in the aggregate granted pursuant to a final, non-appealable judgment of a Delaware
Court (as defined below) for a claim based on fraud or intentional and material breach by Buyer under Section&nbsp;8.2 of the Merger Agreement (the "Obligation"). Seller hereby agrees that
(i)&nbsp;in no event shall the Guarantor be required to pay to any Person under, in respect of, or in connection with this Limited Guaranty more than the Seller Termination Amount (the "Cap
Amount"), and (ii)&nbsp;the Guarantor shall have no obligation or liability to any Person relating to, arising out of or in connection with, this Limited Guaranty other than as expressly set forth
herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Limited Guaranty, Seller hereby agrees that, to the extent the Buyer does not have any payment obligation under
Section&nbsp;8.3(a)(v) of the Merger Agreement, the Guarantor shall similarly not have any obligations under this Limited Guaranty. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NATURE OF LIMITED GUARANTY.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Limited Guaranty is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of
the full and punctual payment of the Obligation. This Limited Guaranty is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that Seller first attempt to collect the Obligation from Buyer or Merger Sub or
resort to any security or other means of collecting payment. Should Buyer or Merger Sub default in the payment of the Obligation, or otherwise are unable for any reason to pay the Obligation as and
when due, or if Seller is unable to bring a claim for the Obligation against Buyer or Merger Sub for any reason, the Guarantor's obligation hereunder shall become immediately due and payable to
Seller. If any payment in respect of the Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be
returned for any reason whatsoever, the Guarantor shall remain liable hereunder with respect to the Obligation up to the rescinded amount as if such payment had not been made. Seller hereby covenants
and agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause its affiliates not to institute, any proceeding or bring any other claim arising under, in connection with or resulting from, the Merger
Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, against the Guarantor or any Related Party (as defined below) except for claims against the Guarantor under this Limited Guaranty. Each party hereto
hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause its affiliates not to institute, any proceeding asserting that the Limited Guaranty is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in
accordance with its terms. </FONT></P>

time, without notice to or further consent of the Guarantor, extend the time of payment of the Obligation (provided that the foregoing shall be subject to the prior written consent of Buyer to the
extent such extension involves an amendment to the Merger Agreement), and may also make any agreement with Buyer or Merger Sub for the extension, renewal, payment, compromise, discharge or release
thereof, in whole or in part, or for any modification of the terms thereof or of any agreement between Seller on the one hand, and Buyer or Merger Sub, on the other hand, without in any way impairing
or affecting this Limited Guaranty. The Guarantor agrees that the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by
(a)&nbsp;the failure of Seller to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Buyer or Merger Sub; (b)&nbsp;any change in the time, place or manner of payment of the </FONT></P>

consent of Buyer to the extent it involves any amendment of the Merger Agreement); (c)&nbsp;the addition, substitution or release of any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement (provided that any such addition, substitution or release shall be subject to the prior written consent of Buyer to the extent it involves any amendment of the Merger Agreement);

other rights that the Guarantor may have at any time against Buyer, Merger Sub or Seller, whether in connection with the Obligation or otherwise; or (h)&nbsp;the adequacy of any other means Seller
may have of obtaining payment of the Obligation. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of any law that would
otherwise require any election of remedies by Seller. The Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of this Limited Guaranty and of the Obligation, presentment, demand for
payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of any Obligation incurred and all other notices of any kind, all defenses that may be available by virtue of any
valuation, stay, moratorium law or other similar law now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of Buyer or Merger Sub, and all suretyship defenses generally (other
than defenses to the payment of the Obligation that are available to Buyer or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement). The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct and indirect
benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Limited Guaranty are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. </FONT></P>

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NO SUBROGATION.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that
it may now have or hereafter acquire against Buyer or Merger Sub that arise from the existence, payment, performance, or enforcement of the Guarantor's obligations under or in respect of this Limited
Guaranty or any other agreement in connection therewith, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to
participate in any claim or remedy of Seller against Buyer or Merger Sub, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including, without
limitation, the right to take or receive from Buyer or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or security on account of
such claim, remedy or right, unless and until the Obligation shall have been indefeasibly paid in full in cash. If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding
sentence at any time prior to the indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Obligation, such amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of Seller, shall be segregated from other
property and funds of the Guarantor and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to Seller in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the
Obligation, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, whether matured or unmatured, or to be held as collateral for the Obligation. </FONT></P>

any right, remedy or power. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to
Seller or allowed it by law or other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by Seller at any time or from time to time. </FONT></P>
