AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November 23, 2011 (this
"Agreement"), is by and among CHS, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ("Parent"),
Science Merger Sub Ltd., an Israeli company and a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Solbar Industries Ltd., an Israeli company (the
"Company"). Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Section
8.10_.   

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and
in accordance with Sections 314-327 of the Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999
(the "Israeli Companies Law"), Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to
effect the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger"),
pursuant to which Merger Sub shall cease to exist, the Company shall become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to which Parent
assigns all of its shares of the Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time, and
the Company Ordinary Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration;   

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent and the Board of Directors and
shareholders of Merger Sub have each approved this Agreement, the Merger and
the other Transactions, on the terms and subject to the conditions in this
Agreement;   

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has approved and declared
advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders this
Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, on the terms and subject to
the conditions in this Agreement; and   

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has resolved to recommend that
the shareholders of the Company vote "For" approval of this Agreement and the
Merger at the Company Shareholder Meeting.   

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:   

ARTICLE I 
  _The Merger_     

SECTION 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the Israeli Companies Law, at
the Effective Time Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in
accordance with Section 323 of the Israeli Companies Law, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the Company
shall be the company surviving the Merger and become a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent (the "Surviving Company").   

SECTION 1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place as promptly as reasonably practicable (but no later than the fifth
business day) after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions at such time), at the offices of Naschitz, Brandes and Co., 5
Tuval Street, Tel Aviv, Israel, unless another time, date or place is agreed
to in writing by the parties hereto. The date of the Closing is referred to
in this Agreement as the "Closing Date."   

SECTION 1.3. _Effective Time_. Immediately following the Closing, Merger Sub
and the Company shall deliver to the Registrar of Companies of the State of
Israel (the "Companies Registrar") a notice informing the Companies Registrar
of the Merger and requesting the Companies Registrar to issue a certificate
evidencing the completion of the Merger in accordance with Section 323(5) of
the Israeli Companies Law (the "Certificate of Merger"). The parties hereto
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Certificate of
Merger on, or as soon as possible after, the Closing Date. The Merger shall
become effective upon the issuance and delivery by the Companies Registrar of
the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law. The
time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as
the "Effective Time."   

SECTION 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the Israeli Companies Law and this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, (a)
all properties, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, (b) all debts,
liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving Company and
(c) all properties, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of
the Surviving Company shall continue unaffected by the Merger in accordance
with the Israeli Companies Law.   

SECTION 1.5. _Articles of Association of the Surviving Company_. The articles
of association of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the articles of association of the Surviving
Company, until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable
Law.   

SECTION 1.6. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries_.   

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each member of the respective Boards
of Directors (or equivalent governing bodies) of the Companys Subsidiaries
(to the extent entitled to be appointed or removed by the Company) shall
resign or be removed and replaced with successors selected by Parent;
provided that Parent may request that any acting director of a Subsidiary
remain in office after the Effective Time to the extent and for the period
reasonably necessary for Company to designate replacement directors under
relevant Law and the parties shall then not take any action to cause the
removal or resignation of such director. Effective as of the Effective Time,
each member of the Board of Directors (or equivalent governing bodies) of the
Company shall resign or be removed and the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Company immediately following the Effective Time, until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed or their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of association of the
Surviving Company.   

(b) The parties hereto shall take all reasonable actions necessary so that
from and after the Effective Time, the individuals designated by Parent not
later than ten days prior to the Closing Date shall be the officers of the
Surviving Company, until their respective successors are duly appointed or
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles
of association of the Surviving Company.   

SECTION 1.7. _Approval Procedures_. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
Merger and the other Transactions will be consummated in accordance with
Section 314 through Section 327 of the Israeli Companies Law.   

ARTICLE II    

 _Effect of the Merger on Share Capital of Constituent Companies; Exchange of
Certificates; 
 Options_    

SECTION 2.1. _Effect on Share Capital_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of ordinary
shares, par value NIS 1 per share, of the Company ("Company Ordinary Shares")
or any share capital of Merger Sub:   

(a) _Share Capital of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable ordinary share of the Surviving Company and the shares of
the Surviving Company into which the shares of Merger Sub ordinary shares are
so converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving Company that
are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the shares of Merger
Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of ordinary
shares of the Surviving Company into which they were converted in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence.   

(b) _Treasury/Dormant Shares_. Any Company Ordinary Shares that are owned by
the Company or a Subsidiary thereof shall be cancelled and retired without
any conversion or consideration paid in respect thereof, and shall cease to
exist.   

(c) _Company Ordinary Shares_. Each issued and outstanding Company Ordinary
Share (other than those referenced in Section 2.1(b)) shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive
from Parent $4.00 in cash without interest per Company Ordinary Share (the
amount payable to a holder of Company Ordinary Shares as a result of
the Merger, the "Merger Consideration", and in the aggregate, the "Aggregate
Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, each holder of a
certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Company Ordinary Shares (each, a "Certificate"), and each owner of
any Book-Entry Company Shares, shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such Certificate or the Company Ordinary Shares formerly represented thereby
or to such Book-Entry Company Shares, as applicable, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_. If, at
any time after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Company for any reason, they shall be marked cancelled.   

SECTION 2.2. _Surrender and Payment Procedures_.   

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a bank
or trust company that maintains an office in Israel to act as paying agent
for the holders of Company Ordinary Shares in connection with the Merger (the
"Paying Agent"). The Paying Agent shall receive, and hold in trust for the
benefit of holders of Company Ordinary Shares, the Aggregate Merger
Consideration. Parent shall deposit the Aggregate Merger Consideration with
the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective Time. Pending its disbursement
to such holders, the Paying Agent shall invest the Merger Consideration
deposited with it as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company; _provided_ , that, (i) no such investment shall
relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article II_, and (ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could
prevent or delay payments to be made to the former Company shareholders
pursuant to this _Article II_. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or
income produced by, the Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying
Agent shall be payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise directs.   

(b) _Paying Agent Payment Procedures_. Parent and the Surviving Company shall
instruct the Paying Agent to, as promptly as reasonably practicable (but not
later than the second business day) after the Effective Time:   

(i) release to the Companys registration company (the "Registration
Company"), for the benefit of the beneficial owners of Company Ordinary
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
registered in the name of the Registration Company for the benefit of
TASE members ("Book Entry Company Shares"), cash in an amount equal to the
product of (A) the Merger Consideration payable per Company Ordinary Share,
_multiplied_ by (B) the number of Book Entry Company Shares (the product of
(A) and (B), the "Book-Entry Fund"). The Registration Company shall promptly
deliver the Book-Entry Fund to the TASE Clearinghouse, which shall deliver
the respective and appropriate portion of the Book-Entry Fund to each of the
beneficial owners of Book Entry Company Shares in accordance with applicable
customary stock surrender and payment procedures and regulations of TASE;
and   

(ii) mail to each holder of record of a Certificate, excluding any Certificate
representing Company Ordinary Shares held of record by the Registration
Company, a letter which shall specify instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration for the Company Ordinary Shares formerly represented thereby.
Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with such properly completed and validly executed documents as may
reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the surrendered Certificate shall
forthwith be cancelled in the Companys books and the surrendering holder
shall be promptly paid the Merger Consideration (less any required withholding
for Tax) for the Company Ordinary Shares formerly represented by such
Certificate. Notwithstanding the surrender and payment procedure described in
this _Section 2.2_, each Certificate shall be deemed at all times after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration for the Company Ordinary Shares formerly represented
thereby as contemplated by this  _Article II_.   

(c) _Shareholder Register_. The Merger Consideration paid in respect of
Company Ordinary Shares (whether in the form of Book Entry Company Shares or
represented by a Certificate) pursuant to this _Article II_ shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Company Ordinary Shares, and at the Effective Time, the shareholder register
of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the shareholder register of the Surviving
Company.   

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. The Paying Agent shall pay the
applicable Merger Consideration in exchange for any Company Ordinary Shares
formerly represented by a purportedly lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
subject to the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed delivering an affidavit of loss, in a form reasonably acceptable
to Parent, which affidavit shall set forth such claim and shall include an
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving
Company with respect to such Certificate. Any reference made in this
Agreement to a "Certificate" shall include an affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof that complies with the foregoing requirements.   

(e) _Termination of Payment Funds_. At any time following the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, the Surviving Company may require the Paying
Agent to deliver to it any funds (including the proceeds of any investments
with respect thereto) deposited with the Paying Agent which have not been
disbursed to the former holders of Company Ordinary Shares, and the
Surviving Company shall be entitled to require the Registration Company to
return any portion of the Book-Entry Fund not distributed to the beneficial
owners of the Book Entry Company Shares, and thereafter such former holders
shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Company (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof under
applicable law with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that
may be payable with respect to Company Ordinary Shares.   

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, nor the Surviving Company or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for any amount properly delivered to a
Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.   

(g) _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Registration Company,
the TASE members, the Paying Agent and the 102 Trustee shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable directly or
indirectly to any former holder of Company Ordinary Shares and/or Options
(as the case may be) pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts required to be
deducted and withheld from such payments under the Israeli Income Tax
Ordinance [New Version], 1961, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Ordinance"), or under any other applicable
state, local, domestic or foreign Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that at least
three (3) business days prior to any payment payable if a valid certificate
or ruling from the ITA, which provides a withholding tax exemption or a
reduced Tax rate, is provided to the Parent, the TASE member, the Surviving
Company, the Registration Company, the Paying Agent or the 102 Trustee, as
applicable, in form and substance acceptable thereto, as the case may be, the
deduction and withholding of any amounts under the Ordinance or any other
provision of Israeli law or requirement, if any, from the aggregate Merger
Consideration or Option Consideration, as the case may be, payable pursuant
to this Agreement shall be made in accordance with the provisions of such
ruling or certificate. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by or on behalf of Parent or
the Surviving Company (such as, by a TASE member, the Registration Company,
the Paying Agent or the 102 Trustee), Parent or the Surviving Company, as the
case may be, shall be treated as though it withheld an appropriate amount of
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former
holder of Company Ordinary Shares and/or Options (as the case may be) and
paid an appropriate amount to such Governmental Authority. Any amounts
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority shall be
treated for all purposes as having been paid directly to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.   

SECTION 2.3. _Options_.   

(a) _Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to provide that each option to acquire Company Ordinary
Shares (each, an "Option") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled, terminated and converted at the Effective
Time into the right to receive only the Option Consideration for each Company
Ordinary Share then subject to such Options. In each case, the Option
Consideration each holder of Options is entitled to receive for such Options
shall be rounded to the nearest cent and computed after aggregating the cash
amounts payable for all Options held by such holder. Upon the Effective Time,
all Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to
exist, and each holder of an Option shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the rights to receive any cash payments, as expressly
set forth herein. For purposes of the foregoing, the applicable exercise

SECTION 3.11. _Employee Benefits and Labor Matters_.   

(a) _Section 3.11(a)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
correct and complete list of each Company Plan, other than employment
agreements, and identifies whether such Company Plan applies to employees of
the Company or only a specific Subsidiary thereof.  _Section 3.11(a)(ii)_ of
the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of all

(b) Correct and complete copies of the following documents with respect to
each of the Company Plans have been delivered to Parent by the Company to the

summary plan descriptions, employee manuals and handbooks; (iii) any written
policies or procedures used in Company Plan administration; (iv) any service
agreements; (v) a summary of any dues the Company or its Subsidiaries pays to

(vii) any compliance or corrective filing made with an applicable regulatory
authority regarding a Company Plan for the past three years (including, but

(c) The Company Plans have been established and maintained in compliance in
all material respects with their terms and with the requirements prescribed
(whether as a matter of substantive law or as necessary to secure favorable
tax treatment) by all applicable provisions of the Ordinance and other Laws.
No event has occurred with respect to the operation of the Company Plans and
no circumstance exists that could cause the loss of such qualification or
exemption, or the imposition of any liability, penalty, Lien or Tax under the
Ordinance or any other applicable Laws.   

(d) The Company has not employed or retained any employees whose employment
would require special licenses, approvals or permits (such as foreign
employees). There are no unwritten Company policies which, by extension,
could entitle employees to benefits in addition to what they are entitled by
Law or Contract. Except as set forth on _Section 3.11(d)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no compensation increments or
components that are wrongly classified (or not accounted for) as such with
respect to applicable Tax Laws and are required to be reclassified as salary
components. The Company has properly implemented and has applied, as of
the commencement date of employment, all terms relating to the terms of its
employees employment in all material respects.   

(e) With respect to each Company Plan for which a separate fund of assets is
required to be maintained, full and timely payment has been made or, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, reserved in the Financial Statements in
accordance with IFRS of all amounts required of the Company, under the terms
of each such Company Plan or applicable Law (determined without regard to any
waiver of legally applicable funding requirements). Except as set forth on 
_Section 3.11(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the assets of
any Company Plan include any share capital or other securities issued by the
Company. To the extent any contribution or payment by the Company has accrued
but is not required under applicable Laws to be made with respect to any
Company Plan on or prior to June 30, 2011, such contribution or payment has
been reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet. All amounts due or accrued for all
salary, wages, bonuses, commissions, vacation and sick days have been
remitted and paid (or reserved for in the Companys books in accordance with
IFRS) in accordance with all applicable Laws and the material terms of any
applicable Company Plan, and no taxes, penalties or fees are owing under or in
respect of any Company Plan other than in the ordinary course. The Company
and its Subsidiaries have paid all outstanding material liabilities, fees,
expenses and obligations due and payable with respect to any Company Plan to
its employees, consultants, independent contractors, agents,
directors, officers and any other Person who provides or has provided
services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any
Company Plan.   

(f) With respect to each Company Plan and fiduciary or service provider
thereof: (i) no Action by or before any Governmental Authority is pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened and (ii) no other Action is
pending, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, by any participant
or beneficiary of any Company Plan, other than routine claims for benefits in
the ordinary course. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts that
could form a reasonable basis for any material Action with respect to any
Company Plan and fiduciary or service provider thereof. All amounts that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is legally or contractually required,
pursuant to Israeli Law, (A) to deduct from employees salaries, (B) to
transfer to employees pension arrangements, provident funds and Insurances,
(C) to withhold from employees salaries and benefits and (D) to pay to any
Governmental Authority as required by the Ordinance, the National Insurance
Law and the National Health Insurance Law of Israel or otherwise, have,
in each case, been duly deducted, transferred, withheld and paid, and neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any outstanding obligations to
make any such deduction, transfer, withholding or payment other than with
respect to those which have accrued but are not yet due and payable in the
ordinary course of business.   

(g) None of the Company Plans provide for post-employment welfare benefits for
any participant or beneficiary. The Company has complied with the notice and
continuation-coverage requirements of Code Section 4980B and the regulations
thereunder with respect to each Company Plan that is subject to ERISA and
also a group health plan (within the meaning of Code Section
5000(b)(1)).   

(h) Except as set forth on _Section 3.11(h)_ of the Company Disclosure

employee, director, sales agent, consultant, independent contractor or any
other Person, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable (or the number of
individuals entitled to benefits) under any Company Plan, (iii) accelerate
the time of payment, funding or vesting of any benefits under any Company
Plan, except as may be required by Law, (iv) require any contributions or
payments to fund any obligations under any Company Plan, or (v) limit the
right to merge, amend or terminate any Company Plan.

Subsidiaries operate. To the Knowledge of the Company and except as set forth

default under any Real Property Lease, and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
no event has occurred and no circumstance exists which, if not remedied, and
whether with or without notice or the passage of time or both, would result
in a material default by the Company, its applicable Subsidiary or
any counter-party thereunder. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
received or given any notice of any default or event that with notice or
lapse of time, or both, would constitute a material default by the Company or
any Subsidiary under any of the Real Property Leases and no party to any Real
Property Lease has exercised any termination rights (or indicated any intent
not to renew the leasehold term) with respect thereto. Except for Other

obtained all necessary Permits to own, lease, occupy, possess or use
the Company Properties (including building permits) and all of such Permits
are in full force and effect, except where the failure to obtain any such

Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in _Section 3.14(e)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding Actions (nor to the
Companys Knowledge are any Actions threatened) in connection with or arising
from the Companys or its Subsidiaries possession or use of any Company

sell, license, and otherwise use Company Intellectual Property and Company
Technology worldwide in connection with the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted. The Company Intellectual Property and
Company Technology includes all Intellectual Property and Technology used in
connection with the operation of the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted, and there is no other Intellectual
Property or Technology that is material to the operation of the businesses of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, except for shrink-

offer for sale, sale or use of the Company Intellectual Property and the
Company Technology, and the operation of the Companys and its Subsidiaries
businesses have not and do not, infringe, constitute an unauthorized use of
or misappropriate any Intellectual Property of any third Person. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or the subject of any
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened Action, which
involves a claim (i) against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, of
infringement, unauthorized use, or violation of any Intellectual Property or
Technology of any Person, or challenging the ownership, use, validity or
enforceability of any Company Intellectual Property or Company Technology or

Company or any of its Subsidiaries to use, distribute, sell, exercise, lease,

Company Technology, or any products, processes or materials covered thereby
in any manner. Except as set forth on _Section 3.15(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company has not received any notice of any such
threatened claim, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, are there any
facts or circumstances that reasonably could form the basis for any Claim
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, of infringement, unauthorized
use, or violation of any Intellectual Property or Technology of any Person,
or challenging the ownership, use, validity or enforceability of any Company
Intellectual Property or Company Technology. The Company Intellectual Property
and Company Technology owned or exclusively licensed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries are (i) valid, subsisting and enforceable, (ii) in compliance
with any and all formal legal requirements required to maintain the validity
and enforceability thereof, and (iii) not subject to any
outstanding judgment, injunction, order, decree, ruling or agreement
impairing, restricting or otherwise adversely affecting the Companys or any
of its Subsidiaries use or licensing thereof or rights thereto, or that
would impair the validity or enforceability thereof, except such that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any notification that a license under any other
Persons Intellectual Property is or may be required. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has made any offers of licenses to resolve any
alleged infringement of Company Intellectual Property or Company Technology
or charges of infringement under any Company Intellectual Property that have
been declined. Except as set forth in _Section 3.15(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries have sought

Subsidiary, has executed a valid and enforceable agreement with the Company
and/or one of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, as applicable, that (i) conveys

involved in the research, development, conception or reduction to practice of
any Company Intellectual Property or Company Technology have been paid in
full and no remuneration, compensation or other amounts remain outstanding or
may become due and payable under any circumstance. To the Knowledge of the

Subsidiaries from such Persons assignment of inventions pursuant to such
proprietary invention agreements. To the Knowledge of the Company, no current

its Subsidiaries who is or was involved in, or who has or will have
contributed to, the creation or development of any Company Intellectual
Property or Company Technology, in whole or in part, has performed services
for, or was an employee of, or was otherwise engaged by any third party
during or prior to the time of such Persons employment or engagement by the
Company or its applicable Subsidiaries, in a manner that may provide the
basis for any claim, interest, or right of such third party with respect to
any Company Intellectual Property or Company Technology.

to the businesses of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted and as contemplated to be conducted in the future has been

Property or Company Technology to the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to
enforceable, written and signed agreements, and no further consents,
assignments, waivers or other action is required for any employees,
contractors, consultants or other Persons Intellectual Property (or any
related rights) to be assigned to, transferred to, or otherwise fully vested
in the Company or its Subsidiaries (including obtaining any consents or
waivers from the employees, contractors or consultants) No employee,
contractor or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other
Person is in default or breach of any material term of any employment
agreement, non-disclosure agreement, assignment of invention agreement or
similar agreement relating to the protection, ownership, development, use or
transfer of Company Intellectual Property or Company Technology or, to the
Companys Knowledge, any other Intellectual Property or Technology.

Software, (b) requires the contribution, licensing, provision or public

(t) undertake or agree, in writing or otherwise, to take or omit to take any
of the foregoing actions.   

Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, the Company shall be entitled to
obtain renewal or tail insurance policies (collectively, the "Tail Policy"),
provided, that the term of any Tail Policy does not exceed seven years after
the Effective Time.   

SECTION 5.3. _No Solicitation by the Company; Etc_.   

(a) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date of termination of
this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the
Companys and its Subsidiaries respective directors, officers, employees,
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, agents and
other representatives (collectively as to any specified Person, its
"Representatives") to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any Takeover
Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit,
initiate, cause, facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries or proposals
that constitute any Takeover Proposal, (ii) solicit, encourage or participate
in any discussions or negotiations with any third party regarding any
Takeover Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement or understanding that
reasonably could result in any Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , that if prior
to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, after consultation with a
financial advisor of internationally recognized reputation and after
consultation with its outside counsel, the Board of Directors of the
Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover Proposal made
after the date hereof in circumstances not involving a breach of this
Agreement and the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in
good faith that (i) based upon the advice of its financial advisor,
such Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal and (ii) based upon the advice
of its outside legal counsel, the failure to take such action would violate
the Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under
the Israeli Companies Law, then the Company may, at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval and after providing Parent, at
least three (3) business days in advance, with written notice of its
intention to take such actions and of the identity of such third party in
addition to such other information required to be furnished by the Company
pursuant to Section 5.3(b) below ,furnish information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal;
_provided_ , that prior to providing any such information, the Person making
the Takeover Proposal and its applicable Representatives must enter into or
be bound by a customary confidentiality agreement with the Company
containing terms no less restrictive than the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement (as defined below) and a customary standstill provision, _provided_
that a copy of all such information is delivered simultaneously to Parent if
it has not previously been made available to Parent.   

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section 5.3_, the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than three
business days) after receipt of any proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact
regarding any Takeover Proposal, provide Parent a certificate from an
appropriate officer of the Company setting forth the identity of such
third party, the price (including the form of consideration and any holdback
or earnout components), structure and conditions of any such proposal, offer
or inquiry and indicating whether the offeror or inquiring party is a
strategic or financial buyer, and thereafter shall promptly keep
Parent informed of all material developments as they occur affecting the
status and terms of any such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests.   

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3(c)_, neither the Board
of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof (nor any Representative
of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof) shall (i)(A) withdraw or modify in
a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation or
the approval or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors of
this Agreement and the Transactions (including the Merger) or (B) approve or
recommend any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii)
approve or recommend or cause or authorize the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives to enter into, any letter
of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger,
acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or other agreement related
to any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in
accordance with _Section 5.3(a)_). Further, unless the Board of Directors
has made or is then considering a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
compliance with this Agreement, the Board of Directors shall, if requested by
Parent, promptly publicly reiterate the Company Board Recommendation (in a
press release, public filing, or other broadly disseminated communication)
after any Takeover Proposal becomes publicly disclosed, regardless of
the circumstances of disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of
Directors of the Company may withdraw or modify the Company Board
Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal that has not been
withdrawn, if such Board determines in good faith, after reviewing applicable
provisions of the Israeli Companies Laws and after consulting with and
receiving advice from its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make
such withdrawal or modification would constitute a breach by the Board of
Directors of the Company of its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders
under the Israeli Companies Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Company
Adverse Recommendation Change may be made in response to a purportedly
Superior Proposal until four business days following Parents receipt of
written notice from the Company (a "Company Adverse Recommendation Notice")
advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to make
such Company Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying all material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that
any subsequent material amendment to the financial terms or other material
terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Company
Adverse Recommendation Notice and a new three business day post-notice
period). Prior to effecting such a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to a purportedly Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the
Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to negotiate with Parent
in good faith to make such adjustments and amendments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such third party Takeover Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that, for avoidance of
doubt, if the economic terms of this Agreement, as so adjusted and
amended, are the same as or at least financially equivalent to the economic
terms in the third party Takeover Proposal (based on the value of the
consideration payable with respect to the Company Ordinary Shares as well as
the material conditions to the completion of the transaction), the Takeover
Proposal shall not be considered a Superior Proposal, and the Board of
Directors of the Company shall publicly reject such Takeover Proposal and
publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation.   

SECTION 5.4. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.   

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to use) their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper
or advisable to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly
as reasonably practicable and to consummate and make effective, the
Transactions, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notices, petitions,
statements, registrations, submissions of information, applications and other
documents (including any required or recommended filings under applicable
Antitrust Laws) and (ii) obtain all approvals, consents, registrations,
Permits, rulings, authorizations and other confirmations from any
Governmental Authority or other Person necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Transactions, including the Company Shareholder Approval, the
Required Regulatory Consents and the Other Approvals. Without limiting the
foregoing, (A) Parent agrees to refrain (and to cause Merger Sub to refrain)
from taking any action that reasonably would be expected to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, and (B) the Company agrees to refrain (and to
cause its Subsidiaries to refrain) from taking any action that reasonably
would be expected to prevent or materially delay or materially impair
the ability of the Company to consummate the Transactions.   

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, to the extent
required under applicable Law, (i) each party hereto agrees to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the RTPA
and/or any other applicable antitrust Law, with respect to the Merger as
promptly as reasonably practicable, to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to any applicable Law, and to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions
consistent with this _Section 5.4_ necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the RTPA or any other
applicable antitrust Law, as soon as reasonably practicable; and (ii) the
Company shall (x) take all action necessary to ensure that no takeover
statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the Transactions and
(y) if any takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the
Transactions, take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law
on the Transactions.   

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any
filing with or submission to any Governmental Authority in connection with
the Transactions and in connection with any Action by or before a
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, including any Action
initiated by a private party, and (ii) keep the other party informed in all
material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Israeli antitrust authority or any other applicable Governmental Authority and
of any material communication received or given in connection with any Action
by or involving any third party, in each case regarding any of the
Transactions. Subject to applicable Laws, the Company and its Subsidiaries
agree to consult with Parent in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by
such Governmental Authority, give Parent or its Representatives the
opportunity to attend and participate in any scheduled meeting or substantive
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Authority
in connection with the Transactions.   

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this  _Section 5.4_, each of the parties hereto shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the
Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of
this Agreement, the Company shall not, without Parents prior written
consent, commit to any divestiture transaction or agree to any restriction on
its or any of its Subsidiaries businesses, and nothing in this _Section
5.4_ shall (i) limit any applicable rights a party may have to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, (ii) require Parent or Merger Sub to
offer, accept or agree to (A) dispose of, license or hold separate (in trust
or otherwise) any part of its or the Companys (or the Surviving Company
after the Merger) or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
businesses, operations, assets or product lines (or any combination of
Parents and the Companys (or the Surviving Company after the Merger) or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates businesses, operations,
assets or product lines), (B) not compete in any geographic area or line of
business, (C) restrict or impose burdensome terms or conditions on the manner
in which, or whether, Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates may carry on business in any part
of the world (including, but not limited to, any such partys freedom of
action with respect to future acquisitions of assets or businesses or its
full rights of ownership with respect to any of its assets or businesses)
and/or (D) accept any undertaking or condition, enter into any consent
decree, accept any operational restriction, or take any other action that, in
the judgment of Parent, could be expected to limit the right of Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
to own or operate all or any portion of their respective businesses or assets
or (iii) require Parent to contest or otherwise resist any Action by, before
or involving any Governmental Authority or any private party, challenging any
of the Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Law (each of (i)-(iii) an
"Adverse Condition").   

SECTION 5.5. _Merger Proposal_.   

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement (but subject
to  _Section 5.1(b)_): (i) each of the Company and Merger Sub shall cause a
merger proposal substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit A_ (the
"Merger Proposal") to be executed in accordance with the Israeli Companies
Law; (ii) the Company shall call the Company Shareholder Meeting (it being
understood that the sole shareholder of Merger Sub has approved the Merger
and the Transaction prior to the execution of this Agreement), and (iii) the
Company and Merger Sub shall jointly deliver the Merger Proposal to the
Companies Registrar within three calendar days after the calling of the
Company Shareholder Meeting. Each of the Company and Merger Sub shall cause a
copy of its Merger Proposal to be delivered to its secured creditors, if any,
no later than three days after the date on which the Merger Proposal is
delivered to the Companies Registrar, and each shall promptly inform its
respective non-secured creditors, if any, of its Merger Proposal and its
contents in accordance with Section 318 of the Israeli Companies Law and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.   

(b) Promptly after the Company and Merger Sub comply with the preceding
paragraph and with  _subsections (i)_ and _(ii)_ below, but in any event no
more than three business days following the date on which such notice was
sent to the creditors, the Company and Merger Sub shall inform the Companies
Registrar, in accordance with Section 317(b) of the Israeli Companies
Law, that notice was given to their respective creditors under Section 318 of
the Israeli Companies Law and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In
addition to the foregoing, each of the Company and, if applicable, Merger
Sub, shall:   

(i) Publish a notice to their respective creditors, stating that a Merger
Proposal was submitted to the Companies Registrar and that the creditors may
review the Merger Proposal at the office of the Companies Registrar, the
Companys registered offices or Merger Subs registered offices, as
applicable, and at such other locations as the Company or Merger Sub, as
applicable, may determine, in (A) two daily Hebrew newspapers circulated in
Israel, on the day that the Merger Proposal is submitted to the Companies
Registrar, and (B) if required, at such other time and in such other manner
as may be required by applicable Laws and regulations; and   

(ii) Within four business days from the date of submitting the Merger Proposal
to the Companies Registrar, send a notice by registered mail to all of the
"Substantial Creditors" (as such term is defined in the regulations
promulgated under the Israeli Companies Law) that the Company or Merger Sub,
as applicable, are respectively aware of, stating that a Merger Proposal
was submitted to the Companies Registrar and that the creditors may review
the Merger Proposal at any additional locations determined as referred to in
the notice referenced in _subsection (i)_ above.   

SECTION 5.6. _Public Announcements_. Without limiting Parents review and
consultation rights in _Section 5.1(c)_, the initial press release with
respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to
be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company and issued at a mutually
agreed upon time promptly following the date hereof, which time shall
comply with the requirements of applicable Law. Thereafter, prior to the
Closing Date neither the Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement (to the extent
not previously issued or made in compliance with this Agreement) with respect
to the Merger, this Agreement or the other Transactions without the prior
written consent of the other party (in which case the party preparing any
such public announcement shall provide the other party with a draft of such
public announcement at least two days prior to the date for the
proposed release of such public announcement), except as may be required by
Law (including any ISA or Securities and Exchange Commission rules and
regulations) or by any applicable listing rules or agreement with TASE or
NASDAQ as determined in the good faith judgment of the party proposing
to make such release (in which case such party shall not issue or cause the
publication of such press release or other public announcement without prior
consultation with the other party, to the extent such prior consultation is
reasonably practicable and legally permissible). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company may make public statements in
response to specific questions regarding this Agreement or the Transactions
presented by the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long as such statements
are substantially similar to previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made by Parent or the Company in accordance with this
_Section 5.6_.   

SECTION 5.7. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, from the date of this Agreement
to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Parents Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours to all of the Companys and
its Subsidiaries properties (including real properties), books, Contracts,
commitments, records and correspondence, officers, directors, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives and the
Company shall promptly furnish to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule
and other document filed or submitted by it following the date hereof pursuant
to the requirements of applicable securities Laws or TASE requirements (and
the Company shall deliver to Parent a copy of each report, schedule and other
document proposed to be filed or submitted by the Company pursuant to the
requirements of applicable securities Laws or TASE requirements, to
the extent reasonably practicable and legally permissible, not less than two
business days prior to such filing) and a copy of any communication
(including "comment letters") received by the Company from the ISA or TASE,
or proposed to be sent by or on behalf of the Company to ISA or
TASE, concerning compliance with securities Laws or TASE listing
requirements, (ii) copies of all audited or unaudited financial statements
prepared after the date hereof through the Closing Date and (iii) all other
documents and information concerning the Companys and its Subsidiaries
business, properties and personnel as Parent or its Representatives may
reasonably request. Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the
Confidential Disclosure Agreement, dated as of July 2011, between Parent and
the Company (as amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality
Agreement"), Parent shall hold all information received from the Company
pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ in confidence in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.   

SECTION 5.8. _Notice of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice
to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) any
notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging
that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, (b) any Actions commenced or, to such partys
knowledge, threatened against, involving or otherwise affecting such party or
any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions, (c) the discovery
of any material fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any material event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which,
would cause any representation or warranty made by such party contained in
this Agreement to be untrue in any material respect, and (d) any material
failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.   

SECTION 5.9. _Directors  and Officers Insurance; Indemnification
Agreements_.   

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to fulfill and honor all the obligations of the Company pursuant to
the indemnification agreements listed on  _Section 5.9_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, with each individual who is a party to
such indemnification agreements and that at the Effective Time is, or at any
time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of the Company or
of any current or former Subsidiary of the Company (each, an "Indemnitee"
and, collectively, the "Indemnitees") which agreements shall survive the
Transactions and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the
Effective Time and until seven years from the Effective Time, shall cause,
unless otherwise required by Law, the articles of association, certificate of
incorporation and by-laws (as applicable) and comparable
organizational documents of the Surviving Company and each of its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with
respect to exculpation and limitation of liabilities of directors and
officers, insurance and indemnification than are set forth as of the date of
this Agreement in the Company Charter Documents and the Subsidiary Documents,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees
with respect to exculpation and limitation of liabilities or insurance
and indemnification.   

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to maintain in effect
any Tail Policy (as referred to in _Section 5.2_) and continue to honor all
obligations pursuant to such Tail Policy.   

(c) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.9_ applies are intended third
party beneficiaries of this Section 5.9ý. The provisions of this _Section
5.9_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee, his or her
successors, heirs or representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by
any Indemnitee in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in
this _Section 5.9_.   

(d) This _Section 5.9_ shall be binding upon Parent and the Surviving Company
and their respective successors and assigns. In the event that Parent or the
Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as applicable,
shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this ý _Section 5.9_.   

SECTION 5.10. _Merger Sub Obligations_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
comply with all of its obligations under this Agreement. During the period
from the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, except as
expressly provided in this Agreement, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall
not permit Merger Sub to, conduct any business or undertake any activities
except as required to perform its express obligations hereunder.   

SECTION 5.11. _Employee Matters_.   

(a) During the six-month period commencing on the Closing Date, Parent shall
provide or shall cause the Surviving Company to provide to continuing
employees of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries ("Company Employees")
compensation and benefits that are, in the aggregate, to any such employee,
no less favorable than the compensation and benefits being provided to such
Company Employee as of the date hereof under his/her employment agreement and
the Company Plans as set forth in _Section 3.11(a)(i)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule; _provided, however_ , that nothing herein shall be
construed as limiting the right or ability of the Surviving Company
and/or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, to terminate the employment of a
continuing employee for Cause, or as creating any obligation of the Parent or
the Surviving Company or a Subsidiary thereof with respect to the
compensation or employment of such an employee.   

(b) Without limiting _Section 5.12ý(a)_, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Company to honor, fulfill and discharge, the Companys and its
Subsidiaries obligations under any Company Plans as set forth _in Section
3.11(a)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and employment agreements in
effect as of the date hereof.   

(c) For purposes of eligibility under any employee benefit plans of Parent
that will provide benefits to any Company Employee after the Closing (the
"New Plans"), and for purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid time off
and any severance benefits under the New Plans, each Company Employee shall
be credited with his or her years of service with the Company or its
applicable Subsidiaries to the same extent as such Company Employee was
entitled before the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar
Company Plan. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing (but subject to any limitations under applicable Laws or the terms
of the applicable Company Plan): (i) each Company Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under
a comparable Company Plan in which such Company Employee was eligible to and
did participate immediately before the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of
each such New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or
her covered dependents, and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her
covered dependents under a Company Plan during the portion of the plan year
of the New Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents
for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance
with such New Plan.   

SECTION 5.12. _Israeli Approvals_.   

(a) _Government Filings; Other Approvals_. Each party to this Agreement shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to prepare, deliver and file, as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, each notice, report
or other document required to be delivered by such party to, or filed by such
party with, any Israeli Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger.
The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, make or
give (in the case of filing or notice only Other Approvals), as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, all of the Required Regulatory
Consents and Other Approvals and any other consents and approvals that may be
required in connection with the Merger. Parent shall provide to
the Investment Center and all other applicable authorities any information,
and shall execute any undertakings, in each case reasonably requested by such
authorities as a condition to obtaining the Required Regulatory
Consents.   

(b) _Legal Proceedings_ _._ The Company and Parent each shall: (i) give the
other party prompt notice of the commencement of any Action by or before any
Israeli Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement or the Merger;
(ii) keep the other party informed as to the status of any such Action; and
(iii) promptly inform the other party of any communication to or from
the Commissioner of Israeli Restrictive Trade Practices, the Investment
Center, the ISA, the ITA, the Israel Land Authority, the Israeli Ministry of
Industry, Trade and Labor, the Companies Registrar or any other Israeli
Governmental Authority regarding this Agreement or the Merger. The Company
and Parent will consult and cooperate with one another, and will consider in
good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted in connection with any Israeli legal proceeding relating to
this Agreement or the Merger, pursuant to a joint defense agreement to the
extent necessary or advisable to preserve legal privilege. In addition,
except as may be prohibited by any Israeli Governmental Authority or by any
Israeli Law, in connection with any such Action under or relating to the
RTPA, the Company and Parent will each permit authorized Representatives of
the other party to be present at each meeting or conference relating to any
such legal proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection
with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Israeli
Governmental Authority in connection with any such legal proceeding.   

(c) _Israeli Tax Rulings_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Company shall instruct its Israeli counsel,
advisors and accountants to prepare and file with the ITA an application for
a ruling (which shall be provided to Parent for review and approval prior to
its submission, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) (i)
confirming that the treatment of any Options subject to Section 102 of the
Ordinance in accordance with  _Section 2.3_ shall not be regarded as a
violation of the requisite holding period, if the applicable Option
Consideration is deposited with the 102 Trustee of such Options until the end
of the respective holding period (which ruling may be subject to customary
conditions regularly associated with such a ruling), and (ii) requesting to
exempt the non-Israeli Personnel and consultants of the Company and its
Affiliates from Israeli Tax, and to exempt the Company (and the Surviving
Company after the Merger), its applicable Affiliates, Parent, Merger Sub, the
102 Trustee and the Paying Agent from any withholding obligation with respect
to payments made pursuant to the Merger with respect to Options (the "Options
Tax Ruling"). Parent will apply to the ITA to seek a pre-ruling exempting
Parent and the Surviving Company from any obligation to withhold Israeli
Tax from any consideration deposited with or payable by the Paying Agent, the
102 Trustee, the Surviving Company or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement or clarifying that no such obligation exists (the "Withholding Tax
Ruling"). In the alternative, the Company shall, if requested by Parent,
submit or include in the request for the Options Tax Ruling a request for
the Withholding Tax Ruling. Each of the Company and Parent shall cause their
respective Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants to coordinate all
activities, and to cooperate with each other, with respect to the preparation
and filing of such application and in the preparation of any written or oral
submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable in support of the
request for the Options Tax Ruling and the Withholding Tax Ruling. Subject to
the terms and conditions hereof, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all action and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws to cause or facilitate obtaining the Options Tax Ruling
and the Withholding Tax Ruling, as promptly as practicable. Neither the
Company nor any of its Representatives shall make any application to, or
conduct any negotiation with, the ITA with respect to any matter relating
to the subject matter of the Option Tax Ruling in coordination with Parent
and its representatives, and the Company will enable Parents representatives
to participate in all discussions and meetings relating thereto to the extent
practical and upon reasonable notice. To the extent that
Parents representatives elect not to participate in any meeting or
discussion, the Companys representatives shall provide Parent with a prompt
and full report of the discussions held. In any event, the final text of the
request for the Option Tax Ruling shall be subject to the prior written
consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.   

SECTION 5.13. _Transaction Expenses._ At least five business days prior to the
Closing, Company shall submit documentation (the "Payoff Instructions")
setting forth the amount of all Transaction Expenses of the Company,
including the identity of each recipient, the amounts previously paid and any
additional amounts payable through or as a result of the Closing.
Together with the delivery of the Payoff Instructions, the Company shall
deliver to Parent receipts and releases evidencing payment (or the final
amount, if to be paid at Closing) of the Transaction Expenses. At or prior to
the Closing, the Company shall pay to the designated recipients in accordance
with the Payoff Instructions any unpaid Transaction Expenses which are
required to be paid by Company at or as a result of Closing.   

SECTION 5.14. _Non-Solicitation of Employees, Consultants and Advisors_. Until
the earlier of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) two years after the date of
this Agreement, Parent agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly
through its Representatives, solicit any person engaged as an employee,
consultant or advisor of the Company or its Subsidiaries to alter
its relationship with the Company or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_
, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to general solicitations of
employment by or on behalf of the Parent that are not specifically directed
at the employees, consultants or advisors of the Company or its
Subsidiaries.   

ARTICLE VI    

 _Conditions Precedent_     

SECTION 6.1. _Conditions to Each Party s Obligation to Effect the Merger_.
The respective obligations of each party hereto to effect the Merger shall be
subject to the satisfaction (or waiver, if permissible under applicable Law)
