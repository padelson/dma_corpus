<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November&nbsp;23, 2011 (this &#147;<B>Agreement</B>&#148;), is by and
among CHS, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (&#147;<B>Parent</B>&#148;), Science Merger Sub Ltd., an Israeli company
and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (&#147;<B>Merger Sub</B>&#148;), and Solbar Industries Ltd., an Israeli
company (the &#147;<B>Company</B>&#148;). Certain terms used in this Agreement are defined in <U>Section&nbsp;8.10</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance
with Sections&nbsp;314-327 of the Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999 (the &#147;<B>Israeli Companies Law</B>&#148;),
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company (the &#147;<B>Merger</B>&#148;), pursuant to which Merger Sub shall cease to exist, the Company shall become
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent to which Parent assigns all of its
shares of the Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time, and the Company Ordinary Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent and the Board of Directors and shareholders of
Merger Sub have each approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions, on the terms
and subject to the conditions in this Agreement;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has approved and declared advisable and in the
best interests of the Company and its shareholders this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions, on the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has resolved to recommend that the shareholders
of the Company vote &#147;For&#148; approval of this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Shareholder
Meeting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company hereby agree as follows:

<U><B>The Merger</B></U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 1.1. <U>The Merger</U>. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the Israeli Companies Law, at the Effective Time Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with Section&nbsp;323 of the Israeli
Companies Law, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, and the
Company shall be the company surviving the Merger and become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
(the &#147;<B>Surviving Company</B>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 1.2. <U>Closing</U>. The closing of the Merger (the &#147;<B>Closing</B>&#148;) shall take place as
promptly as reasonably practicable (but no later than the fifth business day) after satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in <U>Article&nbsp;VI</U> (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions at such time), at the offices of Naschitz, Brandes & Co., 5 Tuval Street, Tel Aviv,
Israel, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The date
of the Closing is referred to in this Agreement as the &#147;<B>Closing Date</B>.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 1.3. <U>Effective Time</U>. Immediately following the Closing, Merger Sub and the
Company shall deliver to the Registrar of Companies of the State of Israel (the &#147;<B>Companies
Registrar</B>&#148;) a notice informing the Companies Registrar of the Merger and requesting the Companies
Registrar to issue a certificate evidencing the completion of the Merger in accordance with
Section&nbsp;323(5) of the Israeli Companies Law (the &#147;<B>Certificate of Merger</B>&#148;). The parties hereto shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Certificate of Merger on, or as soon as
possible after, the Closing Date. The Merger shall become effective upon the issuance and delivery
by the Companies Registrar of the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the Israeli Companies
Law. The time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the
&#147;<B>Effective Time</B>.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">SECTION 1.4. <U>Effects of the Merger</U>. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the Israeli Companies Law and this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, (a)&nbsp;all properties, rights, privileges, immunities,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, (b)&nbsp;all
debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities, obligations and duties of the Surviving Company and (c)&nbsp;all properties, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Surviving Company shall continue unaffected by
the Merger in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law.

company that maintains an office in Israel to act as paying agent for the holders of Company
Ordinary Shares in connection with the Merger (the &#147;<B>Paying Agent</B>&#148;). The Paying Agent shall
receive, and hold in trust for the benefit of holders of Company Ordinary Shares, the Aggregate
Merger Consideration. Parent shall deposit the Aggregate Merger Consideration with the Paying
Agent at or prior to the Effective Time. Pending its disbursement to such holders, the Paying
Agent shall invest the Merger Consideration deposited with it as directed by Parent or, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Company; <U>provided</U>, that, (i)&nbsp;no such investment shall relieve
Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this <U>Article&nbsp;II</U>, and
(ii)&nbsp;no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made to
the former Company shareholders pursuant to this <U>Article&nbsp;II</U>. Any net profit resulting
from, or interest or income produced by, the Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent
shall be payable to Parent or as Parent otherwise directs.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Paying Agent Payment Procedures</U>. Parent and the Surviving Company shall instruct

members (&#147;<B>Book Entry Company Shares</B>&#148;), cash in an amount equal to the product of (A)&nbsp;the Merger
Consideration payable per Company Ordinary Share, <U>multiplied</U> by (B)&nbsp;the number of Book
Entry Company Shares (the product of (A)&nbsp;and (B), the &#147;<B>Book-Entry Fund</B>&#148;). The Registration Company

respective and appropriate portion of the Book-Entry Fund to each of the beneficial owners of Book
Entry Company Shares in accordance with applicable customary stock surrender and payment procedures
and regulations of TASE; and

surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such properly
completed and validly executed documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the
surrendered Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled in the Company&#146;s books and the surrendering
holder shall be promptly paid the Merger Consideration (less any required withholding for Tax) for
the Company Ordinary Shares formerly represented by such Certificate. Notwithstanding the
surrender and payment procedure described in this <U>Section&nbsp;2.2</U>, each Certificate shall be
deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration for the Company Ordinary Shares formerly represented thereby as contemplated by this
<U>Article&nbsp;II</U>.

Ordinary Shares (whether in the form of Book Entry Company Shares or represented by a Certificate)
pursuant to this <U>Article&nbsp;II</U> shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Ordinary Shares, and at the Effective Time, the shareholder
register of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the shareholder register of the Surviving Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates</U>. The Paying Agent shall pay the applicable
Merger Consideration in exchange for any Company Ordinary Shares formerly represented by a
purportedly lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, subject to the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed delivering an affidavit of loss, in a form reasonably acceptable to
Parent, which affidavit shall set forth such claim and shall include an indemnity against any claim

which have not been disbursed to the former holders of Company Ordinary Shares, and the Surviving
Company shall be entitled to require the Registration Company to return any portion of the
Book-Entry Fund not distributed to the beneficial owners of the Book Entry Company Shares, and
thereafter such former holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Company (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof under applicable
law with respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable with respect to
Company Ordinary Shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;<U>No Liability</U>. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
none of the parties hereto, nor the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any
Person for any amount properly delivered to a Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(g)&nbsp;<U>Withholding Taxes</U>. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
each of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Registration Company, the TASE members, the Paying Agent
and the 102 Trustee shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable directly or indirectly to any former holder of Company Ordinary Shares and/or Options (as
the case may be) pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts required to be deducted and withheld from
such payments under the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance &#091;New Version&#093;, 1961, as amended, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder (the &#147;<B>Ordinance</B>&#148;), or under any other applicable state,
local, domestic or foreign Law; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that at least three (3)&nbsp;business
days prior to any payment payable if a valid certificate or ruling from the ITA, which provides a
withholding tax exemption or a reduced Tax rate, is provided to the Parent, the TASE member, the
Surviving Company, the Registration Company, the Paying Agent or the 102 Trustee, as applicable, in
form and substance acceptable thereto, as the case may be, the deduction and withholding of any
amounts under the Ordinance or any other provision of Israeli law or requirement, if any, from the
aggregate Merger Consideration or Option Consideration, as the case may be, payable pursuant to
this Agreement shall be made in accordance with the provisions of such ruling or certificate. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority by
or on behalf of Parent or the Surviving Company (such as, by a TASE member, the Registration
Company, the Paying Agent or the 102 Trustee), Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may be,
shall be treated as though it withheld an appropriate amount of consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of Company Ordinary Shares and/or Options (as the
case may be) and paid an appropriate amount to such Governmental Authority. Any amounts so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority shall be treated for all purposes
as having been paid directly to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Options</U>. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to provide that each option to acquire Company Ordinary Shares (each, an &#147;<B>Option</B>&#148;) issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled, terminated and
converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive only the Option Consideration for each
Company Ordinary Share then subject to such Options. In each case, the Option Consideration each
holder of Options is entitled to receive for such Options shall be rounded to the nearest cent and
computed after aggregating the cash amounts payable for all Options held by such holder. Upon the
Effective Time, all Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist,
and each holder of an Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights
to receive any cash payments, as expressly set forth herein. For purposes of the foregoing, the
applicable exercise price of each Option shall be calculated in U.S. Dollars in accordance with the

cooperation with the Company, the aggregate Option Consideration that holders of Options are

such deposit, Parent may elect to pay such Option Consideration directly to such holders through
the Surviving Company&#146;s or its applicable Subsidiaries&#146; ordinary payroll mechanisms or through some
other payment procedure, unless such payment mechanism will result in the loss of a Tax benefit
otherwise available to the applicable Option holder or is prohibited by the terms of the applicable
Company Share Plan or applicable Law. All payments with respect to Options, as set forth on
<U>Section&nbsp;3.2(a)</U> of the Company Disclosure Schedule&nbsp;(the &#147;<B>Option Schedule</B>&#148;), shall be

Shareholder Approval, after consultation with a financial advisor of internationally recognized
reputation and after consultation with its outside counsel, the Board of Directors of the Company
receives an unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof in

business days in advance, with written notice of its intention to take such actions and of the

any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)&nbsp;being referred to as a &#147;<B>Company

may withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal that has
not been withdrawn, if such Board determines in good faith, after reviewing applicable provisions
of the Israeli Companies Laws and after consulting with and receiving advice from its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make such withdrawal or modification would constitute a breach by the
Board of Directors of the Company of its fiduciary duties to the Company&#146;s shareholders under the
Israeli Companies Law; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that no Company Adverse Recommendation
Change may be made in response to a purportedly Superior Proposal until four business days

Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying all material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any subsequent material amendment to the financial
terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Company Adverse
Recommendation Notice and a new three business day post-notice period). Prior to effecting such a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a purportedly Superior Proposal, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to negotiate with Parent in
good faith to make such adjustments and amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so
that such third party Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; <U>provided</U>,

are the same as or at least financially equivalent to the economic terms in the third party
Takeover Proposal (based on the value of the consideration payable with respect to the Company
Ordinary Shares as well as the material conditions to the completion of the transaction), the
Takeover Proposal shall not be considered a Superior Proposal, and the Board of Directors of the
Company shall publicly reject such Takeover Proposal and publicly reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation.

enforced in or by such court.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(c)&nbsp;Each party recognizes and acknowledges that a breach of its covenants and obligations in

terms of this Agreement, and to seek and obtain an injunction or other equitable remedy as a remedy
for (or to prevent) any breach of this Agreement. Each party further agrees that the parties shall
