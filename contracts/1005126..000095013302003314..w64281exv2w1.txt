OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of
September 30, 2002, by and among, CITIZENS BANK OF PENNSYLVANIA, a
Pennsylvania chartered savings bank ("Buyer"), COMMONWEALTH BANCORP, INC., a
Pennsylvania corporation ("Seller"), and for the purpose of Article III and
Section 6.15, CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation and the
parent company of the Buyer ("Parent"). The capitalized terms used in this
Agreement are defined in Section 9.14 hereof.   WHEREAS, the Board of
Trustees of the Buyer and the Board of Directors of the Seller have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective stockholders
and other constituencies, as well as the communities they serve, to
consummate, and have approved, the business combination transactions provided
for herein, in which the Buyer will, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, acquire the Seller;   WHEREAS, following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Buyer shall take such action as is
appropriate to form a subsidiary to be organized as a corporation (the
"Merger Sub") under the PBCL, and to cause the Merger Sub to become a party
to this Agreement, pursuant to which the Merger Sub shall merge (the
"Merger") with and into the Seller, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein (the Seller and the Merger Sub being
the constituent corporations of the Merger);   WHEREAS, following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, Buyer (sometimes referred to herein
as the "Surviving Bank"), shall enter into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
(the "Bank Merger Agreement") with Commonwealth Bank, a Pennsylvania
chartered savings bank and subsidiary of the Seller (the "Seller Bank"),
substantially in the form of Exhibit I hereto, providing for the merger of
the Seller Bank with and into the Buyer (the "Bank Merger") under
the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as amended, promptly following
the consummation of the Merger; and   WHEREAS, the parties desire to make
certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the
Merger and to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger;   NOW, THEREFORE,
in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and
agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I - THE MERGER   1.1 THE MERGER.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the
PBCL, at the Effective Time, the Merger Sub shall merge with and into the
Seller. The Seller shall be the surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes
called the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger, and shall continue its
corporate existence under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a
subsidiary of the Buyer. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the Merger Sub shall terminate.       1.2
EFFECTIVE TIME. The Merger shall become effective when Articles of Merger
("Articles of Merger"), executed in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the PBCL, are filed with the Pennsylvania Secretary; provided, however,
that upon the mutual written consent of each of the Buyer and the Seller, the
Articles of Merger may provide for a later time or date of effectiveness of
the Merger not more than thirty (30) days after the date the Articles of
Merger are filed with the Pennsylvania Secretary. When used in
this Agreement, the term "Effective Time" shall mean the date and time at
which the Articles of Merger are filed with the Pennsylvania Secretary or
such later time established by the Articles of Merger. The filing of the
Articles of Merger with the Pennsylvania Secretary shall be made on the
Closing Date.   1.3 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. At and after the Effective Time,
the Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in Section
1929 of the PBCL.   1.4 CONVERSION OF SELLER COMMON STOCK. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Merger Sub, the Seller or the holder of any of the shares of the Seller
Common Stock:   (a) Each share of the common stock, par value $0.10
per share, of the Seller ("Seller Common Stock") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, "Shares") (other than
Shares held (i) in the Seller\'s treasury or (ii) directly or indirectly by
the Buyer or the Seller or any of their respective subsidiaries (except for
Trust Account Shares or DPC Shares)) shall become and be converted
automatically into the right to receive in cash from the Buyer an amount
equal to $46.50 ("Merger Consideration").   (b) All of the Shares converted
into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, a "Certificate")
previously representing any such Shares shall thereafter represent the right
to receive the Merger Consideration. Certificates previously representing
Shares shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of
such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof, without any interest
thereon.   (c) At the Effective Time, all Shares that are owned by
the Seller as treasury stock, all shares that are held in trust under the
Seller Restricted Share Plans that have not been allocated to any
individual participant, and all Shares that are owned directly or indirectly
by the Buyer or the Seller or any of their respective subsidiaries (other
than Shares held directly or indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts
and the like or otherwise held in a fiduciary capacity that are beneficially
owned by third parties (any such Shares, whether held directly or indirectly
by the Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, being referred to herein as
"Trust Account Shares") and other than any Shares held by the Buyer or the
Seller or any of their respective subsidiaries in respect of a debt
previously contracted (any such Shares, whether held directly or indirectly
by the Buyer or the Seller or any of their respective subsidiaries,
being     (2)   referred to herein as "DPC Shares")) shall be canceled
and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.   1.5 MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK. At and after the Effective Time,
each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become
and be converted automatically into one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.   1.6 EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS; RESTRICTED SHARES. (a)
Prior to and effective as of the Effective Time, the Seller shall take all
such action as is necessary to terminate, subject to compliance with this
Section 1.6, the Seller 1993 Amended Stock Incentive Plan, the Seller 1993
Amended Directors\' Stock Option Plan, the Seller 1996 Amended Stock Option
Plan and the Seller 2000 Incentive Stock Option Plan (collectively, the
"Seller Stock Option Plans"), and shall provide written notice to each holder
of a then outstanding stock option to purchase shares of Seller Common Stock
pursuant to the Seller Stock Option Plans (whether or not such stock option
is then vested or exercisable), that such stock option shall be, as at the
date of such notice, exercisable in full and that such stock option shall
terminate at the Effective Time and that, if such stock option is not
exercised or otherwise terminated on or before the Effective Time, such
holder shall be entitled to receive in cancellation of such option a cash
payment from the Seller at the Closing in an amount equal to the excess of
the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price of such stock
option, multiplied by the number of shares of Seller Common Stock covered by
such stock option, subject to any required withholding of taxes. The
Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the written
acknowledgement of each holder of a then-outstanding stock option to purchase
shares of Seller Common Stock pursuant to the Seller Stock Option Plans with
regard to the cancellation of such stock option and the payment therefor in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, the
Seller Stock Option Plans and all options issued thereunder shall terminate
at the Effective Time. The Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Buyer
that the maximum number of shares of Seller Common Stock subject to issuance
pursuant to the exercise of stock options issued and outstanding under the
Seller Stock Option Plans is not and shall not be at or prior to the
Effective Time more than 1,516,786.   (b) At the Effective Time, each
unvested restricted share of Seller Common Stock (collectively, the "Seller

Recognition Plan for Officers, 1993 Amended Management Recognition Plan for
Directors and 1996 Amended Recognition and Retention Plan (collectively, the
"Seller Restricted Share Plans") which is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall vest and become free of any restrictions to which
they are subject under the Seller Restricted Share Plans. Each holder of a
Seller Restricted Share shall have the same rights to receive the Merger
Consideration as are provided to other holders of shares of Seller Common
Stock pursuant to Section 1.4 and Article II hereof.     (3)    1.7
ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION. Unless otherwise provided by the Buyer, at the
Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the Seller, as in effect at
the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance
with applicable law.   1.8 BY-LAWS. At the Effective Time, the By-Laws of
the Seller, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and such By-Laws.   1.9 DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation, and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in
each case until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified.   ARTICLE II - EXCHANGE OF SHARES   2.1 BUYER TO DEPOSIT
AGGREGATE MERGER CONSIDERATION. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer
shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to a bank or trust company selected by
the Buyer and reasonably acceptable to the Seller (which may be a subsidiary
or other Affiliate of the Buyer) (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of
the holders of Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II,
such amount of cash as is sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration which holders of Shares are entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 1.4 hereof.   2.2 EXCHANGE OF SHARES.   (a) As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, and in no event later than three (3) business days
thereafter, the Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate or Certificates a form letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which each
share of Seller Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Certificates
shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Upon proper surrender
of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange for
each share represented thereby, the Merger Consideration, and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be
paid on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of any
Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If payment of
the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in
whose name the     (4)   surrendered Certificate is registered on the
stock transfer books of the Seller, it shall be a condition of payment that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall
have paid all transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such taxes either have been paid or are not
applicable.   (b) At any time following the expiration of the sixth
(6th) month after the Effective Time, the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds
which had been made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to
holders of Shares (including, without limitation, all interest and other
income received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available
to it), and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to the Buyer
and the Surviving Corporation (subject to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to
any Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held
by them.   (c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Seller of the shares of Seller Common Stock which
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Seller Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided herein or
by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing
such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Article II.   (d) Neither the Buyer nor the Seller nor any other
Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any shares or any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto or any Merger Consideration
delivered in respect of any such Shares properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.   (e) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon receipt of appropriate evidence as to such loss, theft or
destruction and to the ownership of such Certificate by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and the receipt by
the Buyer of appropriate and customary indemnification, the Buyer will issue
in exchange for each Share represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration, as determined in accordance with this
Article II.   ARTICLE III - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BUYER

Adverse Effect.   3.2 AUTHORITY; NO VIOLATION. (a) Each of the Parent and
the Buyer has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a
party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been
duly and validly approved by each of the Board of Trustees of the Buyer and
the Board of Directors of the Parent, as applicable. Except for the adoption

consummate the Merger. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to
which the Buyer or the Parent, as applicable, is a party have been duly and
validly executed and delivered by each of the Parent and the Buyer, as
applicable, and (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
Seller and the Seller Bank), constitute the valid and binding obligation of
the Parent and the Buyer, as applicable, enforceable against each of them in
accordance with their respective terms. The Parent, acting in its capacity as
the sole stockholder of the Buyer, shall approve the Bank Merger Agreement
prior to the Effective Time.   (b) Neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents to which the Buyer or the
Parent, as applicable, is a party by the Parent and the Buyer, as applicable,

the consents and approvals referred to in Section 3.3 hereof are duly
obtained, violate in any respect any statute, code, ordinance, rule,
regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or injunction applicable to the
Parent or the Buyer, or (ii) violate, conflict with, or result in a breach
of, any provisions of, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice
or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, result in the

properties or assets of the Parent or the Buyer under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of (y) the Articles of Incorporation or other
charter document of like nature or By-Laws of the Parent or the Buyer, or (z)

or other instrument or obligation to which the Parent or the Buyer is a party
as issuer, guarantor or obligor, or by which it or any of its properties or
assets may be bound or affected, except, in the case of clause (ii)(z) above,
for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults which either
individually or in the aggregate will not have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Parent or the Buyer.   3.3 CONSENTS AND APPROVALS. Except for consents,

knowledge of the Buyer, threatened, against the Buyer or any subsidiary or
other Affiliate of the Buyer or challenging the validity or propriety of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and which, if adversely
determined, would, individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely
affect the Buyer\'s ability to perform its respective obligations under this
Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement, nor is there any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any legal or administrative body or arbitrator
outstanding against the Buyer or any subsidiary or other Affiliate of the
Buyer having, or which insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, in the future
could have, any such effect.   3.7 CAPITAL; AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS. On the
date hereof, the Buyer is, and on the Closing Date, the Buyer will be,
"adequately capitalized" as such term is defined in the rules and regulations
promulgated by the FDIC, and on the date hereof, the Parent is, and on the

sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and to pay any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement and to effect the transactions
contemplated hereby.   3.8 BUYER INFORMATION. The information relating to
the Parent, Buyer, their respective subsidiaries and other Affiliates to be
contained in the proxy statement filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act
(the "Seller Proxy Statement"), as described in Section 6.1 hereof, and any
other documents filed with the SEC in connection herewith, to the extent such
information is provided in writing by the Buyer, will not, on the date the
Seller Proxy Statement (or any supplement or amendment thereto) is first
mailed to stockholders of the Seller or on the date of the Seller
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit

order, rule, regulation, policy or agreement, or commencement of any

agreement which would have such a result.   4.13 TAXES AND TAX RETURNS.
Except as set forth in Section 4.13 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule:  
(a) Except where the failure to do so would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Seller Companies as a whole, the Seller and each of its
subsidiaries (referred to for     (17)   purposes of this Section 4.13,
collectively, as the "Seller Companies") have, since December 31, 1995,
timely filed in correct form all Tax Returns that were required to be filed
by any of them on or prior to the date hereof (the "Filed Tax Returns"), and
have paid all Taxes shown as being due thereon.   (b) No assessment that has
not been settled or otherwise resolved has been made with respect to Taxes
not shown on the Filed Tax Returns, other than such additional Taxes as are
being contested in good faith or which if determined adversely to the Seller
Companies would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Seller Companies as
a whole. The income Tax Returns of the Seller Companies have been examined by
the IRS or other taxing authority, as applicable, for all years through 1999

material disputes pending or written claims asserted for Taxes or assessments
upon any Seller Company, nor has any Seller Company been requested to give
any currently effective waivers extending the statutory period of limitation
applicable to any income Tax Return for any period. No deficiency in Taxes or
other proposed adjustment that has not been settled or otherwise resolved has
been asserted in writing by any taxing authority against any of the Seller
Companies, which if determined adversely to the Seller Companies would have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Seller Companies as a whole. To the best
knowledge of the Seller, no material Tax Return of any of the Seller
Companies is now under examination by any applicable taxing authority. There
are no material liens for Taxes (other than current Taxes not yet due and
payable) on any of the assets of any Seller Company, except for such liens
for Taxes that would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Seller
Companies as a whole.   (c) Adequate provision has been made on the Seller
Balance Sheet for all Taxes of the Seller Companies in respect of all periods

been withheld by each Seller Company from their respective employees for all
prior periods in compliance in all material respects with the tax withholding
provisions of applicable federal, state, county and local laws; (ii) federal,
state, county and local returns which are accurate and complete in all

the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed:  
(a) take any action that is intended or may reasonably be expected to result
in any of its representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement

any provision of this Agreement;   (b) take any action that is intended or

any commitment to, take any of the actions prohibited by this Section
5.3.   5.4 SYSTEM CONVERSIONS. From and after the date hereof, the
Buyer and the Seller shall meet on a regular basis to discuss how to
cooperate and plan for the conversion of the Seller\'s and its subsidiaries\'

arrangements, non-renewal of personal property leases and software licenses
used by the Seller or any of its subsidiaries in connection with its systems
operations, retention of outside consultants and additional employees to

or self-provided system services, it being understood that the Seller shall

the Effective Time. In the event that the Seller or any of its subsidiaries
takes, at the request of the Buyer, any action relative to third parties to

subsidiaries for any such fees, expenses and charges, and the cost of
reversing the conversion process, if for any reason the Merger is not
consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.     (33)   
5.5 CERTAIN CHANGES AND ADJUSTMENTS. Prior to the Closing, the Seller and its
subsidiaries shall modify or change its loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, tax,
litigation and real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan
classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that
is consistent with that of the Buyer; provided, however, that neither the
Seller nor any of its subsidiaries shall be obligated to take any
action pursuant to this Section 5.5 which is inconsistent with GAAP, the
rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable banking laws and regulations,
or to which the Seller\'s independent auditors object and, in any event,
unless and until the Buyer acknowledges, and the Seller and its subsidiaries
are satisfied, that all conditions to either party\'s obligation to
consummate the Merger have been satisfied and that the Buyer shall consummate
the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. No action taken by
the Seller or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 5.5 or the
consequences resulting therefrom shall be deemed to be a breach of any
representation, warranty, agreement or covenant herein or constitute a
Material Adverse Effect. In the event that the Seller or any of its
subsidiaries takes, at the request of the Buyer, any action pursuant to this
Section 5.5, the Buyer shall indemnify the Seller and its subsidiaries for
any fees, expenses and charges, and the costs of reversing the action taken,
if for any reason the Merger is not consummated in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.   5.6 BRANCHES. Except as set forth in Section 5.6 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, the Buyer and the Seller shall consult and
cooperate with each other concerning the alignment of the Buyer\'s and the
Seller Bank\'s branches following the Effective Time, and the Seller shall,
if requested by the Buyer, cooperate with the Buyer to cause the Seller Bank
to prepare and file, or to assist with the preparation and filing, of
applications and other notices with all appropriate Governmental Authorities
that may be necessary to close or consolidate such branches concurrently with
or after the Merger; provided that no such application or notice may be filed
earlier than two (2) weeks prior to the date of the Seller Stockholders
Meeting. If for any reason the Merger is not consummated in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, the Buyer shall reimburse the Seller and its
subsidiaries for any fees or expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation and filing of such applications at the request of the Buyer.  
5.7 SERVICING. If requested by the Buyer, the Seller shall, and shall cause
certain of its subsidiaries to, provide notices of termination with respect
to certain servicing arrangements of the Seller or its subsidiaries existing
as of the date hereof; provided, however, that, if for any reason the Merger
is not consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Buyer
shall indemnify the Seller and its subsidiaries for any fees,
expenses, charges, and the costs of reversing the action taken or entering
into a new servicing agreement on terms substantially similar to the
servicing arrangements so terminated pursuant to this Section 5.7.   5.8
PURCHASER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. From and after the date of this Agreement,
the Buyer and the Seller shall consult with each other on the introduction of
products and services not currently offered by the Seller Bank which the
Buyer would expect to make available to customers following the Effective
Time; provided, however, that nothing herein shall obligate the Seller to
offer any such products or services prior to the Effective Time.    
(34)    5.9 ALCO MANAGEMENT. The Seller and the Seller Bank agree to
manage their assets and liabilities in accordance with Seller\'s asset and
liability management policy as in effect on the date hereof, unless otherwise

such terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed upon by the Seller and
the Buyer and set forth in the Deposit Incentive Plan, it being understood
that any payments to be made under the Deposit Incentive Plan shall be paid
by the Buyer and not until after the system conversion. The Seller further
agrees that the Deposit Incentive Plan shall include, among other things,
deposit pricing, product structure and other initiatives designed to incent
management and branch staff to increase the deposits held by the Seller and
the Seller Bank through the period of the system conversion.   ARTICLE VI -

Agreement and the Merger.   (b) The Seller\'s Board of Directors has adopted
a resolution recommending approval and adoption of this Agreement and the

give the Buyer and its counsel the opportunity to review and discuss all
amendments and supplements to the Seller Proxy Statement and all responses to
requests for additional information and replies to comments prior to their
being filed with, or sent to, the SEC. Each of the Buyer and the Seller
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts, after consultation with the other
party hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of and requests by the
SEC and to cause the Seller Proxy Statement and all required amendments and
supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of Seller Common Stock
entitled to vote at the Seller Stockholders Meeting referred to in Section
6.1(a) hereof at the earliest practicable time (but in no event later than
two (2) weeks after clearance by the SEC).   (d) The parties hereto shall
cooperate with each other and use their reasonable best efforts to promptly
prepare and file all necessary documentation, to effect all applications,
notices, petitions and filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation,
the Merger and the Bank Merger), and to comply with the terms and conditions
of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all such
Governmental Authorities. The Buyer and the Seller shall have the right to
review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the
other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
information, all the information relating to the Buyer or the Seller, as the
case may be, and any of their respective subsidiaries, which appear in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree
that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated herein.   (e) The Buyer and the Seller shall, upon
request, furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their
subsidiaries, directors or trustees, as applicable, officers and stockholders
and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in
connection with the Seller Proxy Statement or any other statement, filing,
notice or application made by or on behalf of any Affiliate of the Buyer, the
Buyer or the Seller or any of their respective subsidiaries to any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (f) The Buyer and the
Seller shall promptly advise each other upon receiving (and the Buyer shall
so advise with respect to communications received by any Affiliate of the
Buyer) any communication from any Governmental Authority or third party whose
consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there
is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory    
(36)   Approval or third party consent will not be obtained or that the
receipt of any such approval will be materially delayed.   6.2 NO
SOLICITATION. Seller agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, it shall
not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its subsidiaries or any of its
or its subsidiaries\' directors, officers, employees, agents or
representatives (collectively, its "Agents") to, directly or indirectly,
solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or take any action to facilitate, or
furnish or disclose nonpublic information in furtherance of, any inquiries or
the making of any offer or proposal regarding, or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any
Person (other than the Buyer and its Affiliates or representatives)
concerning any Acquisition Transaction or enter into any definitive
agreement, arrangement or understanding for any Acquisition Transaction or
requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, that the Seller
or its Agents may furnish or cause to be furnished information to, and
negotiate or otherwise engage in discussions with, any individual or entity
that delivers a written proposal for an Acquisition Transaction that was not
solicited, knowingly encouraged or facilitated by the Seller or any of its
Agents after the date of this Agreement if and so long as (a) the Board of
Directors of the Seller determines (i) in good faith by a majority vote,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failing to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable laws
and (ii) that such a proposal is or would be reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal and (b) prior to furnishing any information to such
individual or entity, Seller shall enter into a confidentiality agreement
with such individual or entity that is no less restrictive, in any material
respect, than the Confidentiality Agreement dated September 16, 2002 by and
between Parent and Seller ("Confidentiality Agreement"), and Seller shall
enforce, and shall not waive any of the provisions of any such
confidentiality agreement. The Board of Directors of the Seller shall be
permitted to withdraw, modify or change in a manner adverse to the Buyer (or
not to continue to make) its recommendation to the Seller\'s stockholders
required under Section 6.1(b) hereof and/or to comply with Rule 14e-2 under
the Exchange Act with respect to an Acquisition Transaction if, but only if,
(x) after consultation with the Seller\'s outside legal counsel, the Board of
Directors of the Seller determines that failing to take such action,
in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Superior Proposal, would
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the
Seller under applicable law, (y) the Seller has given the Buyer five (5)
business days\' prior written notice of its intention to do so and the
Seller\'s Board of Directors has considered any changes to this Agreement (if
any) proposed by the Buyer and has determined, after consultation with the
Seller\'s outside legal counsel and after consultation with a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such unsolicited proposal
remains a Superior Proposal, and (z) the Seller has complied in all material
respects with this Section 6.2 (provided, that the foregoing shall in no way
limit or otherwise affect Buyer\'s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(f)) hereof. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any
such withdrawal, modification or change of the recommendation of the Board of
Directors of the Seller shall not change the approval of the Board of
Directors of the Seller for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or
other state     (37)   law to be inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  Seller immediately will cease, and shall
cause its Agents and subsidiaries and its subsidiaries\' Agents to cease, all
existing activities, discussions and negotiations with any individual or
entity conducted heretofore with respect to any proposal for an Acquisition
Transaction and request the return or destruction of all confidential
information regarding Seller or its subsidiaries provided to any such
individual or entity prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the
terms of any confidentiality agreements and the Seller shall enforce, and
shall not waive, any of the provisions of any such
confidentiality agreement.  From and after the execution of this Agreement,
Seller shall advise Buyer within the Notice Period of the receipt, directly
or indirectly, of any inquiries, discussions, negotiations, or proposals
relating to an Acquisition Transaction (including a summary of material and
significant terms thereof and the identity of the other individual or entity
or individuals or entities involved), or its receipt of any request for
information from the Federal Reserve Board, the OTS, the DOJ, or any other
Governmental Authority with respect to an Acquisition Transaction, and
promptly furnish to Buyer a copy of any such written proposal in addition to
a copy of any information provided to or by any third party relating thereto.
In addition, Seller shall immediately advise Buyer, in writing, if the Board
of Directors of the Seller shall make any determination as to any Acquisition
Transaction as contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence of this
Section 6.2. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 shall prohibit Seller
from, at any time, taking and disclosing to the Seller\'s stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or
making any disclosure required by Rule 14a-9 under the Exchange Act so long
as the requirements set forth in this Section 6.2 are satisfied. For the
purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona
fide Acquisition Transaction on terms the Board of Directors of the Seller
determines in its good faith judgment and taking into account the advice of a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation (taking into account
all the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Transaction, including any
break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
consummation, the likelihood and anticipated timing of consummation and all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the
individual or entity making the proposal) are in the aggregate more favorable
and provide greater value to all the Seller\'s stockholders than this
Agreement and the Merger taken as a whole. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Acquisition Transaction" means any offer or proposal for, or any indication
of interest in (a) a merger, tender offer, recapitalization, or
consolidation, or any similar transaction, involving the Seller or any
Significant Subsidiary of the Seller, (b) a purchase, lease or other
acquisition or assumption of all or a substantial portion of the assets
or deposits of the Seller or all or substantially all of the assets or
deposits of any Significant Subsidiary of the Seller, (c) a purchase or other
acquisition (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or
otherwise) of beneficial ownership (the term "beneficial ownership" for
purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder) of
securities representing ten percent (10%) or more of the voting power of the
Seller or any     (38)   Significant Subsidiary of the Seller, or (d)
any substantially similar transaction. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Notice Period" shall mean (i) with respect to written inquiries or
proposals or other written materials, written notice immediately and in no
event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt thereof and (y) with
respect to oral inquires, discussions, negotiations, or proposals, oral
notice immediately and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after
receipt thereof, followed by written notice in no event later than one (1)
business day after receipt of such oral inquires, discussions, negotiations,
or proposals. Nothing in this Section 6.2 shall affect Seller\'s obligation
to hold the Seller Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 6.1
hereof.   6.3 ACCESS TO INFORMATION.   (a) Upon reasonable notice and
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, each of
the Buyer and the Seller, for the purposes of verifying the representations
and warranties of the other and relating to the Merger and the other matters
contemplated by this Agreement, shall, and shall cause each of their
respective subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel and other representatives of the other party, access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all of its
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and, during such
period, each of the Buyer and the Seller shall, and shall cause their
respective subsidiaries to, make available to the other party (i) a copy of
each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal
securities laws or federal or state banking laws (other than reports
or documents which the Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be, is not
permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may
reasonably request. The Seller also shall provide the Buyer with reasonable
access to the Sellers officers, employees and agents and with copies of all
periodic reports to the Seller\'s senior management. Neither the Buyer nor
the Seller nor any of their respective subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would violate or prejudice the rights of the Buyer\'s or the Seller\'s, as
the case may be, customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding
agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties
hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.  
(b) All information furnished by any party hereto to the other or its
representatives pursuant hereto shall be treated as the sole property of the
party providing the information and, if the Merger shall not occur, the party
being furnished such information shall return to the other party all of such
written information and all documents, notes, summaries or other materials
containing, reflecting or referring to, or derived from, such information.
The parties hereto shall, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause their representatives to, keep confidential all such information, and
shall not directly or indirectly use such information for any competitive or
other commercial purpose. The obligation to keep such information    
(39)   confidential shall continue for five years from the date the
proposed Merger is abandoned and shall not apply to (i) any information which
(x) was already in the possession of the party being furnished such
information prior to the disclosure thereof by the other party, (y) was then
generally known to the public, or (z) was disclosed to the party being
furnished such information by a third party not bound by an obligation of
confidentiality; or (ii) disclosures made as required by law. In addition, in
the event that the Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(d) hereof, the restrictions contained in the ninth (9th) paragraph of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof.   (c) No investigation by either of the
parties or their respective representatives shall affect the representations
and warranties of the other set forth herein.   6.4 LEGAL CONDITIONS TO
MERGER. Each of the Buyer and its Affiliates and the Seller shall, and the
Seller shall cause its subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts (a)
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to
comply promptly with all legal requirements that may be imposed on such party
or its subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions
set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the other party
to obtain) any material consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Authority and any other third party that is
required to be obtained by the Buyer or the Seller or any of their respective
subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   6.5 EMPLOYMENT AND BENEFIT
MATTERS.   (a) Provision of Benefits. From and after the Effective Time,
the Buyer agrees to provide the employees of the Seller and its subsidiaries
(the "Seller Employees") who remain employed after the Effective Time with at
least the types and levels of employee benefits (including
employee contribution levels) maintained by the Buyer or any Affiliate of the
Buyer for similarly-situated employees of the Buyer. The Buyer will treat,
and cause the applicable benefit plans to treat, the service of Seller
Employees with Seller or any subsidiary of Seller attributable to any period
before the Effective Time as service rendered to the Buyer or any Affiliate
of Buyer for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and for other
appropriate benefits including, but not limited to, applicability of minimum
waiting periods for participation, but not for benefit accrual (including
minimum pension amount) or eligibility for retiree welfare benefit plans,
attributable to any period before the Effective Time. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Buyer shall not treat any employee of the Seller or any of its
subsidiaries as a "new" employee for purposes of any exclusions under any
health or similar plan of the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer for a pre-
existing medical condition, and any deductibles paid under any of Seller\'s
or its subsidiaries health plans shall be credited towards deductibles under
the health plans of the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer upon delivery to
the Buyer of appropriate documentation. The Buyer will make appropriate
arrangements with its insurance carrier(s) to ensure such result.    
(40)    (b) Continuation of Plans. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, the Buyer shall have sole discretion with
respect to the determination as to whether or when to terminate, merge or
continue any employee benefit plans and programs of the Seller, except with
respect to the Seller Bank employee stock ownership plan, which shall be
terminated as of the Effective Time, as provided in Section 6.6(h) hereof;
provided, however, that the Buyer shall continue to maintain the Seller plans
(other than stock based or incentive plans or stock funds in retirement
plans) until the Seller Employees are permitted to participate in the plans
of the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer. Nothing in this Agreement shall
alter or limit the Buyer\'s obligations, if any, under ERISA, as amended by
the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 and/or the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 with respect to the
rights of Seller Employees and their qualified beneficiaries in connection
with the group health plan maintained by the Seller as of the Effective
Time.   (c) Severance Pay. The Buyer shall pay any employee of the Seller
or any of its subsidiaries who is not otherwise covered by a
specific employment, termination, severance or change in control agreement
and who is terminated by the Buyer or its Affiliates for reasons other than
cause (which shall mean gross negligence or dereliction in the performance of
such employee\'s duties, dishonesty or commission of a crime) in the one (1)
year period immediately following the Effective Time, the severance and other
benefits set forth below:   (i) severance payable on an installment basis 
pursuant to regular payroll of the Buyer in an amount equal to  two (2) weeks
base salary multiplied by the number of full years  of service of such
terminated Seller employee to the Seller or  any subsidiary of Seller, as
recognized on the books of the  Seller; provided that all Seller Employees
shall be subject to a  minimum severance payment limitation of four (4) weeks
(except  that the minimum severance payment limitation for any Seller 
employee who has a title of Vice President or higher shall be  eight (8)
weeks) and a maximum severance payment limitation of  twenty-six (26) weeks
base salary;   (ii) continuation of health benefits during the same  period
of time that such terminated Seller employee is receiving  severance payments
pursuant to clause (i) above after  termination on the same terms and
conditions as though they had  remained active employees, and thereafter
shall be entitled to  COBRA benefits for an additional period of time
determined as  though their employment had terminated at the end of such 
period; and   (iii) out-placement services to terminated Seller  employees
consistent with the Buyer\'s past practices.   (d) Compensation Agreements.
Following the Effective Time, the Buyer and its Affiliates shall honor in
accordance with their terms all written employment, termination, severance,
change in control, and other compensation agreements all as disclosed in
Section 6.5(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (each, a "Compensation
Agreement"), and neither the     (41)   Buyer nor any Affiliate of
Buyer will challenge the validity of any obligation of the Seller or any
subsidiary of the Seller under any Compensation Agreement.   (e) Parachute
Payouts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
and except as set forth in Section 6.5(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
in no event shall the Seller, the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the
Surviving Bank or any of their respective subsidiaries take any action or
make any payments that would result, either individually or in the aggregate,
in the payment of an "parachute payment" within the meaning of Code Section
280G(b)(2) or that would result, either individually or in the aggregate, in
payments that would be nondeductible pursuant to Code Section 162(m). The
Seller and the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
matters relating to any of the foregoing.   (f) Continuation of Employment.
No provision of this Section 6.5 shall create any third party beneficiary
rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) of the Seller in respect of continued employment (or
resumed employment) with the Buyer or any of its Affiliates and no provision
of this Section 6.5 shall create such rights in any such persons in respect
of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any
employee program or any plan or arrangement which may be established by the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates. No provision of this Agreement shall
constitute a limitation on the rights to amend, modify or terminate after the
Effective Time any such plans or arrangements of the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates.   (g) Welfare Benefit Plans. The Seller shall use its, and
the Seller shall cause its subsidiaries to use their, reasonable best efforts

or the receipt of all required stockholder and regulatory approvals
(exclusive of any applicable waiting period) (such time referred to for
purposes of this Section 6.5(g) as the "Benefits Date"): (i) with respect to
the medical insurance program, the Seller shall enter into an agreement with
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island to offer to the Seller Employees the
Blue Card PPO product with the same plan design and level of benefits as that
being provided to the employees of the Buyer or Affiliates of the Buyer as of
the Benefits Date; (ii) with respect to the dental insurance program, the
Seller shall change its current program for the Seller Employees to the
extent necessary to cause the plan design and level of benefits to be
identical to that being provided to employees of the Buyer or Affiliates of
the Buyer as of the Benefits Date; and (iii) with respect to the life
insurance program, the Seller shall change its current program for the Seller
Employees to the extent necessary to cause the plan design and level of
benefits to be identical to that being provided to employees of the Buyer or
Affiliates of the Buyer as of the Benefits Date. In the event that the Seller
or any of its subsidiaries takes, at the request of the Buyer, any of the
foregoing actions that results in imposition of any fees, expenses
or charges, the Buyer shall indemnify the Seller and its subsidiaries for any
such fees, expenses and charges, if for any reason the Merger is not
consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

participants and beneficiaries in accordance with applicable law and the
Seller Bank employee stock ownership plan. Prior to the Effective Time,
contributions to, and payments on the loan of, the Seller Bank employee stock
ownership plan shall be made consistent with past practices on the regularly
scheduled payment dates.   6.6 DIRECTORS\' AND OFFICERS\' INDEMNIFICATION
AND INSURANCE.   (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation in which any person who is now, or has been at
any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director or officer or employee of Seller or any of its
subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a
party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee
of the Seller, any of the Seller\'s subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors, or is or was serving at the request of the Seller or the Seller
Bank as a director, officer or employee of an Affiliate or (ii) this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case
asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto
agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and respond
thereto. It is understood and agreed that after the Effective Time, the Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by
law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding
or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened
or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and in the event
of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation (whether asserted of arising before or after the Effective
Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
them after consultation with the Buyer; provided, however, that (w) the Buyer
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and upon such assumption
the Buyer or the Surviving Bank shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party
for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if the Buyer elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that there are
issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Buyer and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to them after consultation with the Buyer, and the Buyer shall
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties, (x) the Buyer shall be obligated     (43)   pursuant to this
paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties,
unless the proposed counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises
the Indemnified Parties that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest among such parties, in which case the Buyer shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of additional counsel to the extent necessary to avoid such
conflict, (y) the Buyer shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) and (z) the Buyer shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction
shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final
and nonappealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. Any Indemnified
Party wishing to claim Indemnification under this Section 6.6, upon learning
of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify
the Buyer thereof, provided, that the failure to so notify shall not affect
the obligations of the Buyer under this Section 6.6 except to the extent
such failure to notify materially prejudices the Buyer. The Buyer\'s
obligations under this Section 6.6 shall continue in full force and effect
for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time; provided, however,
that all rights to indemnification in respect of any claim asserted or made
within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
claim.   (b) The Buyer shall maintain the Seller\'s (including
its subsidiaries\') existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance

Seller\'s DandO; Insurance for a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time on terms no less favorable than those in effect on the date hereof and
shall at the Effective Time provide evidence of such extension of coverage to
the Seller; provided, however, that the Buyer may substitute therefor
policies providing substantially comparable coverage and containing terms and
conditions no less favorable than those in effect on the date hereof. In
connection with the foregoing, the Seller agrees to provide such insurer or
substitute insurer with such representations as such insurer may reasonably
request with respect to the reporting of any prior claims.   (c) In the
event the Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Buyer assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.6.   (d) The provisions of this
Section 6.6 are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives, and nothing
herein shall affect any indemnification rights that any Indemnified Party and
his or her heirs and representatives may have under the Articles of
Incorporation or By-Laws of the Seller or the equivalent documents of any of
the Seller\'s subsidiaries, any contract or applicable law.    
(44)    6.7 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or the

necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense
of, the Buyer.   6.8 ADVICE OF CHANGES. The Buyer and the Seller shall each
promptly notify the other party of any change or event having a Material

to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice.   6.9 UPDATE OF DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES. From time to time prior to
the Effective Time, the Seller will promptly supplement or amend the

occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or which is
necessary to correct any information in the Seller Disclosure Schedule which
has been rendered inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to the

or compliance by the Seller with the covenants set forth in Article V
hereof.   6.10 CURRENT INFORMATION.   (a) As soon as practicable, the
Seller will furnish to the Buyer copies of all such financial statements and

stockholders of the Seller without obtaining such approval. Any agreement on
the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but
such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with
an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver

Agreement and Plan of Merger and proceeding with the transactions
contemplated thereby, and in consideration of the expenses incurred and to be
incurred by the Buyer in connection therewith, the Stockholder and the Buyer
agree as follows:   1. The Stockholder, while this Agreement is in effect,
shall vote or cause to be voted all of the Shares that such Stockholder shall
be entitled to so vote, whether such Shares are beneficially owned by such
Stockholder on the date of this Agreement or are subsequently acquired, at
the special meeting of the Seller\'s stockholders to be called and held
following the date hereof (the "Special Meeting"), for the approval of the
Agreement and Plan of Merger and transactions contemplated thereby, including
the Merger, and, while this Agreement is in effect, shall vote or cause to be
voted all such Shares, at the Special Meeting or any other meeting of the
Seller\'s stockholders following the date hereof, against the approval of any
other agreement providing for a merger, acquisition, consolidation, sale of a
material amount of assets or other business combination of the Seller or any
of its subsidiaries with any person or entity other than the Buyer or any
subsidiary of the Buyer.   2. While this Agreement is in effect, prior to

otherwise dispose of (including, without limitation, by the creation of a
Lien (as defined in Section 3 below)), or permit to be sold, assigned,
transferred or     otherwise disposed of, any Shares owned by the
Stockholder, whether such Shares are held by the Stockholder on the date of

ONLY IN  COMPLIANCE THEREWITH. COPIES OF THE ABOVE-REFERENCED AGREEMENT ARE

The Stockholder further represents and warrants that this Agreement (assuming
this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Buyer)
constitutes a valid and binding agreement with respect to the Stockholder,
enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms, except as
enforcement may be limited by general principles of equity whether applied in
a court of law or a court of equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency and similar
laws affecting creditors\' rights and remedies generally. Except as set forth
on Schedule 1, the Stockholder represents and warrants that the Stockholder
beneficially owns the number of Shares indicated opposite such Stockholder\'s
name on Schedule 1, free and clear of any liens, claims, charges or other
encumbrances or restrictions of any kind whatsoever ("Liens"), and has sole
or shared, and otherwise unrestricted, voting power with respect to

extent not exercised in accordance with its terms prior to the Effective
Time, each option to purchase Shares listed on such Schedule shall be
automatically cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount of
cash determined in the manner set forth in the Agreement and Plan of
Merger.   4. The agreements with respect to voting and transfer contained
in Section 1 and, Section 2, respectively, hereof shall remain in full force
and effect until the earlier of (a) the     2   consummation of the
Merger or (b) the termination of the Agreement and Plan of Merger in
accordance with Article VIII thereof.   5. The Stockholder has signed this
Agreement intending to be legally bound thereby. The Stockholder expressly
agrees that this Agreement shall be specifically enforceable in any court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with its terms against the Stockholder.
All of the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement shall be
binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the respective parties and their
permitted successors, assigns, heirs, executors, administrators and other
legal representatives, as the case may be.   6. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed an
original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.   7. No waivers of any breach of this Agreement extended by the
Buyer to the Stockholder shall be construed as a waiver of any rights or
remedies of the Buyer with respect to any other stockholder of the Seller who
has executed a copy of this Agreement with respect to Shares held or
subsequently held by such stockholder or with respect to any subsequent
breach of the Stockholder or any other such stockholder of the Seller.   8.
This Agreement is deemed to be signed as a sealed instrument and is to be
governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof. If any
provision hereof is deemed unenforceable, the enforceability of the other
provisions hereof shall not be affected.   9. The Stockholder is executing
this Agreement only in the Stockholder\'s capacity as a stockholder of the
Seller, and not in the Stockholder\'s capacity as a director, trustee,
officer or employee of the Seller or any of its subsidiaries. Nothing
contained herein shall be construed to create any obligation on the part of
the Stockholder in such Stockholder\'s capacity as a director, trustee,
officer or employee of the Seller or any of its subsidiaries.
