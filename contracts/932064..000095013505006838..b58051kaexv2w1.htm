The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP on the later to occur of (a) December 23, 2005 or (b) two (2) Business Days following the date after the last of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ shall have been fulfilled or waived (excluding the delivery at the Closing of any of the documents set forth in _Article VIII_ ), or such other date or at such other time and place as Acquiror and the Company shall mutually agree in writing (such date hereinafter, the " _Closing Date_ "). 

  

 SECTION 2.3 _Filing of Merger Documents; Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective when the Certificate of Merger, to be prepared by the Acquiror in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, is accepted for record by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or such later time as may be agreed to by the parties and set forth in such Certificate of Merger. When used in this Agreement, the term " _Effective Time_ " shall mean the later of the date and time at which the Certificate of Merger is accepted for record or the date and time set forth in the Certificate of Merger. 

  

 SECTION 2.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the DGCL. 

  

 SECTION 2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the Company or Merger Sub, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be 

    ##### 

  

    

amended to read in its entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger
Sub reads as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or applicable Law, provided
that such certificate of incorporation shall reflect as of the Effective Time
Cyota, Inc. as the name of the Surviving Corporation. The Bylaws of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or the Certificate of Incorporation and applicable Law. 

   

 (b) The directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be a director or officer or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

   

 SECTION 2.6 _Conversion of Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Capital Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) Each share of Company Capital Stock that is held in the treasury of the Company and each share of Company Capital Stock owned by Acquiror, Merger Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Acquiror shall be cancelled and retired and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (b) Each share of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares of Company Capital Stock to be cancelled in accordance with  _Section 2.6(a)_ and other than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) All such shares of Company Capital Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired, and each certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ ") representing any such shares of Company Capital Stock shall cease to represent Company Capital Stock and shall represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each such share of Company Capital Stock, to be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

   

 (d) Each issued and outstanding share of the capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become as of the Effective Time one fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 (a) As of the Effective Time, all Company Options, whether vested or unvested, and the Company Option Plans, insofar as they relate to Company Options outstanding under such plans as of the Closing, shall be assumed by the Acquiror. Immediately after the Effective Time, each Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Option at the Effective Time, such number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock as is equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject 

    ##### 

  

    

to the unexercised portion of such Company Option multiplied by the Conversion
Ratio (with any fraction resulting from such multiplication to be rounded
down to the nearest whole number). The exercise price per share of each such
assumed Company Option shall be equal to the exercise price of such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by the Conversion
Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Except for the acceleration of
unvested Company Options immediately prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with the provisions of Section 6.16 and except as otherwise
provided in _Section 4.16(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the term,
exercisability, vesting schedule, status as an "incentive stock option" under
Section 422 of the Code, if applicable, and all of the other terms of the
Company Options assumed by Acquiror pursuant to this Section 2.7(a) shall
otherwise remain unchanged. 

   

 (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to the holders of Company Options assumed by Acquiror pursuant to Section 2.7(a) appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to such Company Options, as amended by this Section 2.7, and the agreements evidencing such Company Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the amendments provided for in this Section 2.7 and such notice). 

   

 (c) The Acquiror shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Company Options assumed in accordance with Section 2.7(a). Within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Acquiror shall file a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) under the Securities Act with respect to all shares of Acquiror Common Stock subject to such Company Options that may be registered on a Form S-8, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such Registration Statement for so long as such Company Options remain outstanding. 

   

 (d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Acquiror shall cause its Israeli counsel to prepare and file with the Israeli Securities Authority an application for an exemption from the requirements of the Israeli Securities Law (1968) concerning the publication of a prospectus in respect of the exchange of the Company Options for the Assumed Options, pursuant to Section 15D of the Securities Law of Israel (the "Israeli Securities Exemption"). The Company shall cooperate and cause its Representatives to cooperate with Acquiror and its Israeli counsel in connection with the preparation and filing of such application and in the preparation of any written or oral submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Israeli Securities Exemption.

The Company shall (a) use reasonable best efforts to cause each Missing Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and not previously exercised and (b) cause each Warrant other than a Missing Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and not previously exercised to be terminated upon the Effective Time. Upon the cancellation of each Warrant, each holder thereof (each, a "Warrantholder") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company shall take such action as shall be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.8. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 2.9 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Dissenting Shares shall not be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of such shares of Company Capital Stock shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, subject to the DGCL, such shares of Company Capital Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, in accordance with this _Article II_ and  _Article III_. The Company shall give Acquiror (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any other related instruments received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Acquiror, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demand. The payout of consideration under this Agreement to the stockholders of the Company (other than to holders of Dissenting Shares who shall be treated as provided in this Section 2.9 and under Delaware Law) shall not be affected by the exercise or potential exercise of appraisal rights under Delaware Law by any other stockholder of the Company. 

  

 SECTION 2.10 _Adjustments Before and After the Closing_. The Base Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment as follows: 

  

 (a) Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to the Acquiror a good faith estimate of the balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (the "Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet") prepared in accordance with the provisions relating to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet set forth in this Section 2.10. The Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet shall be accompanied by (i) a statement setting forth the Companys good faith estimate of the amount, if any, by which the estimated Net Working Capital (the "Preliminary Net Working Capital") is greater than, or less than, the Target Amount, and (ii) all relevant backup materials and schedules relating to the calculation of the Preliminary Net Working Capital, in detail reasonably acceptable to the Acquiror. In calculating the Preliminary Net Working Capital, the Preliminary Balance Sheet shall include as liabilities estimates of the full amount of the transaction fees and expenses payable by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including legal and accounting fees, to the extent such transaction fees and expenses will not have been paid prior to the Closing Date. The Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the calculations showing the basis for the determination of such sums. If the Preliminary Net Working Capital on the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet is less than the Target Amount, then the difference shall be deducted from the Base Purchase Price (the Base Purchase Price, as so adjusted, is referred to as the "Preliminary Base Purchase Price"). If the Preliminary Net Working Capital on the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet is greater than the Target Amount, then there shall be no adjustment to the Base Purchase Price. 

   

 (b) Not later than 90 calendar days after the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall deliver to the Stockholders Representative the Closing Balance Sheet. The Closing Balance 

    ##### 

  

    

Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently with the
Companys past practices (to the extent such past practices are consistent
with GAAP), except that the Closing Balance Sheet may exclude all footnotes,
subject to the adjustments set forth in this Section 2.10 (which shall be in
addition to and not in lieu of those required by GAAP) and shall be certified
as such by the Acquiror. The Closing Balance Sheet delivered pursuant to this
paragraph (b) shall be accompanied by (i) a statement setting forth the
amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital is greater than, or less
than, the Target Amount, and (ii) all relevant backup materials and schedules
relating to the calculation of the Net Working Capital, in detail reasonably
acceptable to the Stockholders Representative. The Acquiror and the
Surviving Corporation shall make such information, personnel and resources
available to the Stockholders Representative as may be reasonably necessary
to enable the Stockholders Representative to review the Closing
Balance Sheet; provided that the obligation of the Acquiror and the Surviving
Corporation to provide such information, personnel and resources shall be
limited to normal business hours with reasonable prior notice and in such a
manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of
their business. 

   

 (c) In calculating the Net Working Capital, the Closing Balance Sheet shall include as liabilities the full amount of the transaction fees and expenses payable by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including legal and accounting fees, to the extent such transaction fees and expenses were not paid prior to the Effective Time. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the calculations showing the basis for the determination of such sums. 

   

 (d) In the event that the Stockholders Representative disputes the Closing Balance Sheet or the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital, the Stockholders Representative shall notify the Acquiror in writing (the "Stockholders Representatives Dispute Notice") of the amount, nature and basis of such dispute, within 45 calendar days after delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet. In the event of such a dispute, the Acquiror and the Stockholders Representative shall first use their diligent good faith efforts to resolve such dispute among themselves. If the Acquiror and the Stockholders Representative are unable to resolve the dispute within 30 calendar days after delivery of the Stockholders Representatives Dispute Notice then any remaining items in dispute (the "Unresolved Objections") shall be submitted to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or, if such firm is unwilling or unable to serve in such capacity, an independent nationally recognized accounting firm selected in writing by the Stockholders Representative and the Acquiror or, if the Stockholders Representative and the Acquiror fail or refuse to select such a firm within 10 calendar days after written request therefor by the Stockholders Representative or the Acquiror, such an independent nationally recognized accounting firm shall be selected in accordance with the rules of the Boston, Massachusetts office of the AAA (the "Neutral Accountant"). 

   

 (e) The Acquiror and the Stockholders Representative shall jointly submit to the Neutral Accountant, within 10 days after the date of the engagement of the Neutral Accountant (as evidenced by the date of the engagement agreement), a copy of the Closing Balance Sheet, a copy of the Stockholders Representatives Dispute Notice and a list of the Unresolved Objections. Each of the Acquiror and the Stockholders Representative shall submit to the Neutral Accountant (with a copy delivered to the other party on the same day), within 30 days after the date of the engagement of the Neutral Accountant, a memorandum (which may 

    ##### 

  

    

include supporting exhibits) setting forth their respective positions on the
Unresolved Objections. Each of the Acquiror and the Stockholders
Representative may (but shall not be required to) submit to the Neutral
Accountant (with a copy delivered to the other party on the same day), within
60 days after the date of the engagement of the Neutral Accountant, a
memorandum responding to the initial memorandum submitted to the Neutral
Accountant by the other party. Unless requested by the Neutral Accountant in
writing, neither the Acquiror nor the Stockholders Representative may
present any additional information or arguments to the Neutral
Accountant, either orally or in writing. 

   

 (f) The Acquiror and the Stockholders Representative shall instruct the Neutral Accountant that (i) the scope of its review and authority shall be limited to resolving the Unresolved Objections, (ii) in resolving the Unresolved Objections, the Neutral Accountant shall determine an appropriate value for each Closing Balance Sheet item that is the subject of an Unresolved Objection, which value shall be equal to one of, or between, the values proposed by the Acquiror in the Closing Balance Sheet and by the Stockholders Representative in the Stockholders Representatives Dispute Notice, and (iii) issue a ruling which sets forth the resolution of each Unresolved Objection and includes a statement setting forth the Net Working Capital, reflecting the Neutral Accountants resolution of the Unresolved Objections. All determinations pursuant to this paragraph (f) shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the Acquiror and the Stockholders Representative. The determination of the Neutral Accountant as to the resolution of any dispute shall be binding and conclusive upon all parties. A judgment on the determination made by the Neutral Accountant pursuant to this Section 2.10 may be entered in and enforced by any court having jurisdiction thereover. 

   

 (g) The fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant in connection with the resolution of disputes pursuant to paragraphs (e) and (f) above shall be shared equally by the Sellers, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the other hand; provided that if the Neutral Accountant determines that one such party has adopted a position or positions with respect to the Closing Balance Sheet or the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital that is frivolous or clearly without merit, the Neutral Accountant may, in its discretion, assign a greater portion of any such fees and expenses to such party. 

   

 (h) Immediately upon the expiration of the 45-day period for giving the Stockholders Representatives Dispute Notice, if no such notice is given, or upon notification by the Stockholders Representative to the Acquiror that no such notice will be given, or immediately upon the resolution of disputes, if any, pursuant to this Section 2.10, the Preliminary Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows (as so adjusted, the "Adjusted Base Purchase Price"): 

    

 (i) If the Closing Net Working Capital is less than the Target Amount, then the amount of such deficiency, minus the amount, if any, previously subtracted from the Base Purchase Price in the determination of the Preliminary Base Purchase Price, shall be deducted from the Base Purchase Price to obtain the Adjusted Base Purchase Price; and 

   

 (ii) If the Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the Target Amount, then there shall be no adjustment to the Base Purchase Price; provided, 

   ##### 

  

   

however, that if the Closing Net Working Capital is greater than the
Preliminary Net Working Capital the amount of such excess shall be added to
the Preliminary Base Purchase Price to obtain the Adjusted Base Purchase
Price. In no event shall any such adjustment increase the Adjusted Base
Purchase Price to an amount greater than $136,000,000. 

  

 SECTION 2.11 _Payments on Account of Adjustments_. The difference, if any, between the Adjusted Base Purchase Price and the Preliminary Base Purchase Price shall be paid by wire transfer (a) from the Escrow Fund, by instructions provided by the Acquiror and the Stockholders Representative to the Escrow Agent, in the case of a deficiency pursuant to Section 2.10(h)(i) hereof, and (b) by the Acquiror to the Stockholders Representative, for distribution to the Sellers, in the case of a surplus pursuant to Section 2.10(h)(ii) hereof, in each case immediately upon the expiration of the 45-day period for giving the Stockholders Representatives Dispute Notice, if no Stockholders Representatives Dispute Notice is given, or upon notification by the Stockholders Representative that no Stockholders Representatives Dispute Notice will be given, or immediately upon final resolution of any dispute in connection with the determination of the Adjusted Base Purchase Price. 

  

ARTICLE III 
 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; PAYMENT OF 
 ESCROW FUND 

   

 SECTION 3.1 _Exchange of Shares._  

   

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Acquiror shall appoint the Paying Agent to effect the payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange for Certificates. On the Closing Date, the Acquiror shall deliver to the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the Sellers, cash in the amount of the aggregate Merger Consideration minus the Escrow Amount. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time and after the receipt by the Paying Agent of a certified stockholder list, the Acquiror shall cause the Paying Agent to send a notice and a transmittal form in customary form to each holder of a Certificate advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for surrendering to the Paying Agent such Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.6. The letters of transmittal mailed to each holder of record of a Certificate shall allow such holder, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, to elect to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Article II and this Article III by wire transfer in immediately available funds if such holders aggregate Merger Consideration is in excess of $1,000,000. Each holder of a Certificate, upon proper surrender thereof to the Paying Agent in accordance with the instructions in such notice, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (subject to any taxes required to be withheld) the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.6, minus such holders pro rata share (based upon the ratio that the aggregate Merger Consideration payable to such holder bears to the aggregate Merger Consideration) of the Escrow Amount (the "Closing Merger Consideration"). Until properly surrendered, each such Certificate shall be deemed for all purposes to evidence only the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.6. Holders of Certificates shall not be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration to which they would otherwise be entitled until such Certificates are properly surrendered. The exchange procedures shall comply with such procedures as may be 

    ##### 

  

    

required by the Israeli Withholding Tax Pre-Ruling (as defined in Section
6.11), if obtained, and shall permit Acquiror (after consultation with the
Company) to require holders of Certificates to provide any information as is
reasonably needed to comply with the Israeli Withholding Tax Pre-Ruling. 

   

 (b) If the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to the payment of such Merger Consideration that (i) the Certificate so surrendered shall be transferable, and shall be properly assigned, endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers, (ii) such transfer shall otherwise be proper and (iii) the person requesting such transfer shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes payable by reason of the foregoing or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such taxes have been paid or are not required to be paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth herein, neither the Paying Agent nor any other party shall be liable to a holder of Company Capital Stock for any Merger Consideration paid to such holder pursuant to Section 2.6 that is delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

   

 (c) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Acquiror shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Closing Merger Consideration payable in exchange therefor. In the case of a lost Certificate representing the right to receive Merger Consideration in excess of $1,000,000, the Board of Directors of the Acquiror may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to give the Acquiror a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Acquiror with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

   

 SECTION 3.2 _Escrow Fund_. On the Closing Date the Acquiror, the Company, the Stockholders Representative and Boston Trust and Investment Management Company, as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), shall enter into an escrow agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit A_ (the "Escrow Agreement"). At the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deliver to the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amount (such amount, together with interest earned thereon, the " _Escrow Fund_ ") by wire transfer or delivery of other immediately available funds, such amount to be held and disposed of by the Escrow Agent as provided in the Escrow Agreement, which amount shall be deemed withheld from the aggregate Merger Consideration for the purpose of securing the indemnification obligations of the Sellers set forth in this Agreement and satisfying the adjustments to the Base Purchase Price set forth in Sections 2.10 and 2.11 hereof. The Escrow Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof. The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company shall constitute approval of the Escrow Agreement and of all of the arrangements relating thereto, including the placement of the Escrow Fund in escrow and the appointment of the Stockholders Representative. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 3.3 _No Further Ownership Rights in Shares of Company Capital Stock; Closing of Company Transfer Books_. At and after the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate shall cease to have any rights as a stockholder of the Company, except for, in the case of a holder of a Certificate (other than a Certificate representing shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ or Dissenting Shares), the right to surrender his or her Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Article II_ and this _Article III_ or, in the case of a holder of Dissenting Shares, to perfect his or her right to receive payment for his or her shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the DGCL and no transfer of shares of Company Capital Stock shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and no transfer of shares of Company Capital Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided for in this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 3.4 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger. 

  

 SECTION 3.5 _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Acquiror, the Company, the Merger Sub, and the Escrow Agent (or their agents) shall have the right to deduct and withhold Taxes from any payments to be made hereunder (including any payments to be made under the Escrow Agreement) if such withholding is required by law, including, without limitation, the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance [New Version] 1961, as amended, and to collect any necessary Tax forms, including Form W-9 or the appropriate series of Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information, from the Sellers and any other recipients of payments hereunder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the Sellers or other recipient of payments in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. If the Israeli Option Tax Ruling contemplated by Section 6.11 is obtained, then, at the request of the holder of any shares resulting from the exercise of Company Options held in trust under a "Section 102 Plan" at the Effective Time, the Acquiror and the Escrow Agent will make payment of the applicable consideration that such holder is entitled to receive in exchange for such shares directly to the "Section 102 Plan" trustee in accordance with the terms of such ruling.

in satisfaction thereof. " _Officer s Certificate_" shall mean a certificate
signed by any Indemnified Party (or in the case of an Indemnified Party that

 (e) _Resolution of Conflicts_. In case the Stockholders Representative shall object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Officers Certificate to recover Losses from the Escrow Fund within thirty (30) days after receipt of such Officers Certificate by the Stockholders Representative, the Stockholders Representative and Acquiror shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims.

 (f) _Notice of Claim_. Any Person making a claim for indemnification pursuant to  _Article VII_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") must give the party from whom indemnification is sought (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") written notice of such claim (an " _Indemnification Claim Notice_ ") 

    ##### 

  

    

promptly after the Indemnified Party receives any written notice of any
action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim (a " _Proceeding_
") against or involving the Indemnified Party by any third party; _provided_
that the failure to notify or delay in notifying an Indemnifying Party will
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations pursuant to _Article
VII_, except to the extent that such failure materially harms the
Indemnifying Party. Such notice must contain a reasonable description of the
claim and the nature and amount of such Loss, in each case to the extent then
known. 

   

 (g) _Indemnification Procedure_. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its sole discretion and expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice, reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and to assume the defense of any Proceeding that relates to any Losses for which indemnification may be sought hereunder; provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party may only assume control of such defense if (A) it acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that any damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that may be assessed against the Indemnified Party in connection with such Proceeding constitute Losses for which the Indemnified Party shall be indemnified pursuant to this Article VII, (B) the ad damnum is less than or equal to the amount of Losses for which the Indemnifying Party is liable under this Article VII and the unclaimed balance of the Escrow Fund, and (C) an adverse resolution of the Proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on the goodwill or reputation of the Indemnified Party or the business, operations or future conduct of the Indemnified Party and (ii) the Indemnifying Party may not assume control of the defense of an Proceeding involving criminal liability or in which equitable relief is sought against the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not, or is not permitted under the terms hereof to, so assume control of the defense of a Proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The Non-controlling Party may participate in such defense at its own expense. The Controlling Party shall keep the Non-controlling Party advised of the status of such Proceeding and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with respect to such Proceeding (including copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such Proceeding. The fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party with respect to an Proceeding shall be considered Losses for purposes of this Agreement if (I) the Indemnified Party controls the defense of such Proceeding pursuant to the terms of this Section 7.4(g) or (II) the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests or different defenses available with respect to such Proceeding. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that the consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required if the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or judgment and such settlement or judgment includes a complete release of the Indemnified Party from further liability and has no other adverse effect on the Indemnified Party. Except as provided in Section 7.4(h) below, the Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (h) _Right to Settle Certain Claims_. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 7.4, if a third party asserts (other than by means of a lawsuit) that an Indemnified Party is liable to such third party for a monetary or other obligation which may constitute or result in Losses for which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII, and such Indemnified Party reasonably determines that it has a valid business reason to fulfill such obligation, then (i) such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to satisfy such obligation, without prior notice to or consent from the Indemnifying Party, (ii) such Indemnified Party may subsequently make a claim for indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this Article VII, and (iii) such Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed, in accordance with the provisions of this Article VII, for any such Losses which the Indemnified Party proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, it is entitled to recover pursuant to this Article VII (subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to dispute the Indemnified Partys entitlement to indemnification, the reasonableness of the amount the Indemnified Party expended to satisfy such obligation, or the amount, if any, for which it is entitled to indemnification, under the terms of this Article VII), it being agreed that the amount the Indemnified Party paid in connection with such settlement shall not, in and of itself, constitute conclusive evidence of the amount of Losses the Indemnified Party is entitled to recover under this Article VII. 

   

 (i) _Net Losses_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties acknowledge that (i) any insurance proceeds that are actually obtained by the Indemnified Party with respect to Losses and (ii) any recoveries that are actually obtained by the Indemnified Party from any third party shall be taken into account in calculation of the Losses incurred or suffered by the Indemnified Party to the extent the Indemnified Partys Losses are actually reduced as a result thereof; provided, however, that no Indemnified Party shall be obligated to pursue any such insurance proceeds or other recovery. 

   

 (j) _Adjustment for Indemnification Payments_. Any payments made to an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article VII or pursuant to the Escrow Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the purchase price paid to the Sellers for tax purposes.

Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section 10.3_.

 SECTION 10.13 _Designation of the Stockholders  Representative_. 

  

 (a) Each Seller, by his or her adoption of this Agreement or by his or her acceptance of the Merger Consideration, hereby designates Andrew Zalasin as the representative and attorney in fact of such Seller (the " _Stockholders  Representative_") for all purposes of this Agreement and related agreements, including, without limitation, full power and authority on behalf of such Seller to: (i) take all actions necessary in connection with the post-closing implementation of this Agreement and related agreements; (ii) negotiate, settle, compromise and otherwise handle all claims for indemnification made by an Acquiror Indemnitee pursuant to this Agreement; (iii) enter into the Escrow Agreement and to act pursuant thereto; and (iv) enter into a waiver or amendment of the Escrow Agreement or the Agreement after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 10.13_ shall not authorize or empower the Stockholders Representative to do or cause to be done any of the foregoing (i) in a manner that improperly discriminates between or among the Sellers or (ii) as to any matter insofar as such matter relates solely and exclusively to a single Seller. Without implying that other actions would constitute an improper discrimination, each of the Sellers agrees that discrimination between or among Sellers solely on the basis of the respective number of Shares held by each Seller shall not be deemed to be improper. Each of the Sellers hereby agrees that his, her or its appointment of the Stockholders Representative under this _Section 10.13_ is irrevocable and is coupled with an interest. The Stockholders Representative shall not receive any compensation for serving as such and agrees that his interest in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitutes good, valuable and sufficient consideration for serving as such. 

   

 (b) In the event that the Stockholders Representative dies, becomes legally incapacitated or resigns from such position, Scott Ring shall be the Stockholders Representative (and, if both Andrew Zalasin and Scott Ring have died, become legally incapacitated or resigned, then such Person as is appointed by the stockholders of the Company who held a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Stockholders Representative); however, no change in the Stockholders Representative shall   ##### 

  

  

  

be effective prior to the delivery to Acquiror of written notice thereof from
the stockholders of the Company who held a majority of the shares of Company
Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) As among the Sellers, the Stockholders Representative shall be fully justified and protected in relying upon any document or information furnished to him by any Seller, upon any evidence deemed by the Stockholders Representative to be reliable and upon any advice of counsel selected by him. As among the Sellers, the Stockholders Representative shall be fully justified and protected in failing or refusing or delaying to take any action unless he shall have received such advice of counsel or approval of such Seller as he deems appropriate or unless he shall have been expressly indemnified to his satisfaction by all Sellers. 

   

 (d) All decisions and actions by the Stockholders Representative which are taken in good faith shall be binding upon the Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. The Stockholders Representative shall have no duties or obligations hereunder except those specifically set forth in this Agreement and in the Escrow Agreement and such duties and obligations shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. Each Seller shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholders Representative and its successors, permitted assigns, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, " _Stockholders  Representative Indemnitees_") against all expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts (collectively "Stockholders Representative Expenses") incurred by a Stockholders Representative Indemnitee in connection with any Action, suit or proceeding to which such Stockholders Representative Indemnitee is made a party by reason of the fact it is or was acting as, on behalf of or in connection with, the Stockholders Representative under this Agreement or its relationship to the Stockholders Representative, and shall promptly reimburse the Stockholders Representative for all Stockholders Representative Expenses upon request therefor, except for fraud or actions or omissions taken in bad faith. No Stockholders Representative Indemnitee nor any agent employed by it shall incur any liability to any stockholder of the Company, holder of Company Options or holder of Warrants relating to the performance of its duties hereunder except for actions or omissions constituting fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct, or taken or omitted to be taken in bad faith. Without prejudice to the foregoing, no Stockholders Representative Indemnitee shall have liability in respect of any action, claim or proceeding brought against the Stockholders Representative Indemnitee by any Seller if the Stockholders Representative took or omitted taking any action in good faith. 

   

 SECTION 10.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, to the
extent any of the investment income earned on the Escrow Funds is taxable
income to the Acquiror, upon written request delivered by the Acquiror (with
a copy to the Shareholders Representative) from time to time, the Escrow
Agent shall distribute to the Acquiror from the Escrow Funds an
amount reasonably estimated by the Acquiror to reimburse the Acquiror

event of non-compliance with the preceding sentence, the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended from time to time, may require withholding of a
portion of any interest and other income earned on the investment of the
Escrow Funds.

  ##### 

  

   

     |   |   | of any agreement other than this Agreement. Unless
otherwise determined in this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be bound
by any notice of a claim, or demand with respect thereto, or any waiver,
modification, amendment, termination, cancellation, or revision of this
Agreement, unless it is in writing and signed by the Acquiror and the
Stockholders Representative, and received by the Escrow Agent, and, if
the Escrow Agents duties as Escrow Agent hereunder are affected, unless the
Escrow Agent shall have given its prior written consent thereto.  
---|---|---|--- 
    
     | 11.2.  |   | The Escrow Agent may rely and shall be protected in
acting or refraining from acting upon any written instructions or

Agent shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity or
accuracy of any such document. The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to
solicit any funds that may be deliverable to it under the terms of this

provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any
action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held
in escrow until it shall be directed otherwise in writing jointly by
the Acquiror and the Stockholders Representative or by a Final Order.  
      
    | 11.3.  |   | The Escrow Agent will not be liable for any action
taken or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized
or within the rights and powers conferred upon it by this Agreement (other

misconduct), and may consult with outside counsel of its own choice and will
be fully protected for any action taken by it hereunder in good faith and in
accordance with the written opinion of such counsel.  
      
    | 11.4.  |   | Any corporation or association into which the Escrow
Agent may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated,
or any corporation or association to which all or substantially all
the escrow business of such Escrow Agents corporate trust line of business
may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without
further act upon at least 60 days prior written notice to the Acquiror and
the Stockholders Representative; provided that Acquiror shall have the right
within 30 days after receiving any such notice to appoint a different escrow
agent, subject to the consent of the Stockholders Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       | 11.5.  |   | The Escrow Agent may resign by giving written
notice of such resignation to the Acquiror and the Stockholders
Representative specifying a date (not less than 30 days after the giving of
such notice) when such resignation shall take effect; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that such resignation shall not become effective until a
successor escrow agent shall have been appointed and shall have accepted such
appointment in writing and all consideration held in escrow pursuant to this
Agreement has been transferred to such successor escrow agent. Promptly after
such notice, the Acquiror and the Stockholders Representative will, by
mutual agreement, appoint a successor escrow agent, such successor escrow
agent to hold the consideration theretofore deposited with such Escrow Agent
upon the resignation date specified in such notice. If a successor
escrow agent is not appointed within 30 days after written notice
of resignation by the Escrow Agent is received by the Acquiror and
the Stockholders Representative, such Escrow Agent shall have the right to
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a
successor escrow agent.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 11.6.  |   | The Acquiror and the Stockholders Representative may
by mutual agreement at any time substitute a new escrow agent(s) by giving
15 days notice thereof to the Escrow Agent then acting. The Escrow Agent
shall continue to serve until its successor accepts the escrow and receives
delivery of all consideration held in escrow pursuant to this Agreement.  
      
    | 11.7.  |   | The Acquiror, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on
the other hand, shall each (i) pay to the Escrow Agent 50% its service fees
as stated in _Exhibit B_ attached hereto, and (ii) reimburse the Escrow
Agent upon request for 50% of all reasonable expenses, disbursements and
advances, including (1) bank transfer charges and (2) overnight delivery
service charges and (iii) reasonable attorneys fees, incurred or made by it
in connection with carrying out its duties hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall
invoice each of the Acquiror and the Stockholders Representative (with
respect to obligations of the Sellers) separately in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 11.7. In releasing any amounts hereunder to
the Stockholders Representative, the Escrow Agent may deduct therefrom and
pay to itself the amount of any outstanding fees and expenses attributable to
the Sellers payable to it pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. In the
case of each such deduction, a written statement of such deductions and the
basis therefor shall be concurrently delivered to the Acquiror and the
Stockholders Representative.  
      
    | 11.8.  |   | The Acquiror and the Sellers, jointly and severally,

employees for, and to hold them harmless as to any liability, claims,
suits, actions, proceedings (formal and informal),
investigations, judgments, deficiencies, damages, settlements, incurred by it
by reason of, or relating to, it having accepted such appointment or in
carrying out the terms and its duties hereof, other than as incurred by
reason of such Escrow Agents gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | 11.9.  |   | Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, indirect
or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not
limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. The
Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any other party to this Agreement for
losses due to, or if it is unable to perform its obligations under the terms
of this Agreement because of, acts of God, fire, floods, strikes or other
similar causes reasonably beyond its control.  
      
    | 11.10.  |   | The Escrow Agent is authorized to comply with and
obey all laws, orders, judgments, decrees, and regulations of any
governmental authority, court, tribunal, or arbitrator. If the Escrow Agent
so complies, it shall not be liable even if such law, order,
judgment, decree, or regulation is subsequently reversed, modified,
annulled, set aside, vacated, or found to have been entered
without jurisdiction.

Exhibit B 

   

December _ _, 2005 

   

[addressee]  

  

Ladies and Gentlemen,  

  

 We have acted as special counsel to Cyota, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), in connection with the merger (the "Merger") of Powder Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Sub"), with and into the Company, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of December _ _, 2005 (the "Merger Agreement") among the Company, the Sub and RSA Security Inc., a Delaware corporation. This opinion is delivered to you pursuant to Subsection 8.2(k) of the Merger Agreement. Except as otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

   

 For purposes of this opinion, we have examined the following documents: 

   

 (a) The certificate of incorporation of the Company, certified by an officer of the Company to be complete, true and correct and in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Certificate of Incorporation"); 

   

 (b) The Bylaws of the Company, certified by an officer of the Company to be complete, true and correct and in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "By-laws"); 

   

 (c) The Certificate of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), filed with the Delaware Secretary of State on December _ _, 2005; 

   

 (d) An Officers certificate dated as of December _ _, 2005 (the "Officers Certificate"), furnished by an officer of the Company, a copy of which is attached to this Opinion as Exhibit  _A_ ; 

   

 (e) A Good Standing Certificate of the Company issued by the Delaware Secretary of State on December _ _, 2005;

 (f) The written consents approving the Merger Agreement and the Merger of the (i) board of directors of the Company, and (ii) stockholders of the Company, as certified to us by the Secretary of the Company; and 

   

 (g) The Merger Agreement, including the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

   

 Additionally, we have made such examination of laws, of certificates of public officials and of officers of the Company, and corporate records of the Company, as we have deemed necessary to enable us to render the opinions set forth herein. 

   

 We have assumed, with your permission, that the Merger Agreement (a) has been duly authorized by all parties thereto (other than the Company), (b) has been duly executed and delivered by all parties thereto (other than the Company), (c) constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of all parties thereto (other than the Company), enforceable against such parties in accordance with its terms, and (d) was executed in the form reviewed by us. 

   

 For purposes of this opinion, we have not reviewed any court docket or any documents other than the (i) Companys agreements listed on Exhibit "B" hereto (the "Material Agreements") and (ii) documents listed under clauses (a) through (g) above (and the certificates of public officials, of officers of the Company and the corporate records mentioned above) (collectively with the Material Agreements, the "Documents"). In particular, we have not reviewed any document (other than the Documents) that is referred to in, or incorporated by reference into, the Documents. We have expressly assumed that there exists no provision in any document that we have not reviewed that is inconsistent with the opinions stated herein. We have conducted no independent factual investigation of our own, but rather, as to factual matters, have relied solely upon the Documents, the statements and information set forth therein and the additional matters recited or assumed herein, all of which we have assumed to be true, complete and accurate in all material respects. 

   

 We have further assumed, (i) the genuineness of the signatures of persons signing the Merger Agreement on behalf of all parties; (ii) the genuineness of all signatures and the authenticity and completeness of all records, certificates, instruments and documents submitted to us as originals; (iii) the conformity to authentic originals of all records, certificates, instruments and documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, photostatic or facsimile copies thereof; (iv) that the Companys stock ledger and corporate minute books reviewed by us are accurate and complete as of immediately prior to the Closing (the "Corporate Records"), and (v) that the Company records all stock issuance, transfers and retirements in its stock ledger. 

   

 As to matters of fact relevant to the opinions hereinafter expressed, with your permission, we have assumed the accuracy and completeness of, and have relied upon the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement and in the Officers Certificate.   #####

 In expressing opinions based on our knowledge, the phrase "our knowledge" or words of similar meaning means that, in the course of our representation of the Company, no information has come to the attention of partners or associates of this firm who have performed legal services on behalf of the Company that would give them actual knowledge that any such opinions or other matters are not accurate or that any of the documents, certificates, reports and information upon which we have relied are not accurate and complete. Except as otherwise stated herein, we have undertaken no independent investigation or verification of such matters. 

   

 Our opinions expressed in paragraph 4 below, insofar as they relate to (i) the full payment for the outstanding shares of the Companys capital stock, (ii) the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company and (iii) the due and valid issuance of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, are based solely on a review of the Corporate Records as well as the Certificate of Incorporation, the By-laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law. 

   

 Based upon the foregoing and subject to the exceptions, qualifications and limitations herein set forth, we are of the opinion that: 

   

 1\. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with the requisite corporate power and authority to own its properties and to conduct its business as now conducted and as known to us. 

   

 2\. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. 

   

 3\.

 4\. The authorized and outstanding capitalization of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time is as follows: 

   

 (i) _Preferred Stock_. 394,620,000 authorized shares of Preferred Stock, (the "Preferred Stock"), of which (a) 131,400,000 shares are designated Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.002 per share, 130,605,910 of which are issued and outstanding of record immediately prior to the Closing; (b) 131,400,000 shares are designated Series AA Preferred Stock, par value $0.002 per share, none of which are issued and outstanding of record prior to the Effective Time; (c) 65,910,000 shares are designated Series B Preferred Stock, par

designated Series BB Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, none
of which are issued and outstanding of record immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and 

   

 (ii) _Common Stock_. 273,000,000 authorized shares of Common Stock, par value $0.002 per share (the "Common Stock"), 19,752,318 of which are issued and outstanding of record immediately prior to Closing. 

  

 All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are duly authorized, validly issued, nonassessable and, to our knowledge, fully paid. 

   

 5\. _Rights to Acquire Stock_. Except as set forth in Section 4.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or as set forth in or contemplated by the Merger Agreement, to our knowledge, there exist no options, puts, call, contracts, warrants, conversion privileges or other rights (or agreements or commitments for any such rights) outstanding to purchase or otherwise obtain from the Company any of the Companys securities. 

   

 6\. The execution and delivery by the Company of the Merger Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and stockholder action of the Company, and the Merger Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company. The Merger Agreement constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company according to its terms. 

   

 7\. The execution, delivery and performance of the obligations of the Company under the Merger Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby, (i) do not require any consents, approvals, permits, orders or authorizations of, and all qualifications, registrations, designations, declarations or filings with, any Delaware governmental authority or agency on the part of the Company and (ii) do not conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default under, result in the acceleration of, create in any party the right to accelerate, terminate, modify or cancel or requires any notice, consent or waiver (which has not been obtained) under, any Material Agreement. 

   

 8\. Upon the filing by the Surviving Corporation of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, the Merger will be effective under the Delaware General Corporation Law. 

   

 9\. To our knowledge, except as set forth in Section 4.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending against the Company or any Subsidiary before any court or governmental agency, nor, to our knowledge, has the Company or any Subsidiary received any written threat thereof, (i) that seeks either   #####

damages in excess of $ _ _ or equitable relief or (ii) in
any manner challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or delay
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 

   

 Our opinions are further limited, as they relate to enforceability of the agreements referred to therein, by (i) public policy considerations; (ii) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, as well as awards by courts of relief in lieu of the remedy of specific performance of contractual provisions; and (iii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) as a court having jurisdiction may impose. 

   

 No opinion is given as to: 

   

 a. Any provision in the Merger Agreement that purports to: 

   

 1. Define, waive or set standards for good faith, reasonableness, commercial reasonableness, fair dealing, diligence or the like;
