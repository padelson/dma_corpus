connection with the merger (the &#147;Merger&#148;) of Powder Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation

documents listed under clauses (a)&nbsp;through (g)&nbsp;above (and the certificates of public officials, of

expressly assumed that there exists no provision in any document that we have not reviewed that is
inconsistent with the opinions stated herein. We have conducted no independent factual
investigation of our own, but rather, as to factual matters, have relied solely upon the Documents,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have further assumed, (i)&nbsp;the genuineness of the signatures of persons signing the Merger

(iii)&nbsp;the conformity to authentic originals of all records, certificates, instruments and documents

properties and to conduct its business as now conducted and as known to us.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform
its obligations under the Merger Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The execution, delivery and performance of the obligations of the Company under the Merger
Agreement, do not violate (i)&nbsp;any provision of any Delaware state law, rule or regulation, or any
United States Federal law, rule or regulation, known to us to be applicable to the Company (ii)&nbsp;any
judgment, order, writ or decree of any governmental agency or body of the United States Federal
Government or the State of Delaware known to us to be applicable to the Company, or (iii)&nbsp;any
