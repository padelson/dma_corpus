WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
as a condition and inducement to the willingness of the Company to enter into
this Agreement and the Principal Stockholders to enter into the Principal
Stockholders Agreement, Meggitt PLC, a public limited company organized under

representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the " _ _Closing
Date_._"

1.3 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger (the " _ _Delaware
Certificate of Merger__ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the

Corporation, the title to any property or rights of the Company acquired or
to be acquired by reason of, or as a result of, the Merger, the parties agree
that they and their then serving, duly appointed officers and directors shall
and will execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments and
assurances and do all things necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect
or confirm title to such property or rights in the Surviving Corporation and
otherwise to carry out the purpose of this Agreement, and that such officers

C Preferred Share (i) held in the treasury of the Company, (ii) owned by any
Subsidiary of the Company or (iii) owned by Parent or any Subsidiary of

3 (b) _Conversion of Series C Preferred Shares_.

(i) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders of capital stock of the Company or capital stock
of Merger Sub, each Series C Preferred Share issued and outstanding

cancelled pursuant to Section 4.2(a)) shall be converted into the right to
receive, upon surrender of the certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented such Series C Preferred Share in accordance with
Section 4.3, cash in an amount equal to the sum of (A) the Liquidation
Preference (as defined in the Companys Certificate of Designations of Series
C Preferred Stock filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
on September 30, 2004 (as amended or modified from time to time, the " _
_Certificate of Designations__ ")) plus (B) the amount of all accrued and
unpaid dividends on such Series C Preferred Share up to but not including the
Effective Time to the extent not added to the Liquidation Preference pursuant
to Section 2(d) of the Certificate of Designations (whether or not earned or
declared) (such sum, the " _ _Per Series C Preferred Share Consideration__ ").
To the extent requested by Parent (and to the extent sufficient time prior to
the Effective Time exists in order to enable the Company to give such
notice), the Company shall provide at least thirty (30) days notice of
redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock in connection with the Merger to
the holders pursuant to Sections 6(a) and (c) of the Certificate of
Designations.

(ii) Each Series C Preferred Share so converted at the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate which theretofore
represented Series C Preferred Shares so converted and cancelled shall

Shares, except the right to receive the Per Series C Preferred Share
Consideration multiplied by the number of Series C Preferred Shares formerly
represented by such certificate, without interest thereon and subject to
Section 4.3.

(c) _Conversion of Common Shares_.

(i) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on

Merger Sub, each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Common Shares cancelled pursuant to Section 4.2(a)
and Common Shares with respect to which the holder thereof exercises appraisal
rights under Section 262 of the DGCL) shall be converted into the right to
receive cash in an amount equal to $1.08 (the " _ _Per Common Share
Consideration__ "), upon surrender of the certificate which immediately prior

4.3.

 

(ii) Each Common Share so converted at the Effective Time shall be cancelled

Common Shares so converted and cancelled shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such Common Shares, except the right to receive the Per
Common Share Consideration multiplied by the number of Common Shares

(d) _Conversion of Company Options_. Between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the Company shall take all reasonable action necessary
(which action  



 

4  shall be effective as of or prior to the Effective Time), to terminate the
Stock Plans and provide that, at or prior to the Closing, each outstanding
Company Option shall become fully vested, to the extent provided in the
underlying grant, to the extent not already vested. Each holder of a Company
Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time and has an
exercise price per Common Share that is less than the Per Common Share
Consideration shall (subject to the provisions of this Section 4.2(d)) be paid
by the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 4.3(a)), in exchange for the
cancellation of such Company Option and completion of an acknowledgement
letter, an amount in cash (less any applicable withholding Taxes (as defined
in Section 5.1(m)) equal to the product of (i) the difference between the Per
Common Share Consideration (without interest) and the applicable exercise
price per Common Share of such Company Option and (ii) the aggregate number of
Common Shares for which such Company Option is exercisable (the " _ _Option
Payment__ "). The Exchange Agent shall make the Option Payments at or
promptly following the Effective Time and Parent shall provide the Exchange
Agent with the requisite amount of funds to make such Option Payments. Any
such payments shall be net of all applicable federal, state and local
Tax withholding. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such
actions as may be necessary to cause any Company Option that is not exchanged
as provided above to be cancelled as of the Effective Time.

(e) _Merger Sub Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
newly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

4.3 _Exchange of Certificates for Common Shares and Series C Preferred
Shares_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with an
exchange agent in the United States appointed by Parent and approved
in advance by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)
(the " _ _Exchange Agent__ "), to be held in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Common Shares, cash in an amount equal to the product of (A) the
Per Common Share Consideration and (B) the aggregate number of Common Shares
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (such cash, the
" _ _Exchange Fund__ ").

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i)  _Common Shares_. Appropriate transmittal materials, specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to certificates
representing Common Shares (each a " _ _Certificate__ ") shall pass only upon
proper delivery of certificates to the Exchange Agent and to otherwise be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company, shall be provided by the
Exchange Agent to holders of record of Common Shares as soon as practicable
after the Effective Time advising such holders of the effectiveness of the
Merger and the procedure for surrendering Certificates converted into the
right to receive the consideration payable pursuant to Section 4.2(c) to the
Exchange Agent. Upon the surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent, in
accordance with the terms of such transmittal materials, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
consideration payable pursuant to Section  



 

5  4.2(c) for the Common Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, and
such Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon surrender of the Certificates. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Common Shares that is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, the proper amount of cash may be paid in
exchange therefor to a Person other than the Person in whose name a
Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting
such issuance shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
transfer of the Common Shares to, or to payment to, a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.3(b)(i),
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash
such holder shall be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 4.2(c)(i).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.3(b), (x) Parent shall,
as promptly as is reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and in no
event later than 10 Business Days prior to the Closing), deliver to the
Principal Stockholders such transmittal materials as would be required of
holders of Certificates pursuant to the first sentence of this Section
4.3(b)(i) and (y) so long as the Principal Stockholders complete such
transmittal materials and deliver them to Parent at or prior to the Closing
(it being understood and agreed that if Parent shall fail to deliver such
transmittal materials to the Principal Stockholders no later than 10 Business
Days prior to the Closing then in such event such transmittal materials shall
not be required to be completed by the Principal Stockholders), Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to pay to the Principal Stockholders immediately
after the Effective Time, the Per Common Share Consideration payable with
respect of the Common Shares held by the Principal Stockholders upon surrender
of the Certificates representing such Common Shares.

(ii) _Series C Preferred Shares_. Upon the surrender of a certificate
representing Series C Preferred Shares to Parent at or after the
Effective Time, the holder of such certificate shall be entitled to receive
from Parent and Parent shall immediately pay to such holder the Per Series C
Preferred Share Consideration payable pursuant to Section 4.2(b) for the
Series C Preferred Shares formerly represented by such certificate. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 4.3(b)(ii), each certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the amount of cash such holder shall be entitled
to receive pursuant to Section 4.2(b)(i). Parent shall, as promptly as is
reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and in no event later than 10
Business Days prior to the Closing), deliver to each holder of Series C
Preferred Shares such transmittal materials as would be required of holders of
Certificates pursuant to the first sentence of Section 4.3(b)(i) and so long
as such holder of Series C Preferred Shares completes such transmittal
materials and delivers them to Parent at or prior to the Closing (it being
understood and agreed that if Parent shall fail to deliver such transmittal
materials to such holder of Series C Preferred Shares no later than 10
Business Days prior to the Closing then in such event such transmittal
materials shall not be required to be completed by such holder of Series C
Preferred Shares), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay to each holder
of Series C Preferred Shares immediately after the Effective Time, the Per
Series C Preferred Share Consideration payable with respect of the Common
Shares held by such holder of Series C Preferred Shares upon surrender of the
Certificates representing such Common Shares. 



 

6 (c) _Transfers_. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Series C Preferred Shares
and Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(d)  _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion.
Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such
investments shall be payable to Parent.

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Common Shares of the Company for 180 days
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any stockholders of
the Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article IV shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (in the case of holders of
Common Shares) or the Parent (in the case of holders of Series C Preferred
Shares) for payment of any amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.2 upon due
surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof),
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any former holder of Common Shares or Series C
Preferred Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _Person__ " shall mean any
individual, corporation (including not-for-profit), general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, estate, trust,
association, organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section
5.1(d)(i)) or other entity of any kind or nature.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent or the Parent, as the case may be,
will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
consideration that would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Common Shares pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _ _Code__ "), or any provision of Federal, State,
local or foreign tax Law.

4.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any issued and outstanding Common Shares and Series C Preferred
Shares held by a person who shall not have voted to adopt this Agreement or
consented thereto or waived such rights in writing and who properly demands
appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section  



 

7  262 of the DGCL (such person, a " _ _Demanding Stockholder__ "; such shares,
" _ _Appraisal Shares__ ") shall not be converted as described in Sections
4.2(c) or 4.2(b), as applicable, but shall be converted into the right to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Demanding
Stockholder pursuant to the DGCL, unless such holder fails to perfect or
withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal. If, after the Effective
Time, such Demanding Stockholder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his
right to appraisal, such Demanding Stockholders Common Shares and Series
C Preferred Shares shall no longer be considered Appraisal Shares for the
purposes of this Agreement and shall be deemed to have been converted, at the
Effective Time, into the right to receive the consideration set forth in
Sections 4.2(c) or 4.2(b), as applicable, without any interest thereon. The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Common Shares or Series C Preferred Shares,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments or documents served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands.
Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make
any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands
for amounts in excess of the Per Common Share Consideration or the Per
Preferred Share Consideration. Each holder of Appraisal Shares who becomes
entitled to payment for such Appraisal Shares under the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL, will receive payment thereof from the Surviving Corporation
and, as of the Effective Time, such Appraisal Shares will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist.

ARTICLE V

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

5.1 _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company on or prior to the
date hereof (the " _ _Company Disclosure Letter__ "), each section of which
qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation, warranty or covenant
to the extent specified therein and such other representations, warranties or
covenants to the extent the relevance of a matter disclosed in such section of

and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as
a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of
its assets and properties or the conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, qualified or in

other such failures, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below). The Company has made available to Parent a complete and
correct copy of the Companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each as

unincorporated, of which at least a majority of the securities or ownership
interests having by their terms voting power to elect a majority of the board
of directors or other persons performing similar functions is directly or
indirectly owned or controlled by such Person or by one or more of its
respective Subsidiaries, and (ii) " _ _Company Material Adverse Effect__ "
means any occurrence, change or effect that has or would be reasonably
expected to have a material adverse effect on (A) the business, assets,
liabilities, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, but excluding any such occurrence, change

conditions or financial or securities markets in general or the industries and
markets in which the Company conducts its business (except, in each case, if
materially and disproportionately impacting the business, assets, liabilities,
financial condition, or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (2) any change in and of itself in the
Companys stock price or trading volume, (3) any change in Law or GAAP after

Agreement, (5) the announcement of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, any (x) actions by
customers or competitors, (y) loss of personnel or customers, or (z) the delay
or cancellation of orders for services and products but only to the extent
arising from the announcement of the Merger), (6) any outbreak or escalation
of hostilities involving the United States, the declaration by the United
States of a national emergency or war, or the occurrence of any acts of
terrorism, or (7) any actions taken with the prior written consent of Parent,
(B) the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement
or (C) the ability of the Company to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is
understood and agreed that in no event shall any occurrence, change or effect
that arises out of or results from a delay in the placement of an order or

and/or its Subsidiaries and/or a delay in acceptance by customers of a
shipment or shipments from the Company and/or its Subsidiaries of the type
described in Section 5.1(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter be

contemplated thereby, subject only to the adoption of this Agreement by the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Shares (the " _ _Company
Requisite Vote__ ") immediately after the execution and delivery hereof by way
of execution of the Principal Stockholders Consents. Each of this Agreement
and the Principal Stockholders Agreement, is a legally valid and binding
obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles, regardless
of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at Law or in equity

obtained or made by the Company from or with any supranational, national,
state, municipal, local or foreign government, any instrumentality,
subdivision, court, administrative agency or commission thereof or other
governmental authority (" _ _Governmental Entity__ ") in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation
by the Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
except those that the failure to obtain or make would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

As used in this Agreement, (x) " _ _Permit__ " means any license, permit,
franchise or certificate of authority, or any extension, modification,
amendment or waiver of the foregoing, required to be issued by any
Governmental Entity and (y) " _ _Approval__ " means approval, authorization,
consent, novation, qualification or registration, or any
extension, modification, amendment or waiver of any of the foregoing,
required to be obtained from, or any notice, statement or other communication
required to be filed with or delivered to, any Governmental Entity.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A)
a breach or violation of, or a default under, the Company Charter or Company
Bylaws or the comparable charter or organizational documents of any
Subsidiary, (B) subject to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote and
compliance with the requirements described in Section 5.1(d)(i), a violation
of any Law or Order applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or

default under, the acceleration of any obligations or the creation of an
Encumbrance on the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (with or
without notice, lapse of time or both) pursuant to, any agreement, lease,
license, contract, note, mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other obligation
(" _ _Contracts__ ") to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or
otherwise binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the
Companys Permits or Approvals except, in the case of clauses (B) and (C)
above, for any breach, violation, termination, default, acceleration or
creation that, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 5.1(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure
Letter sets forth, a correct and complete list of material Contracts of the
Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to which Approvals are or may be
required prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. No other Contracts require approvals or consents except those the
failure of which to obtain would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The term " _ _knowledge__ " when used in this Agreement with respect to the
Company shall mean the actual knowledge of the Companys Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Financial Officer after making
such inquiry as such officer would typically reasonably make under the
circumstances in the performance of his duties of the Persons listed on
Section 5.1(d)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter to the extent such Person
would typically reasonably be consulted by such officer with respect to the
matter in question.



 

12 (iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound
by any non-competition Contracts or other Contract that purports to limit in
any material respect either the type of business in which the Company or its
Subsidiaries (or, after giving effect to the Merger, the Parent or its
Subsidiaries) may engage or the manner or locations in which any of them may
so engage in any business.

(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements_.

(i) The Company has delivered or made available to the Parent each
registration statement, report, proxy statement or information statement
prepared by it since March 31, 2004, including (i) the Companys Annual

Current Report on Form 8-K filed since June 30, 2004, each in the form

and as amended, the " _ _Company Reports__ "). The Company has filed all
reports, schedules, forms and statements required to be filed by the Company
with the SEC since June 30, 2004. As of their respective dates (or, if
amended, as of the date of such amendment prior to the date hereof), the
Company Reports complied (and any Company Reports filed with the SEC
subsequent to the date hereof will comply) in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder and did not,
and any Company Reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof will
not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including the related
notes and schedules) fairly presents, or will fairly present, the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and
each of the consolidated statements of income, of cash flow and of changes in
financial position included in or incorporated by reference into the Company
Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents, or will
fairly present, the results of operations, cash flows, retained earnings
and changes in financial position, as the case may be, of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments), in each
case in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _
_GAAP__ "), except as may be noted therein, consistently applied during the
periods involved and the applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.

302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" _ _SOX__ ") and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company
Reports, and, to the knowledge of the Company, the statements  



 

13  contained in such certifications are true and correct. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, " _principal executive officer_ " and " _principal
financial officer_ " shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX.
Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries of the Company has
outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding, " _extensions of credit_ " to
directors or executive officers within the meaning of Section 402 of SOX,
except as may have been in existence prior to the application of Section 402
of SOX to the Company.

(iv) Except as set forth in Section 5.1(e)(iv) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company has not received any written notification of a "material
weakness" in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting, and, to
the knowledge of the Company, there is no set of circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to result in a " _material weakness_ " in the internal
controls over financial reporting of the Company. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _material weakness_ " shall have the meaning assigned to
it in the Public Company Accounting Oversight Boards Auditing Standard 2, as
in effect on the date hereof.

(v) Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as
defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC), where the
purpose or effect of such contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure
of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries in the Companys or such Subsidiarys
published financial statements or other Company Reports.

(vi) To the knowledge of the Company, the Company is in material compliance
with the applicable provisions of SOX, the rules and regulations of the
SEC adopted in connection therewith.

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed in Section
5.1(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter, since June 30, 2006, the Company has
conducted its business only in the ordinary course consistent with past
practice, and during such period there has not been:

(i) any change, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts that, individually
or in the aggregate, has had a Company Material Adverse Effect; 

(ii) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or other
distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with respect to any Company

amendment of, any employment, severance or termination agreement with any such

(excluding any disclosure set forth in any risk factor section and/or in any
section relating to forward-looking statements, but including all other
information in such Company Reports (including without limitation the
financial statements contained therein)) filed and publicly available prior
to the date hereof or in the Company Disclosure Letter, to the knowledge of
the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
liabilities (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) except (i)
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business after June 30, 2006,
(ii) liabilities that would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
(iii) liabilities and obligations (other than any such liabilities
or obligations arising from the Companys or its Subsidiaries breach or
default prior to the Effective Time) arising out of Contracts to which the
Company or its Subsidiaries is a party.

(h) _Litigation_. There are no material actions, suits, claims,
investigations, audits, examinations or proceedings, whether civil or
criminal, at Law or in equity, before any Governmental Entity or arbitrator
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any of the Companys directors or officers in
their capacity as such, that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect (collectively, " _ _Actions__ "). Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the Companys knowledge, any
officer, director or employee of the Company or any Subsidiaries, has been

Company under investigation by any Governmental Entity, except, in each case,
(i) as disclosed in the Company Reports filed prior to the date hereof, or
Section 5.1(h) of the Company Disclosure Letter or (ii) as would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.



 

15 (i) _Employee Benefits_.

(i) Each benefit and compensation plan, contract, policy or arrangement
(generally, a " _ _Compensation and Benefit Plan__ ") covering current or

and current or former directors of the Company, including "employee benefit

incorporated by reference in the Company Reports prior to the date hereof.

(v) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate thereof has any obligations to
provide health or other non-pension benefits to retirees or other
former employees under any ERISA Plan, except as required by Section 4980 of
the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA.

Disclosure Letter, and all amendments thereto, have been made available to

registered and has been maintained in good standing with applicable regulatory
authorities and has been approved by any applicable Taxing authority to the
extent such Approval is required.

(vii) Except as set forth on Section 5.1(i)(vii) of the Company Disclosure

personnel, properties or other assets or its business or operations, except
for violations or possible violations that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have all Permits and Approvals that are material to the

contemplated by this Agreement.



 

25 (ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the

material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The term " _ _knowledge__ "
when used in this Agreement with respect to Parent shall mean the actual
knowledge of Philip Green, Terry Timms, Andrew Crowe and Eric Lardiere.

6.2 _Acquisition Proposals_.

(a) The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and
that it shall not authorize or permit its or its Subsidiaries directors,
officers, employees, agents  



 

29  or representatives (including any investment banker, financial advisor,
consultant, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of
its Subsidiaries)(collectively, " _ _Representatives__ "), directly or
indirectly, to solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage the
making of any proposal or offer (including any proposal or offer to
the Companys stockholders) that constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to lead to, a proposal for any tender offer, merger, recapitalization,
reorganization, share exchange, business combination, consolidation,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and a third party, or any purchase by a third party of
more than 10% of the outstanding shares of any class of the Companys capital
stock (other than upon the exercise of Company Options that are outstanding
on the date hereof in accordance with their terms) or any business or assets
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries constituting more than 10% of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than
acquisitions or sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business (any
such proposal or offer, other than in connection with the Merger, whether in a
single transaction or a series of related transactions, being
hereinafter referred to as an " _ _Acquisition Proposal__ "). The Company
further agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that it
shall not authorize or permit its or its Subsidiaries Representatives
to: (i) engage, directly or indirectly, in any discussions or negotiations
with, or provide any confidential information or data to, any Person in
furtherance of or relating to an Acquisition Proposal (and the Company, its
Subsidiaries and all such Persons shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any third parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal); (ii) except to
the extent required to give effect to Section 6.2(c) in connection with the
receipt by the Company of an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal described in
clause (1) or (2) thereof, grant any waiver or release under any
confidentiality agreement, standstill agreement or similar agreement with
respect to Company or any of its Subsidiaries (it being understood and agreed
that receipt by the Company of unsolicited Acquisition Proposals or Superior
Proposals shall not be deemed to be such a waiver or release); or (iii)
execute or enter into any written agreement, letter of intent, acquisition
agreement or similar agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (an "
_ _Acquisition Agreement__ ").

(b) Neither the Company nor its Board of Directors shall approve, recommend or
declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Agreement
(or publicly propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or formally
resolve to approve or authorize, any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Agreement), except in connection with a termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 6.2(e) hereof. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) complying with
its disclosure obligations under applicable Laws or (ii) from taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position not inconsistent herewith with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal by a third party to the extent required by
Rule 14d-9(a) or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act. It is
understood and agreed that (i) any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by
the Board of Directors of the Company to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, or any substantially similar
communication to the stockholders of the Company in each case in connection
with and no later than 10 Business Days after the commencement of a tender
offer or exchange offer, or (ii) any disclosure of factual information
regarding the business, financial condition or results of operations of the
Company or the fact that an Acquisition Proposal has been made, the identity
of the party making such proposal or the terms of such proposal, shall not be
deemed to constitute a breach of the first sentence of this Section 6.2(b). 



 

30 (c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in Section 6.2(a), if no later
than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the 25th calendar day after the date
of execution of this Agreement (the " _ _Initial Proposal Deadline__ "), the
Company receives an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (other than as a
result of its breach of Section 6.2(a)) which (1) constitutes a Superior
Proposal (provided the Board of Directors of the Company so determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial
advisors) or (2) which the Board of Directors of the Company determines prior
to the Initial Proposal Deadline, in good faith after consultation with the
Companys outside legal and financial advisors, could reasonably be expected
to result, after the taking of any of the actions referred to in either of
clause (x) or (y) below, in a Superior Proposal (in either of case (1) or (2),
an " _ _Eligible Acquisition Proposal__ "), the Company may take, or the
Company may direct its Representatives to take, the following actions prior
to the later of the Final Change Deadline (as hereinafter defined), or, if
applicable, the Superior Proposal Termination Date (as hereinafter defined),
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal: (x) furnish nonpublic information
to the third party making such Acquisition Proposal, if, and only if, (i) all
such information provided to such third party and its Representatives has
previously been made available to Parent or is made available to Parent
substantially concurrently (and in any event within 24 hours) with the time
such information is provided to such third party and (ii) prior to so
furnishing such information, the Company receives from the third party
an executed confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar, with
respect to confidentiality, to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and
(y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party and its
Representatives with respect to the Acquisition Proposal. " _ _Superior
Proposal__ " shall mean any unsolicited written bona fide proposal to
consummate an Acquisition Proposal made by a third party (which third party
shall have made an Eligible Acquisition Proposal prior to the Initial
Proposal Deadline), which did not result from a knowing or material (whether
or not knowing) breach of Section 6.2(a), on terms which the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) to be more favorable from a
financial point of view (from the perspective of the Companys stockholders)
than the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, taking into account
(i) any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of the transactions contemplated
hereby or this Agreement and (ii) all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company deems
relevant, and is reasonably capable of being consummated by the proposing
third party.

(d) From and after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
promptly, and in any event within 48 hours following receipt thereof, advise
Parent in writing of the receipt, directly or indirectly, of any Acquisition
Proposal (including any materially modified proposal) and any determination
by the Board of Directors of the Company under Section 6.2(c) and 6.2(e),
which notification shall identify the offeror and include a copy of any such
proposal (if such proposal is in writing) or shall summarize the material
terms thereof (if such proposal is not in writing). In addition, the Company
shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably prompt basis with respect to any
changes in material terms or conditions of such proposal.



 

31 (e) The Company may terminate this Agreement (and promptly thereafter (and in
any event within 24 hours) enter into an agreement providing for a Superior
Proposal) prior to the Superior Proposal Termination Date if: (i) the Company
has received such Superior Proposal from a third party prior to the Final
Change Deadline (it being understood and agreed that if the Company receives
a revised proposal from such third party after the Response Period but prior
to the Superior Proposal Termination Date, and such revised proposal is deemed
by the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) at such time to be a
Superior Proposal, then this clause (i) shall be deemed satisfied even though
such revised proposal that is a Superior Proposal was received after the
Final Change Deadline); (ii) the Company shall have provided written notice to
Parent that the Company has determined to accept such Superior Proposal
(which, in the case of the first Superior Proposal Notice hereunder, must be
provided prior to the Final Change Deadline), which notice shall specify all
the terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (the " _ _Superior Proposal
Notice__ "); (iii) Parent shall have been given until 11:59 p.m., New York
City time, on the fifth calendar day after the date the Company delivers the
Superior Proposal Notice to Parent (the " _ _Response Period__ ") to submit an
amended written proposal or to make a new written proposal (such amended
proposal or new proposal, a " _ _New Proposal__ ") to the Company; (iv) at
the end of the Response Period, and taking into account any New Proposal, if
any, that is made by Parent, the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors) that such New
Proposal is not at least as favorable to the Stockholders of the Company as
such Superior Proposal (such determination, an " _ _Adverse Determination__ ")
(it being understood that any New Proposal shall not be required to extend
the Initial Proposal Deadline, Final Change Deadline or Superior Proposal
Termination Date, or eliminate the "matching rights" set forth herein); (v)
the Company is in compliance in all material respects with Section 6.2; and
(vi) the Company has paid or pays concurrently with such termination the
Break-Up Fee. During the Response Period, the Company and its Representatives
shall consider in good faith any adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement that are proposed by Parent in response to a Superior Proposal
Notice.

(f) As used herein, the term:

(i) " _ _Final Change Deadline__ " shall mean the later of (x) the
Initial Proposal Deadline and (y) 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the 15th
calendar day following the last date prior to (which "last date" may be the
day of) the Initial Proposal Deadline on which a third party making an
Eligible Acquisition Proposal (which was made prior to the Initial Proposal
Deadline) has made its first Acquisition Proposal, which is received by the
Company following the execution hereof and prior to the Initial Proposal
Deadline; and

(ii) " _ _Superior Proposal Termination Date__ " shall mean the later of (a)
the Final Change Deadline and (b) 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the 10th
calendar day following the date on which the Company first delivers a Superior
Proposal Notice to Parent in accordance herewith prior to the Final Change
Deadline; _provided_ , _however_ in no event shall the Superior Proposal
Termination Date be later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the 45th
calendar date after the date of this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if the then pending Response Period shall expire at or after the time of
the Superior Proposal Termination Date and during such Response Period (x)
Parent does not make a New Proposal or (y) Parent shall have made a New
Proposal but the Board of Directors of the Company shall have made an
Adverse  



 

32  Determination with respect to such New Proposal that related to such
Response Period, then the Superior Proposal Termination Date shall be extended
to the time that is 90 minutes after the end of such Response Period (and,
for the avoidance of doubt, during such 90 minute period the Company shall be
permitted to terminate this Agreement and enter into an agreement providing
for such Superior Proposal promptly (within 3 hours after the end of such 90
minute period) after such termination).

6.3 _Information Supplied_.

(a) The Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of
this Agreement, prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary
information statement (the " _ _Preliminary Information Statement__ "). The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any
comments of the SEC on the Preliminary Information Statement. The Company
shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Preliminary Information Statement or for additional
information and shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its
staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Preliminary Information
Statement. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to prepare and file with the SEC the final, definitive information statement
(the " _ _Final Information Statement__ ") and to cause the Final Information
Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders of the Company
as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (the date of
such mailing is hereafter referred to as the " _ _Mailing Date__ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Preliminary or
Final Information Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to the comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i)
shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response and (ii) shall reasonably consider including in such
document or response all reasonable comments proposed by Parent.

(b) Each of Parent and the Company agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries,
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Final
Information Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, as of the
Mailing Date, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the effective date of the
Principal Stockholders Consent, there shall occur any event with respect to
Company, Parent or any of their Subsidiaries, or with respect to
any information provided by Company or Parent for inclusion in the Final
Information Statement, which event is required to be described in an amendment
or supplement to the Information Statement, such amendment or supplement shall
be promptly filed with the SEC, as required by applicable Law, and
disseminated to the holders of the Companys Common Shares, as applicable.
Parent and the Company will cause the Final Information Statement to comply as
to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.



 

33 6.4 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

(a) The Company and Parent shall (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to) cooperate with each other and take or cause to be taken all
actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate

Agreement as soon as practicable, including using their best efforts to

concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with the Information Statement or any other registration, declaration, filing,
notice or report made by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
respective Subsidiaries to any third party, including any Governmental
Entity, in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(c) Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental Entity,
the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other
communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any
of its Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity with respect to such
transactions. 

(d) Without limitation of the foregoing, Parent and the Company undertake and
agree to file as soon as practicable (and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days after the date hereof), if required by law, a Notification and
Report Form under the HSR Act with the Federal Trade Commission (" _ _FTC__ ")
and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (" _ _DOJ__ "). If
Parent or the Company reasonably determine that it is so required, Parent and
Company shall, promptly after the date of this Agreement, prepare and file
notifications required under any applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws or
regulations thereunder in connection with the Merger.

(e) Without limitation of the above, Parent and the Company undertake and
agree to file as soon as practicable (and in any event within fifteen (15)

Exon-Florio Amendment, with respect to the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement. The parties agree to provide CFIUS with any additional or
supplemental information requested by CFIUS or its member agencies during
the Exon-Florio Amendment review process. The parties, in cooperation with
each other, shall take all commercially reasonable steps advisable, necessary
or desirable to finally and successfully complete the Exon-Florio Amendment

agree to file (i) as soon as practicable (and in any event within fifteen
(15) Business Days after the date hereof) with the United States Department of
State Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (" _ _DDTC__ ") the requisite
notifications under ITAR and (ii) within five (5) Business Days after the
date hereof with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (the
" _ _ATF__ ") a notice in connection with the Companys application to renew
its license to be a manufacturer of destructive devices and certain other
materials, which expires on September 1, 2006, referencing this Agreement
pursuant to which Parent will acquire the Company, and cooperate with any
requests or directions of ATF regarding the filing of related or supplemental
materials.

(g) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to
this Section 6.4 (but subject to the limitations provided in clause (ii)
below with respect to Specified Efforts), each of the Company and Parent
agrees to take or cause to be taken the following actions: (i) cooperate in
all respects with each other in connection with any request by any
Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of any antitrust or
competition Laws applicable to the Company or Parent (" _ _Government
Antitrust Entity__ ") for additional non-privileged information and documents
requested by such Government Antitrust Entity or that are necessary, proper or
advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) the prompt use of its Specified Efforts to avoid the entry
of any Order that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes
of this Section 6.4(g), " _ _Specified Efforts__ " shall mean all efforts
that an acquiring or selling entity (as the case may be) in an acquisition
such as the one contemplated herein would make if using best efforts to avoid
the entry of such an Order, including the devotion of all required management
time and the engagement and payment of its Representatives to assist in such
efforts but otherwise excluding the payment of any sum material to Parents
acquisition of the Company to avoid the entry of such Order. 

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither Parent
nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to make proposals,
execute or carry out agreements or submit to orders (i) providing for the sale
or other disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust
or otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets of Parent or any of its
Affiliates, or seeking to impose any material limitation on the ability of
Parent or any of its Affiliates to conduct their business or own such assets
or (ii) providing for the sale or other disposition or holding separate
(through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or
categories of assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or seeking to impose
any material limitation on the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to
conduct the business or own such assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
except in the case of this clause (ii) for any such sale or disposition of
assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any such material limitation as
would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. For the avoidance of doubt,
the term "Affiliates" in this paragraph refers to Affiliates of Parent prior
to the Effective Time.

6.5 _Access_. Except as may otherwise be required by applicable Law, upon
reasonable notice, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
afford Parents directors, officers, employees, counsel, agents, accountants
and other authorized representatives (" _ _Representatives__ ") reasonable
access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the
Effective Time, to its properties, books, contracts and records and, during
such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish
promptly to Parent all information  



 

35  concerning its business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be
requested; _provided,_ that no investigation pursuant to this Section
6.5 shall amend or modify any representations or warranties made herein or
the conditions to the obligations of the respective parties to consummate the
Merger; and _provided_ , _further_ that the foregoing shall not require the
Company to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the
good faith judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of third Persons or violate any of its or its Subsidiaries
obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used
its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third
Persons to such inspection or disclosure. All requests for information made
pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be directed to an executive officer of the
Company or such Person as may be designated in writing by an executive officer
of the Company. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

6.6 _Publicity_. Parent and the Company agree that no public release or
announcement shall be made without the prior written consent of the
other party or parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant
to any listing agreement with or rules of any applicable U.S. or non-U.S.
securities exchange or interdealer quotation service, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall use reasonable efforts to
allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance.

6.7 _Employee Compensation and Benefits_.

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof (the " _ _Benefits Continuation Period__ "), Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each person who,
as of the Effective Time, is an employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of
the Company for so long as such employee continues to be employed by the
Company (a " _ _Company Employee__ ") with compensation (including bonus
opportunities) and employee benefits that, in Parents judgment, are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than the granting of
Company Options and any "change in control" benefits. Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all employee benefit obligations to
Company Employees under the employee severance plans or policies in existence
on the date hereof and disclosed on Section 6.7(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter and all employment or severance agreements entered into by the Company
or adopted by the Companys Board of Directors prior to the date hereof and
disclosed on Section 6.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. However, payment
of any "deferred compensation" to a "specified employee" (in each case,
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the published guidance
thereunder) may be postponed until six months after the Effective Time solely
to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of tax under Section 409A of
the Code. Nothing contained herein shall be interpreted to obligate Parent or
the Surviving Corporation to continue to employ any current employee.

(b) Following the Effective Time and with respect to any benefit plans or
programs provided to the Company Employees, (i) service accrued by Company
Employees during employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time shall be  



 

36  recognized for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual
(provided that no duplication of benefits or benefit accruals would result
from such crediting), (ii) in the case of Employee Welfare Benefit Plans (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) any and all pre-existing condition
limitations (to the extent such limitations did not apply to a pre-existing
condition under the applicable Compensation and Benefit Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time) and eligibility waiting periods under any group
health plan shall be waived with respect to such Company Employees and their
eligible dependents and (iii) in the case of Employee Welfare Benefit Plans
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) the Company Employees shall be given
credit for amounts paid under a Compensation and Benefit Plan prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the employee welfare plans maintained by Parent or the
applicable Subsidiary of Parent.

6.8 _Expenses_. Subject to Section 8.5, from and after the Effective Time the

38  of the disclosure in the Company Disclosure Letter of any Supplementary
Disclosed Matters (i) shall only be considered for purposes of the condition

prior to the Closing shall result in withholding tax under Section 1445 of the
Code.
