affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, alone or in concert with other Persons: (i)&nbsp;make, or in
any way participate in, any &#147;solicitation&#148; of &#147;proxies&#148; (as such terms are used in the proxy rules
of the SEC) with respect to Partners Common Units, or advise or seek to influence any Person with
respect to the voting of, or giving of consents with respect to, any Partners Common Units, or
form, join, or in any way participate in, a &#147;group&#148; (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;13(d)(3) of the
Exchange Act) with respect to the Partners Common Units, (ii)&nbsp;acquire or offer or agree to acquire,

and trading activities in the ordinary course up to aggregate ownership of 4.99% of the outstanding
Partners Common Units directly or derivatively, including through options, warrants, convertible
securities, unit appreciation rights or other rights, short interests, rights to distributions, or
performance related payments described in clauses (b)&nbsp;through (e)&nbsp;and shall have the right to vote
such securities, in each case so long as such Proposing Party shall not have used any confidential
information in connection therewith in violation of the Confidentiality Agreement), (iii)&nbsp;otherwise
seek to influence or control, in any manner whatsoever, the management or policies of Partners
(other than in connection with a potential acquisition of Holdings), (iv)&nbsp;assist, advise or
