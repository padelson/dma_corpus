(and which is not subject to adjustment for the Wisconsin Debt) (the

Date by the Sellers delivering to the Buyers such assignments and other
instruments and documents as shall be effective to vest in the Buyers, on the
Closing Date, good and marketable title to the Acquired Interests, subject,
in each case, to no Liens other than such as may be created by or on behalf

Agreement shall take place at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP,
425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017 at 10:00 a.m. on the third

Closing Determination. (a) Within 90 calendar days after the Closing Date,
the Buyers shall deliver to the Sellers a statement of the Net Working
Capital (the "Closing Working Capital Statement"). During the preparation of
the Closing Working Capital Statement by the Buyers and the period of any
dispute with respect to the application of this Section 2.3, the Sellers
shall cooperate with the Buyers to the extent reasonably requested by the
Buyers to prepare the Closing Working Capital Statement or to investigate the
basis for any dispute. The Closing Working Capital Statement shall
be examined by the Sellers, and the Sellers shall, not later than 60
calendar days after receipt of the Closing Working Capital Statement, render
a report thereon (the "Closing Working Capital Report"). During the
preparation of the Closing Working Capital Report and the period of any
dispute with respect thereto, the Buyers shall: provide the Sellers with
reasonable access during normal business hours to the books, records
(including work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents) and
employees of the Subject Companies. The    11    Closing Working
Capital Report shall list those items, if any, from the Closing Working
Capital Statement to which the Sellers take exception and explain the
Sellers\' proposed adjustment. If the Sellers fail to deliver to the Buyers a
Closing Working Capital Report within 60 calendar days following receipt of
the Closing Working Capital Statement, the Sellers shall be deemed to have
accepted the Closing Working Capital Statement for the purposes of
any adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 2.4. If the Buyers do not
give the Sellers notice, within 60 calendar days following receipt of the
Closing Working Capital Report, of objections to the Closing Working Capital
Report, the Buyers shall be deemed to have accepted the determination of the
Net Working Capital as determined by the Sellers in the Closing Working
Capital Report for the purposes of any adjustment to the Purchase Price under
Section 2.4. If the Buyers give the Sellers notice of objections to the
Closing Working Capital Report, and if the Sellers and the Buyers are unable,
within 15 calendar days after receipt by the Sellers of the notice from the
Buyers of such objections, to resolve the disputed exceptions, such disputed
exceptions will be referred to Deloitte and Touche LLP or another firm of
independent certified public accountants ("Independent Accounting Firm")
mutually acceptable to the Sellers and the Buyers. The Buyers and the Sellers
shall cooperate with the Independent Accounting Firm to the extent
reasonably requested by the Independent Accounting Firm to prepare a written
report. The Independent Accounting Firm shall, within 60 calendar days
following its selection, deliver to the Sellers and the Buyers a written
report determining such disputed exceptions, and its determinations will be
conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto for the purposes of any
adjustment to the Purchase Price under Section 2.4. The fees and
disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm acting under this Section
2.3 shall be shared equally by the Buyers and the Sellers.   (b) The Buyers
agree that following the Closing they will not take any action, and the
Sellers agree that prior to the Closing they will not take any action, with
respect to the accounting, books, records, policies and procedures of any
Subject Company that would obstruct or prevent the preparation of the Closing
Working Capital Statement, the Closing Working Capital Report or the report
of the Independent Accounting Firm as provided in this Section 2.3.  
SECTION 2.4 Post-Closing Adjustment.   (i) If the Net Working Capital is
less than $0.00 (zero dollars), the Sellers shall, within three calendar days
following the final determination, pursuant to Section 2.3, of the Net
Working Capital, and based upon such final determination, pay to the Buyers
an amount equal to such deficiency.   (ii) If the Net Working Capital is
more than the $0.00 (zero dollars), the Buyers shall, within three calendar
days following the final determination, pursuant to Section 2.3, of the Net
Working Capital, and based upon such final determination, pay to the Sellers
an amount equal to such excess.   (iii) Any payment to the Buyers under
this Section 2.4 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such account as the Buyers shall designate in writing to the
Sellers. Any payment to the Sellers under this Section 2.4 shall be made in
the manner set forth in Section 2.1.     12     SECTION 2.5 Net
Working Capital. For purposes of this Article 2, "Net Working Capital" means
the amount equal to the current assets, less the current liabilities
(including any Indebtedness other than the Wisconsin Debt and including any
amounts payable under the Severance Plans with respect to any employees
identified to the Sellers by the Buyers prior to the 15th day following the
Closing Date), of the Subject Companies (on a consolidated basis) each
determined (i) as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date, and (ii) in accordance with the accounting principles,
procedures, policies and methods employed by RMC in preparing RMC\'s and the

set forth on Schedule 2.5 and consistent with the accounting principles,
procedures, policies and methods used in preparing the Financial Statements;
provided, however, that current assets and current liabilities shall exclude
any amounts related to Income Taxes.   SECTION 2.6 Excluded Liabilities.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) any

limited liability company or limited partnership, as the case may be, duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the state
in which it is organized and has all requisite power and authority to own or
lease its properties and assets and to conduct its business as now conducted,
except where the failure to be in good standing would not, individually or in
the aggregate, either (i) have or reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business, operations, assets or condition (financial or
otherwise), results of operations or prospects of the Subject Companies taken
as a whole or (ii) materially impair the ability of the Sellers to perform
any of their obligations under this Agreement (either of such effects, a
"Material Adverse Effect").   (b) Copies of the Certificate of Incorporation
and By-laws, partnership agreements, limited liability company agreements and
certificates of formation (or comparable organizational documents, as
applicable) of the Acquired Entities, with all amendments thereto to the date
hereof, have been furnished to the Buyers or their representatives, and such
copies are accurate and complete.   SECTION 3.2 Qualification to Do
Business. Each of the Acquired Entities is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign entity and is in good standing in every jurisdiction in which the
character of the properties and    13   assets owned or leased by it or
the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.3 No Conflict or Violation;
Authority and Validity. (a) The execution, delivery and performance by the
Sellers of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby do not and
will not (i) violate or conflict with any provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws (or comparable organizational documents, as

them are bound or to which any of their respective properties or assets is

or give rise to a right thereunder to require any payment to be made by any
of the Subject Companies, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
upon any of the assets, properties or rights of any of the Subject
Companies.   (b) The Sellers each have the requisite authority to enter into
this Agreement, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to
carry out their respective obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the performance by the Sellers of their respective

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Sellers and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Buyers, this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
each of the Sellers, enforceable against each of the Sellers in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws now
or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting creditors\' rights generally
and subject to the limitations imposed by general equitable principles
(regardless whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law
or in equity).   SECTION 3.4 Consents and Approvals. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.4, to the knowledge of the Sellers neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Sellers nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby by the Sellers require any consent, waiver,
approval, license, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Person, except for any consents or waivers (i) required to be
obtained from the Surface Transportation Board (the "STB") and (ii) the
failure of which to obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.5

Entity, and no Acquired Entity is subject to any obligation (contingent or
otherwise) to repurchase or otherwise acquire or retire, or to register under

interests, as the case may be, beneficially owned by such Acquired Entity of
each such Included Subsidiary are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and were not issued in violation of any preemptive rights,
rights of first refusal or any similar rights. All of the shares shown in
Schedule 3.7(a) as being beneficially owned by an Acquired Entity are owned
by such Acquired Entity either directly or indirectly through other Included
Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens, except as set forth in Schedule

as the case may be.    15    (b) Each of the Included Subsidiaries is a
corporation, limited liability company or partnership, as the case may be,
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
state in which it is organized and has all requisite power and authority to

comparable organizational documents, as applicable) of each of the Included
Subsidiaries, with all amendments thereto to the date hereof, have been
furnished to the Buyer or its representatives, and such copies are accurate
and complete. Each of the Included Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do

except where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 3.8 Financial Statements. The Seller has

provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes

adverse effect upon such Subject Company\'s ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information.   SECTION 3.9 Absence of

[Tax Matters] or 3.25 [Brokers]) with respect to any representation or
warranty unless and until the aggregate amount to which all Buyer Indemnitees
are entitled by reason of all such claims under Section 7.2(a)(i) and
7.2(a)(ii) exceeds $1,000,000 (the "Basket Amount"), in which case the party

Amount and the amount in excess of the Basket Amount.   (b) Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the maximum aggregate liability of the

Seller Indemnitee shall at any time or from time to time suffer any Losses
arising out of or resulting from, or shall pay or become obliged to pay any
sum on account of, one or more of the following:    35     (a) any
untruth or inaccuracy in any representation or certification of such Buyer or
the breach of any warranty of such Buyer contained in this Agreement or in
any certificate delivered to the Sellers in connection with the Closing;  
(b) any failure of such Buyer duly to perform or observe any term, provision,
covenant, agreement or condition contained in this Agreement on the part of
such Buyer to be performed or observed;   (c) any and all Taxes of the
Subject Companies for the Post-Closing Tax Period;   (d) any and all Post-
Closing FELA Claims;   (e) any and all Post-Closing Litigation;  provided,
however, that such Buyer shall have no obligation to make any payment under
Section 7.3(a) (except pursuant to an inaccuracy of a representation or a
breach of a warranty contained in Section 4.6 [Brokers]) with respect to any
representation or warranty unless and until the aggregate amount to which all
Seller Indemnitees are entitled by reason of all such claims under Section
7.3(a) exceeds the Basket Amount, in which case the party entitled to such
indemnification shall be entitled to receive both the Basket Amount and the
amount in excess of the Basket Amount.  Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the maximum aggregate liability of the Buyers to the Seller
Indemnitees under Section 7.3(a) (except pursuant to an inaccuracy of a
representation or a breach of a warranty contained in Section 4.6 [Brokers])
shall not exceed $25,000,000.  For purposes of Section 7.3, whenever it is
necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Subject Companies which
are for a taxable period ending on a day other than the Closing Date, Taxes
imposed on a periodic basis (such as real, personal and intangible property
Taxes) shall be prorated between the Buyers and the Sellers as of the
Closing   SECTION 7.4 Procedures Relating to Third-Party Claims (other
than Tax Claims). (a) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to
any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising
out of or involving a claim made by any Person (other than a party hereto)
against the Indemnified Party (a "Third-Party Claim") (other than a Tax
Claim, the procedures for which shall be governed by Section 11.3), such
Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party in writing, and in
reasonable detail, of the Third-Party Claim within ten (10) Business Days
after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third-Party
Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure (except that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
expenses incurred during the period in which the Indemnified Party
unreasonably failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Indemnified
Party\'s receipt thereof, copies of all material and non-privileged notices
and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party
relating to the Third-Party Claim.    36     If a Third-Party Claim is
made against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to
participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the
defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed
by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party
shall control such defense. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for
any period during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense
thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnified Party shall
have failed to give notice of the Third-Party Claim as provided above). If
the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third-Party Claim,
all the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying
Party\'s request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and
making employees available to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to
defend or prosecute any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will agree
to any settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third-Party Claim which
the Indemnifying Party may recommend and which by its terms obligates the
Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Third-Party Claim relating to matters for which the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification hereunder and involves no admission in respect of
or action on the part of the Indemnified Party. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying
Party\'s prior written consent.   SECTION 7.5 Exclusive Remedy;
Mitigation.   (a) Each of the Sellers and the Buyers and their
respective affiliates hereby acknowledges and agrees that its sole and
exclusive remedy with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to or
in connection with this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article 7. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein will limit any claim based on fraud.   (b) The Sellers and
the Buyers shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate all claims for
indemnification upon and after becoming aware of any event which would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any claim that is indemnifiable
hereunder.   (c) The Buyers and their Affiliates waive any right to
recover punitive, special, exemplary and, except pursuant to Section
7.2(a)(i), incidental and/or consequential damages pursuant to this Article
7.    37     ARTICLE 8. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO PERFORMANCE BY THE

cause to be prepared and duly and timely file or cause to be filed when due
(taking into account all extensions properly obtained), all Tax Returns with
the appropriate taxing authorities relating to the Subject Companies for all
taxable periods beginning after the Closing Date and shall pay all Taxes due
with respect to such Tax Returns. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
the Sellers shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction or credit or
other tax item for such periods on their Tax Returns in a manner consistent
with the Schedule K-1 furnished by the Subject Companies to the Sellers for
such period.   SECTION 11.2 Tax Cooperation. The Buyers and the Sellers
shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
(including the Subject Companies), officers, employees, agents, auditors
and representatives to reasonably cooperate (including by maintaining and
making available to each other all relevant records), in preparing and filing
all Tax Returns and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to
Taxes of the Subject Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and for any
Post-Closing Tax Period.   SECTION 11.3 Procedures Relating to
Indemnification of Tax Claims.   (a) If a claim shall be made by any Tax
authority which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment to any
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 7.2 or 7.3 hereof, the Indemnified
Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party promptly of such claim (a "Tax
Claim"); provided, however,    41    the failure to give notice shall
not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party has been materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure.   (b) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period, the Sellers shall have the right, at their own expense, to
control all proceedings and may make all decisions taken in connection with
such Tax Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall not settle
such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the Buyers, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, and Buyers shall have the right to
participate fully in all aspects of the prosecution or defense of such Tax
Claim if they reasonably determine that such Tax Claim could have a material
adverse impact on the Taxes of the Subject Companies in a taxable period or
portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date. The Buyers and the Subject
Companies shall cooperate with the Sellers in contesting any Tax Claim under
this Section 11.3(b), which cooperation shall include the retention and, upon
request of the Sellers, the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim and making employees available to
provide additional information or explanation of any material provided
hereunder.   (c) The party bearing the liability or obligation to
indemnify for any Taxes described under Sections 7.2 and 7.3 hereof shall be
entitled to any refunds or credits of such Taxes. The Buyers shall cause the
Subject Companies to promptly forward to the Sellers, or after a Buyer\'s
receipt reimburse the Sellers, for any refunds or credits due the Sellers
(pursuant to the terms of this Section 11.3(c)) and the Sellers shall
promptly forward to the Subject Companies or after a Seller\'s receipt
reimburse the Subject Companies, for any refunds or credits due the Buyers
(pursuant to the terms of this Section 11.3(c)).   SECTION 11.4 Transfer
Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration and similar Taxes
(including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes and stock transfer
Taxes) and related fees (including any penalties, interest and additions to
Tax) incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be borne by the Sellers, and the Sellers and the Buyers shall cooperate in
timely preparing and filing all Tax Returns as may be required to comply with
the provisions of such Tax Laws. For the avoidance of doubt, and
notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Sellers shall be responsible
for Income Taxes from the transactions contemplated hereby.   SECTION 11.5
Tax Treatment. Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement
shall be treated by the parties, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
as a Purchase Price adjustment, unless determined otherwise in a final
determination as defined in Section 1313 of the Code.   SECTION 11.6
Coordination with Article 7. In the event the provisions of this Article 11
and the provisions of Article 7 hereof conflict or otherwise each apply by
their terms, this Article 11 shall exclusively govern all matters concerning
Taxes; provided that Sections 11.3, 11.4 and 11.5 of this Article 11 shall
apply in any event.   SECTION 11.7 Section 754 Elections. The Sellers agree
that they will cause each of RPLP, the Railroad LPs and the Railroad LLCs
(the "Section 754 Entities") to make elections under Section 754 of the Code
for the taxable    42      year including the Closing Date to adjust
the basis of each of the properties and assets of such Section 754 Entities
to account for the transfer of the Sellers\' direct and indirect interests in
the Section 754 Entities to the Buyers for federal and, to the extent
applicable, state and local income tax purposes.   SECTION 11.8 Railroad
Tax Credit. The Railroad Track Maintenance credit under Section 45G of the
Code for the tax year ending December 31, 2005 will be taken into account by
the Buyers and Sellers, on a pro rata basis based on the number of days
during such period that the miles of railroad track were owned by the
respective parties hereto. For the tax years ending as of the date of this
transaction for the Acquired Entities, the Sellers intend to claim the credit
on qualified expenditures made through the Closing Date and use railroad
track miles as of such date in computing the limitation. Buyers and Sellers
agree to cooperate to comply with the requirements for claiming the credit
under Section 45G should the IRS issue any form of guidance requiring the
credit, miles used for limitation, or any other restrictions whereby both
parties cannot claim all miles on their respective tax returns. Buyers and
Sellers intend to allow Sellers to claim an appropriate number of railroad
track miles to claim the tax credit on all qualified expenditures made by
Sellers through the Closing Date.   ARTICLE 12. MISCELLANEOUS.   SECTION
12.1 Successors and Assigns. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
no party hereto shall assign this Agreement or any rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party hereto and any
such attempted assignment without such prior written consent shall be void

rights hereunder to any wholly owned direct or indirect affiliate of CandW;)

proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum.   SECTION 12.3 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
