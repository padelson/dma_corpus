provided in the applicable provisions of _Article 7_.

 

(b) _Repayment of Specified Indebtedness_. At the Closing, Encore shall
deliver, for the payoff of the Specified Indebtedness, (i) an amount equal to
the payoff amount specified in each of the payoff letters delivered pursuant
to _Section 2.6(b)(vi)_ by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the creditors account specified therein and (ii) an amount equal to the
aggregate of

 



9  the "ReTax Closing Payment" and the "Security Deposit" specified in the
Acknowledgement and Release Agreement delivered pursuant to _Section
2.6(b)(xv)_ by wire transfer of immediately available funds to ReTax
Fundings account specified to Encore prior to the Closing (such amounts in
clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the " _Debt Repayment_ "). In the event
that such "ReTax Closing Payment" is less than the amount of the ReTax
Funding Obligation that may ultimately be determined to be due and payable to
ReTax Funding, McCombs and JHBC shall be solely responsible for any obligation
to pay the difference to ReTax Funding (and in the event that such "ReTax
Closing Payment" is greater than the amount of the ReTax Funding Obligation
that may ultimately be determined to be due and payable to ReTax Funding,
McCombs and JHBC shall be entitled to receive any and all refund or
adjustment payments from ReTax Funding).

(c) _Estimated Closing Purchase Price_. At the Closing, Encore shall deliver
an amount equal to the difference between the Estimated Purchase Price (as
determined in accordance with _Section 2.4(a)_) and the Holdback (such
difference, the " _Estimated Closing Purchase Price_ "), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, to such account or accounts as the Seller
Representative may designate for disbursement to the Sellers. Encore shall
have no liability for the payment by the Seller Representative, or the
allocation among the Sellers, of the Estimated Closing Purchase Price or any
other element of Purchase Price that the Sellers may be entitled to receive.

 

2.4 _Estimation and Reconciliation of the Purchase Price_.

 

(a) _Estimated Purchase Price_. Prior to the Closing, the Seller
Representative delivered to Encore a statement (the " _Estimated Statement_
"), attached as _Schedule V_ , setting forth the Seller Representatives good
faith estimate of the Purchase Price (the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ ") and
providing reasonable detail and documentary support for each amount
calculated pursuant to clauses (b) through (h) of _Section 2.2_. The
Estimated Purchase Price was determined by the Seller Representative in
accordance with GAAP consistent with the Acquired Companies past accounting
practices. The amount of the Estimated Purchase Price set forth on the
Estimated Statement, as reviewed and approved by Encore, shall be used to
determine the Estimated Closing Purchase Price payable at the Closing
pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_.

(b) _Post-Closing Reconciliation_. Within one hundred twenty (120) days after
the Effective Time, Encore shall prepare and deliver to the Seller
Representative a statement (the " _Reconciliation Statement_ ") setting forth
Encores determination of the actual amount of the Purchase Price (the "
_Reconciled Purchase Price_ ") and providing reasonable detail and documentary
support for each amount calculated pursuant to clauses (b) through (h) of 
_Section 2.2_. The Reconciled Purchase Price shall be determined in
accordance with GAAP consistent with the Acquired Companies past accounting
practices. The Seller Representative may object to the Reconciliation
Statement within thirty (30) days after its receipt thereof by delivering to
Encore a response to the Reconciliation Statement setting forth each
calculation (and element thereof) that is disputed by the Seller
Representative, and the Seller Representatives good faith determination of
the correct amount of each such calculation and element. The Seller
Representative will provide reasonable detail with respect to the nature of
its dispute with each disputed calculation and element and the manner of its
determination of the amount(s) thereof.

(c) _Final Determination of Purchase Price_.

(i) If the Seller Representative does not deliver an objection to
the Reconciliation Statement within the thirty-day period provided in
_Section 2.4(b)_ or if the Seller Representative delivers a written notice
accepting

 



10  the Reconciliation Statement prior to the end of the thirty-day period, the
Reconciled Purchase Price shown on the Reconciliation Statement shall be
deemed to be the final amount of the Purchase Price for purposes of making
any adjustment required pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)_.

 

(ii) If the Seller Representative delivers an objection to the Reconciliation
Statement within the thirty-day period provided in _Section 2.4(b)_ and,
following good faith negotiation of the disputed items, Encore and the Seller
Representative reach agreement on the amount of the Reconciled Purchase Price
(whether by resolving each disputed item to their mutual satisfaction or
compromising any or all disputed items), then the amount of the Purchase Price
so agreed by them will be deemed to be the final amount of the Purchase Price
for purposes of making any adjustment required pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)_.

(iii) If the Seller Representative delivers an objection to the
Reconciliation Statement within the thirty-day period provided in _Section
2.4(b)_ and, following good faith negotiation of the disputed items, the
difference in the amount of the Purchase Price determined by Encore and the
amount of the Purchase Price determined by the Seller Representative (after
reflecting the resolution of any disputed items by the parties) is less than
or equal to $100,000, then the arithmetic mean between such two amounts shall
be deemed to be the final amount of the Purchase Price for purposes of making
any adjustment required pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)_.

(iv) If the Seller Representative delivers an objection to the Reconciliation
Statement within the thirty-day period provided in _Section 2.4(b)_ and,
following good faith negotiation of the disputed items, the difference in the
amount of Purchase Price determined by Encore and the amount of the Purchase
Price determined by the Seller Representative (after reflecting the resolution
of any disputed items by the parties) is greater than $100,000, then the
final amount of the Purchase Price for purposes of making any adjustment
required pursuant to _Section 2.4(e)_ shall be determined in accordance with
_Section 2.4(d)_.

 

(d) _Resolution of Disputes_.

 

(i) In accordance with _Section 2.4(c)(iv)_, Encore and the Seller
Representative (on behalf of Sellers) shall promptly refer all remaining
disputes concerning the Purchase Price to KPMG (or, if KPMG is not independent
or otherwise refuses or is incapable of undertaking the resolution of such
disputes, to such other nationally recognized independent accounting firm as
may be reasonably acceptable to Encore and the Seller Representative) (as
applicable, the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ "), together with a statement
of the Purchase Price asserted by the Seller Representative and by Encore.
The Independent Accounting Firm will be instructed to resolve such disputes
within sixty (60) days of the referral.

 

(ii) Encore and the Seller Representative will make available to the
Independent Accounting Firm, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice
at any time during the pendency of any dispute under this _Section 2.4(d)_,
the work papers and back-up materials used in preparing the Reconciliation
Statement and the Seller Representatives objections to the Reconciliation

 



11  Statement, and the books and records of the Sellers and the Acquired
Companies relating to the Purchase Price. Encore and the Seller Representative
shall have the right to meet jointly with the Independent Accounting Firm
during this period to present their respective positions. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall address only those matters in dispute and may not allow
a value greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party
or smaller than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The
amount of the Purchase Price determined by the Independent Accounting Firm
pursuant to this _Section 2.4(d)_ will be the final amount of the Purchase
Price for purposes of making any adjustment required pursuant to _Section
2.4(e)_. The resolution of disputes by the Independent Accounting Firm and its
determination of the Purchase Price will be set forth in writing and will
be conclusive and binding upon Encore, the Seller Representative, the Sellers
and all other interested Persons. The determination of the Purchase Price by
the Independent Accounting Firm will become final and binding upon the date of
such determination.

(iii) Encore and the Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers)
will each pay their own respective fees and expenses (including any fees and
expenses of their accountants and other representatives) in connection with
the resolution of disputes pursuant to this _Section 2.4(d)_. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm
incurred in connection with the resolution of disputes arising under this
_Section 2.4(d)_ will be paid by Encore and the Seller Representative in
proportion to the difference between the Purchase Price determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm and the respective amounts of the Purchase Price
asserted by each such party at the time of the initial referral of the
Purchase Price disputes to the Independent Accounting Firm.

(e) _Post-Closing Adjustment Payments_. The amount, if any, by which
the final Purchase Price exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price shall be paid
by Encore by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or
accounts as the Seller Representative may designate for disbursement to the
Sellers. The amount, if any, by which the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds
the final Purchase Price shall be paid through a release to Encore of such
amount from the Holdback pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. Any payment
pursuant to this _Section 2.4(e)_ will be due and payable five (5) Business
Days following the determination of the final Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 2.4(c)_ (and if necessary _Section 2.4(d)_).

 

(f) _Availability of Records_. Encore will make available to the Seller
Representative and its accountants and other representatives, at reasonable
times and upon reasonable notice (and copies thereof at the Seller
Representatives sole cost and expense), at any time during (i) the review by
the Seller Representative of the Reconciliation Statement and (ii) the
pendency of any dispute resolution under _Section 2.4(d)_, the books and
records of the Acquired Companies relevant to the Purchase Price. The Seller
Representative will make available to Encore and its accountants and other
representatives, at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice (and copies
thereof at Encores sole cost and expense), at any time during (i) the
preparation by Encore of the Reconciliation Statement and (ii) the pendency
of any dispute resolution under _Section 2.4(d)_, the books and records of
the Sellers relevant to the Purchase Price.

2.5 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Within sixty (60) days after the
determination of the final Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_ (and
if necessary  _Section 2.4(d)_), Encore shall

 



12  determine and deliver to the Seller Representative an allocation of the
consideration paid, or treated as paid, for federal income Tax purposes
(including any assumed liabilities as determined for federal income Tax
purposes) for the assets of the Acquired Companies among such assets in
accordance with Section 1060 of the Code, along with the supporting
documentation, such as appraisals. If Encore determines to engage an appraiser
or appraisers in connection with such allocation, Encore will consult with
Seller Representative on its selection of such appraiser(s) prior to engaging
such appraiser(s). The Seller Representative will have thirty (30) days in
which to review Encores proposed allocation, along with supporting
documentation, and provide to Encore any written objections thereto. For a
period of thirty (30) days after Encores receipt of any such written
objections, Encore and the Seller Representative will negotiate reasonably
and in good faith to resolve such objections. Encores proposed allocation of
the Purchase Price, as modified by any mutual agreements of Encore and the
Seller Representative during such negotiation period, will be final and
binding on all Parties and other Persons having an interest therein. Encore
and the Sellers agree (a) to file, and to cause their respective Affiliates to
file, all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such allocation and not to
take (and to cause their respective Affiliates not to take) any position
inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return, audit, examination, claim,
adjustment, litigation or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes, unless
required to do so by applicable Law or with prior written consent of the
other Parties and (b) that such allocation shall be further revised, as
necessary and in a manner consistent with such allocation, to reflect any
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 8.8_ or otherwise that
is not reflected in such allocation. In the event any Taxing Authority
disputes such Purchase Price allocation, the Party receiving notice thereof
shall promptly notify and consult with the other Parties concerning such
dispute.

3.11 _Title to and Condition of Assets and Properties_.

 

(a) _Owned Real Property_. Section 3.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets
forth the address and most recent assessed value (and, if available, the most
recent appraised value) of each REO Property. None of the Acquired Companies
own any real property or any interest in real property (other than the REO
Properties set forth on Section 3.11(a) of the Disclosure Schedule and rights
pursuant to the Real Property Leases). None of the REO Properties are used by
the Acquired Companies in the operation or conduct of the Business.

 

(b) _Leased Real Property_. The Real Property Leases cover all of the real
property leased by any Acquired Company from a third party (collectively, the
" _Leased Real Property_ "). The Leased Real Property constitutes all of the
land, buildings, structures, improvements, fixtures or other interests and
rights in real property that are used or occupied by the Acquired Companies
in connection with the Business. The Acquired Company named as lessee under
each Real Property Lease holds a valid, subsisting and enforceable leasehold
interest under such Real Property Lease, with such exceptions as do not
interfere in any material respect with the use made of such property in the
Business. No Acquired Company has assigned, transferred, conveyed or
encumbered any interest in any Real Property Leases or any of the Leased
Real Property. No Acquired Company is a lessor, sublessor or grantor under
any lease, sublease, consent, license or other instrument granting to another
person or entity any right to the possession, use, occupancy or enjoyment of
the Leased Real Property. All of the Leased Real Property has access to
public roads and to all utilities necessary for the operation of the Business.

 



22 (c) _Title to Personal Property Assets_. The Acquired Companies own good and
valid title to all of the Owned Personal Property, free and clear of all
Security Interests other than Security Interests set forth in Section 3.11(c)
of the Disclosure Schedule (all of which will be released at the Closing) and
Permitted Security Interests. " _Owned Personal Property_ " means all of the
tangible personal property and assets of the Acquired Companies shown on the
Latest Balance Sheet or acquired after the Latest Balance Sheet Date and all
of the intangible personal property and assets of the Acquired Companies, in
each case other than (i) tangible personal property and assets sold or
otherwise disposed of for fair value to non-affiliated third parties in the
Ordinary Course of Business since the Latest Balance Sheet Date and (ii)
obsolete assets discarded in the Ordinary Course of Business since the Latest
Balance Sheet Date.

 

(d) _Condition and Sufficiency of Assets_. All of the Acquired Companies
buildings, improvements, fixtures, physical plant, machinery, equipment and
other tangible assets are in good condition and repair, except for ordinary
wear and tear not caused by neglect, have been maintained in accordance with
the manufacturer specifications therefor and are useable in the Ordinary
Course of Business. The Leased Real Property, the Owned Personal Property, the
equipment that is leased by the Acquired Companies from third parties pursuant
to Company Contracts set forth in Section 3.10(b)(iii) of the Disclosure
Schedule and the Intellectual Property that is licensed by the Acquired
Companies from third parties pursuant to Company Contracts set forth in
Section 3.10(b)(iv) of the Disclosure Schedule include all of the assets,
properties and rights necessary for the conduct of the Business, consistent
with the past customs and practices of the Acquired Companies, and all assets,
properties and rights that were used to conduct the Business since the Latest
Balance Sheet Date.

3.12 _Receivables_.

 

(a) _Schedule of Receivables_. Section 3.12(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a complete and accurate list of each Receivable that has an outstanding
balance (whether or not including a principal balance) as of the date that is
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, including (i) the Person(s)
obligated thereon (each, an " _Obligor_ "), (ii) the outstanding balance
thereof as of such date (and the allocation of such balance among principal,
interest, fees and other amounts), (iii) the origination date and maturity
date thereof, (iv) the per annum interest rate payable thereunder, (v) the
address, tax block and lot identification number and parcel identification
number of the real property that secures such Receivable (the " _Subject
Property_ ") and (vi) the LTV Ratio. The Sellers have provided Encore with a
true and correct electronic copy of Section 3.12(a) of the Disclosure Schedule
formatted in accordance with the reasonable requirements of Encore.

 

(b) _Title to Subject Receivables_. An Acquired Company owns good and valid
title to, and is the sole owner of record and holder of, each Receivable that
has an outstanding balance (whether or not including a principal balance) as
of Effective Time (the " _Subject Receivables_ ") and the indebtedness
evidenced thereby, and the liens securing same, free and clear of all
Security Interests other than Security Interests set forth in Section 3.11(c)
of the Disclosure Schedule (all of which will be released at the Closing).

 

(c) _Enforceability of Subject Receivables_. Each of the Subject Receivables
(i) is a valid and enforceable receivable for the amount thereof (and is not
subject to any counterclaim, rescission, deduction, credit, refund, set-off or
other offset) and (ii) was incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business.

 



23 (d) _Loan Documents_. To the extent required by applicable Laws or the
internal underwriting standards of the Acquired Companies, the Acquired
Companies possess true and correct copies (or originals to the extent required
by applicable Law) of (i) all loan agreements, credit agreements, promissory
notes, property tax payment agreements, documents authorizing transfer of tax
lien, certified statements of transfer of tax lien, mortgages, deeds of trust,
tax lien contracts, security deeds, security agreements, guarantees and
other Contracts executed by any Obligor or otherwise relating to each Subject
Receivable, including all amendments, restatements, waivers, consents and
assignments thereof or relating thereto (collectively, the " _Loan Agreements_
") and (ii) all loan applications, file maintenance information, payment
histories, receipts, transfer affidavits, correspondence, notices (including
notices of right to cancel documents), acknowledgments, disclosure documents
and any other information, documents, instruments or records (in each case,
whether in written, electronic or other form) relating to each Subject
Receivable (collectively, and together with the Loan Agreements, the " _Loan
Documents_ "). Each Loan Agreement is genuine and constitutes the valid and
legally binding obligations of each Obligor specified therein, enforceable
against each such Obligor in accordance with its terms. No Loan Agreement has
been satisfied, cancelled, subordinated or rescinded, in whole or in part,
and no instrument has been executed that would affect any such cancellation,
subordination or rescission, except that the Acquired Companies file partial
releases in the Ordinary Course of Business as certain Loan Agreements are
satisfied although the Subject Property may remain subject to an Acquired
Companys lien for subsequent loans which remain outstanding. The Loan
Documents contain the entire agreement and understanding between the
Obligor(s) and the Acquired Companies with respect to each Subject Receivable
and no Acquired Company has entered into any Contract with any Person other
than an Obligor that affects or relates to any Subject Receivable. To the
Knowledge of the Sellers, the Loan Documents do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact by any Obligor or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements of the Obligors contained therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which made, not misleading.

(e) _Security Documents_. The mortgages, deeds of trust, tax lien
contracts, security agreements and/or other Loan Agreements evidencing the
assignment of a lien or security interest on the Subject Property securing
each Subject Receivable (the " _Security Documents_ ") establish a valid,
subsisting, enforceable and perfected superior lien on such Subject Property.
Except for certain recent loans originated in the Ordinary Course of Business
wherein a governmental entity has not yet returned an executed tax lien
transfer affidavit, with respect to each Subject Receivable, the Obligor and
all governmental entities who collect taxes on the Subject Property have
executed the tax lien transfer affidavits required by the Texas Property Tax
Code or other applicable Law. Each Security Document and tax lien transfer
document is in recordable form and has been properly recorded (or, with
respect to certain recent new loans originated in the Ordinary Course of
Business wherein a governmental entity has not yet returned an executed tax
lien transfer affidavit, will be timely and properly recorded in the Ordinary
Course of Business) under applicable Law in the county where the Subject
Property is located. Notice of the liens created by the Security Documents
have been sent to all Persons in the form, and within the deadlines required
by, the Texas Property Tax Code or other applicable Law. Except in the
Ordinary Course of Business, no Subject Property has been released from the
lien of the Security Documents, in whole or in part, and no instrument has
been executed that would affect any such release (except that the Acquired
Companies file partial releases in the Ordinary Course of Business as certain
Loan Agreements are satisfied although the Subject Property may remain subject
to an Acquired Companys lien for subsequent loans which remain outstanding).

(f)  _Adequate Rights of Sale or Foreclosure_. With respect to each Security
Document that is a deed of trust or tax lien contract, a trustee, authorized
and duly qualified under applicable Law to serve as such, has been properly
designated and currently so serves and is named in such deed of trust or tax
lien contract, and no fees or expenses are or will become payable by an
Acquired Company to any such trustee except in connection with a trustees
sale after default by the applicable Obligor and non-material amounts due to
a taxing authorities

 



24  collection agent. The Security Documents contain customary and enforceable
provisions sufficient to render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof
adequate for the realization against the Subject Property of the benefits of
the security provided thereby, including by trustees sale (in the case of a
deed of trust or tax lien contract) or otherwise by judicial foreclosure. Upon
default by an Obligor on a Subject Receivable and foreclosure on, or
trustees sale of, the Subject Property, the holder of such Subject Receivable
will be able to deliver good and merchantable title to the Subject Property.
Except for the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, formerly the Soldiers and
Sailors Civil Relief Act of 1940, there is no homestead or other exemption
available to any Obligor that would interfere with the right to sell the
Subject Property at a trustees sale or the right to foreclose on the Subject
Property pursuant to the Security Documents, subject to applicable federal and
state Laws and judicial precedent with respect to bankruptcy and right of
redemption.

 

(g) _Subject Property_. The lien of the applicable Security Documents in each
Subject Property covers all buildings on the Subject Property and all
installations and mechanical, electrical, plumbing, heating and air
conditioning systems located in or annexed to such buildings, and all
additions, alterations and replacements made at any time with respect to the
foregoing to the extent such property is not removable and has legally become
attached to the Subject Property. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, there is no
circumstance or condition relating to any Subject Property that
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the value or the
marketability of any Subject Receivable or such Subject Property (including
any condemnation proceeding, casualty loss or violation of environmental Law).
The LTV Ratios set forth in Section 3.12(a) of the Disclosure Schedule are
true and correct in all material respects.

 

(h) _Certain Terms of the Loan Agreements_. The Loan Agreements provide for
the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of the
applicable Subject Receivable after any required notice to the Obligor is
provided, at the option of the holder of such Subject Receivable to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, in the event that the relevant Subject Property
is sold or transferred without the prior written consent of such holder. The
Loan Agreements do not contain any provisions pursuant to which monthly
payments are paid or partially paid with funds deposited in any separate
account established by the Acquired Companies, the Obligor or anyone on behalf
of the Obligor, or paid by any source other than the Obligor, nor do the Loan
Agreements contain any other similar provisions that may constitute
a "buydown" provision. No Subject Receivable (i) is a graduated payment
mortgage loan, (ii) contains a shared appreciation or other contingent
interest feature or (iii) is subject to, or potentially subject to,
negative amortization. Section 3.12(h) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth
each Subject Receivable for which any broker or other third party is entitled
to receive a fee upon the collection of such Subject Receivable, and the
amount (or manner of calculation) of such fee.

(i) _Full Funding of Lending Obligations_. Each lending obligation of the
Acquired Companies has been closed and fully funded and disbursed (and the
underlying tax obligation, interest, fees and costs of the borrower paid in
full) and there is no requirement for future advances thereunder;  _provided_
, _however_ , payment of expenses posted after transfer may be due to a taxing
authorities collection agent for collection of certain Subject Receivables.
All costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Acquired Companies in making or
closing each such loan have been paid in full. No Subject Receivable is
subject to a right of rescission or cancellation in favor of any Obligor that
has not expired. No Obligor is entitled to any refund of any amounts paid or
due under any Loan Agreement.

(j) _No Obligor Default_. Section 3.12(a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets
forth an aging report of the Subject Receivables as of the date that is five
(5) Business Days prior

 



25  to the Closing Date. Other than such delinquencies disclosed in Section
3.12(a) of the Disclosure Schedule and non-monetary defaults, there is no
default, breach, violation or event of acceleration existing under any Loan
Agreements and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, no event has occurred that,
with the passage of time or the giving of notice and the expiration of any
applicable grace or cure period, would constitute any such default, breach,
violation or event of acceleration. No waiver or forbearance of any prior
default, breach, violation or event of acceleration under any Loan Agreement
has been given to any Obligor by any Acquired Company (or any of their
respective predecessors in interest). No Obligor has been released, in whole
or in part, from its obligations with respect to any Subject Receivable or the
applicable Loan Agreements. No Obligor has notified any Acquired Company in
writing of any relief requested or allowed to such Obligor under the
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, formerly the Soldiers and Sailors Civil
Relief Act of 1940.

Each representation and warranty in this Section 3.12 regarding the
enforceability of the Receivables or the availability of certain remedies when
collecting the Receivables is subject to the limitations imposed by the
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, formerly the Soldiers and Sailors Civil
Relief Act of 1940, Texas Tax Code Section 33.06 (allowing persons over the
age of 65 years or disabled to defer collection of taxes, to abate a suit to
collect taxes or to abate a sale to foreclose a tax lien on such persons
homestead) and other similar state or federal laws which may prevent immediate
enforceability of remedies, including foreclosure.

 

3.13 _Intellectual Property_.

 

(a) _Title_. The Acquired Companies own or have the right to use all
Intellectual Property necessary for the operation of the Business as
currently conducted. No current or former employee, agent, consultant or
contractor has asserted any claims, in writing or orally, to any such
Intellectual Property. All employees, agents, consultants or contractors who
have contributed to or participated in the creation or development of any
Intellectual Property on behalf of any Acquired Company (of any predecessor in
interest thereto): (i) created such materials in the scope of his or
her employment; (ii) is a party to a "work-for-hire" agreement under which
such Acquired Company is deemed to be the original owner/author of all rights,
title and interest therein; or (iii) has executed an assignment or an
agreement to assign in favor of such Acquired Company (or such predecessor in
interest, as applicable) of all right, title and interest in such material.
Each item of Intellectual Property owned or used by or licensed to the
Acquired Companies immediately prior to the Effective Time will be owned or
available for use by the Acquired Companies on identical terms and conditions
immediately after the Effective Time. The Acquired Companies have taken all
necessary action to protect in the United States each item of Intellectual
Property that they own.

(b) _No Infringement_. The Acquired Companies have not interfered with,
infringed upon, misappropriated, or otherwise come into conflict with any
Intellectual Property rights of third parties, and neither the Acquired
Companies nor any of their respective directors, managers, officers and
employees with responsibility for Intellectual Property matters has ever
received any charge, complaint, claim, or notice alleging any such
interference, infringement, misappropriation, or violation. To the Knowledge
of the Sellers, no third party has interfered with, infringed upon,
misappropriated, or otherwise come into conflict with any Intellectual
Property rights of the Acquired Companies.

 

(c) _Owned Intellectual Property_. Section 3.13(c) of the Disclosure Schedule
identifies (i) each patent, trademark registration or copyright registration
that has been issued to any Acquired Company, (ii) each pending patent
application or application for trademark or copyright registration that any
Acquired Company has made and (iii) each license, agreement or other
permission that any Acquired Company has granted to any third party with
respect to Intellectual Property (together with any exceptions). The Sellers
have previously provided to Encore correct and complete copies of all such
patents, registrations, applications, licenses, agreements, and permissions
(as amended to date) and all other written documentation evidencing ownership
and prosecution (if applicable) of each such item. With respect to each item
of Intellectual Property that any Acquired Company owns, (A) an Acquired
Company possesses all right, title, and interest in and to the item, (B) the
item is not subject to any Order and (C) no 

 



26  Proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened that
challenges the legality, validity, enforceability, use, or ownership of the
item.

 

(d) _Licensed Intellectual Property_. Section 3.13(d) of the Disclosure
Schedule identifies each item of Intellectual Property that any third party
owns and that any Acquired Company uses pursuant to any license, sublicense,
agreement or permission (except that "off-the-shelf" software purchased for
use in the day-to-day operations of the Business need not be so identified).
The Sellers have previously provided to Encore correct and complete copies of
all such licenses, sublicenses, agreements and permissions (as amended to
date). With respect to each such item of third party Intellectual Property

(e)  _Databases; Personally Identifiable Information_. Section 3.13(e) of the
Disclosure Schedule describes in reasonable detail all databases of Obligors
Personally Identifiable Information owned or used by the Acquired Companies
in connection with the operation of or otherwise relating to the Business
(the " _Databases_ "), and the nature and quantity of data contained therein.
Following the Closing, the Databases will have at least the same functionality
as exists immediately prior to the Closing. None of the Acquired Companies
have sold, assigned, leased, transferred, permitted the use of or otherwise
disclosed to any Person any information contained in any of the Databases,
including any Personally Identifiable Information, and all information
contained in the Databases has been collected, used and maintained in
accordance with all applicable privacy Laws. The consummation of the Purchase
Transaction will not violate any privacy policy applicable to any Personally
Identifiable Information contained in the Databases at the time such
Personally Identifiable Information was collected. For purposes hereof, "

employees, on the other hand (including any claims for actual or alleged
harassment or discrimination based on race, national origin, age, sex, sexual
orientation, religion, disability, or similar tortious conduct, breach of
contract, wrongful termination, defamation, intentional or negligent
infliction of emotional distress, interference with contract or interference
with actual or prospective economic advantage). There are no claims pending

3.15 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) Section 3.15(a) of the Disclosure Schedule contains an accurate
and complete list of all Employee Benefit Plans (i) maintained or sponsored
by any Acquired Company, (ii) contributed to by any Acquired Company or to
which any Acquired Company is obligated to contribute or (iii) with respect to
which any Acquired Company has any liability or potential liability (whether
direct or indirect, including all Employee Benefit Plans contributed to,
maintained or sponsored by each member of the controlled group of companies,
within the meaning of Sections 414(b), (c) and (m) of the Code, of which any
Acquired Company is a member to the extent such Acquired Company has any
liability or potential liability with respect to such Employee Benefit Plans).
The Employee Benefit Plans disclosed or required to be disclosed in Section
3.15(a) of the Disclosure Schedule are referred to collectively herein as the
" _Company Employee Benefit Plans_."

 

(b) There are no plans or agreements that would prevent any Acquired Company
from withdrawing from any "employee pension benefit plan" (within the meaning
set forth in ERISA Sec. 3(2)) that is contributed to by an Acquired Company
without any further obligation or liability. Except for the continuation
coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA or applicable state continuation coverage Law, no Acquired
Company has obligations or potential liability for benefits to employees,
former employees or their respective dependents following termination of
employment or retirement under any Company Employee Benefit Plan, whether or
not terminated, that provides health, life insurance, accident or other
"welfare-type" benefits to current or future retirees, current or future
former employees, or current or future former independent contractors, their
spouses, dependents, or other beneficiaries.

(c) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event such as termination of employment or other service) (i)
result in or cause any payment (whether of separation, severance or
termination pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness,
vesting, distribution or increase in benefits with respect to any Company
Employee Benefit Plan or any current or former director, manager, officer,
employee or other service provider of any Acquired Company, or give rise to
any obligation to fund any such

 



28  payment or benefit, (ii) limit the ability of the Acquired Companies to
amend or terminate any Company Employee Benefit Plan or (iii) result in any
payment or benefit that will or may be made that will be characterized as an
"excess parachute payment," within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.
None of the Company Employee Benefit Plans obligates any Acquired Company to
pay separation, severance, termination or similar benefits (whether or not
resulting from the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby).

 

(d) With respect to each Company Employee Benefit Plan, all required payments,
premiums, contributions, reimbursements or accruals for all periods ending
prior to or as of the Effective Time shall have been made or properly accrued
for on the Financial Statements. No Company Employee Benefit Plan has any
unfunded liabilities.

 

(e) Each Company Employee Benefit Plan and all related trusts, insurance
contracts and funds have been maintained, funded and administered in
compliance in all material respects with its terms and all applicable Laws,
including ERISA and the Code. No Acquired Company and no trustee or
administrator of any Company Employee Benefit Plan, or other person has
engaged in any transaction with respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan
that could subject any Acquired Company or any trustee or administrator of
such Company Employee Benefit Plan, or any party dealing with such Company
Employee Benefit Plan, to any Tax or penalty (whether civil or otherwise)
imposed by ERISA or the Code. No Proceedings with respect to the Company
Employee Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for benefits) or any
fiduciary or other person dealing with such Company Employee Benefit Plans
are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened and there are no
facts that could reasonably give rise to or reasonably be expected to give
rise to any such Proceedings.

 

(f) No underfunded "defined benefit plan," as such term is defined in Section
3(35) of ERISA, has been, during the six (6) years preceding the Effective
Time, transferred out of the controlled group of companies (within the meaning
of Sections 414(b), (c) and (m) of the Code) of which any Acquired Company is
a member or was a member during such six-year period.

(g) No Seller, no Acquired Company and no officer, director, manager,
employee or agent of any Acquired Company has made any statements, whether
oral or written, regarding the Company Employee Benefit Plans or other
compensation or benefit arrangements to be maintained (or not to be
maintained) by the Acquired Companies after the Effective Time that will
result in additional liability to the Acquired Companies or Encore, whether
direct or indirect, in excess of any existing liability of the Acquired
Companies as of the Effective Time. 

(h) Each Company Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code, and each trust (if any) forming a part
thereof, has either received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as
to the qualification under the Code of such Company Employee Benefit Plan and
the tax-exempt status of such related trust, or the applicable remedial
amendment period for seeking such a determination has not expired. The Sellers
have delivered to Encore a copy of the most recent such determination letter
and nothing has occurred since the date of such determination letter that
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualification of such
Company Employee Benefit Plan or the tax-exempt status of such related trust.

 

(i) With respect to each Company Employee Benefit Plan, the Sellers have
provided Encore with true, complete and correct copies, to the extent
applicable, of (i) all

 



29  documents pursuant to which the Company Employee Benefit Plans as currently
in effect are maintained, funded and administered, (ii) the two most recent
annual reports (Form 5500 series) filed with the IRS (with attachments),
(iii) the two most recent financial statements, and (iv) all governmental
rulings, determinations, and opinions (and pending requests for rulings,
determinations or opinions).

 

(j) No Acquired Company has any Liabilities of the kind required to be
disclosed pursuant to SFAS No. 106 or SFAS No. 112\.

(k) No Company Employee Benefit Plan is, or provides benefits that are,
subject to Section 409A of the Code.

(l) Except as specifically provided in the Transition Services Agreement, as
of the Effective Time, the Acquired Companies will cease participation in all
Company Employee Benefit Plans sponsored, maintained or administered by
McCombs.

 

3.16 _Legal Compliance; Permits_.

 

(a) _Generally_. The Acquired Companies are, and have been at all times since
January 1, 2009, in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
Laws that affect the Business, the Properties or Assets (including zoning,
building code or subdivision ordinances and occupational health and safety
Laws) and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, the REO Properties and the
Subject Property. No Proceeding has been filed, commenced or, to the Knowledge
of the Sellers, threatened against any Acquired Company alleging any such
violation. Neither any Acquired Company nor any predecessor entity has ever
been charged with (or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, has been or is now
under investigation with respect to) any possible violation of any Law
relating to its business, its business practices, its employment practices or
the safety of working conditions in its facilities, or its employee pension
or welfare benefit plans. The Acquired Companies have timely filed all
material reports, data and other information required to be filed with
governmental authorities under applicable Laws.

(b) _Lending_. Each of the Subject Receivables was originated, underwritten
and documented, and has been serviced, in compliance with all applicable Laws.
Each Person who originated or has had an interest in the Subject Receivables
(whether as mortgagee, assignee, pledgee or otherwise) is (or, during the
period in which they held and disposed of such interest, was) appropriately
licensed and qualified in compliance with all applicable Laws. No fraud or
unfair or deceptive trade practices were committed in connection with the
origination of any of the Subject Receivables.

(c) _Permits_. Section 3.16(c) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and correct list of each Business Permit, including the identity of
the governmental authority issuing the Business Permit and the expiration
date, if any, thereof. The Acquired Companies possess all Business Permits and
all Business Permits are valid, in full force and effect and will continue to
be in full force and effect immediately after the Closing; provided that all
consents required to assign, transfer or issue the Business Permits to Encore
are obtained prior to Closing. The Acquired Companies are in material
compliance with the terms and conditions of all Business Permits and there has
been no material violation by any Acquired Company (or event that with the
passage of time, the giving of notice or both would constitute a violation)
of any Business Permit that has not been cured or waived. No Acquired Company
has received any notice of non-compliance, revocation or termination of any
Business Permit or notice of any 

 



30  allegation, dispute or other event that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the rights of the Acquired Companies under any such Business
Permit.

 

(d) _Environmental_. The Acquired Companies are, and have always been, in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental Laws
that affect the Business or the Properties or Assets, and no Proceeding has
been filed, commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened against
any Acquired Company alleging any such violation. Neither any Acquired
Company nor any predecessor entity has ever been charged with (or, to the
Knowledge of the Sellers, has been or is now under investigation with respect
to) any possible violation of any environmental Law. No Acquired Company has
received any notice from any Person (including any governmental authority or
the current or prior owner or operator of any property owned or leased by an
Acquired Company) with respect to (i) any violation or failure to comply
with any environmental Law, (ii) any obligation for any Acquired Company to
undertake or bear the cost of any environmental remediation or (iii) any harm
to the environment at any property owned or leased by an Acquired Company or
otherwise used by an Acquired Company in connection with the Business,
including off-site disposal sites. The Acquired Companies have timely filed
all material reports, data and other information required to be filed with
governmental authorities under applicable environmental Laws. Neither the
Acquired Companies nor their respective Properties or Assets (nor, to the
Knowledge of the Sellers, any Subject Property or any of the REO Properties)
are subject to any Order pursuant to any environmental Law or in connection
with hazardous materials or substances. No Acquired Company has disposed of,
released (meaning any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying,
discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping or disposing into the
environment, without giving effect to any thresholds on quantity or time in
any environmental Law) or placed any hazardous materials or substances on,
under or at any property owned or leased by an Acquired Company or otherwise
used by an Acquired Company in connection with the Business. The Acquired
Companies do not have any environmental Liabilities and none of the properties
and assets of the Acquired Companies are subject to any lien arising under or
pursuant to any environmental Laws.

(e) _Employee Disclosures_. To the Knowledge of the Sellers, no employee of
any Acquired Company has provided or is providing information to any law
enforcement agency regarding the commission or possible commission of any
crime or the violation or possible violation of any applicable Law involving
any Acquired Company or the Business. Neither any Acquired Company nor any
officer or employee of any Acquired Company, nor any contractor, subcontractor
or agent of any Acquired Company for which any Acquired Company may be legally
responsible has discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed or in
any other manner discriminated against an employee of any Acquired Company in
the terms and conditions of employment because of any act of such employee
described in 18 U.S.C. Section 1514A(a).

 

3.17 _Litigation_. Section 3.17 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth each
instance in which any Acquired Company (a) is subject to any unsatisfied
Order, (b) is a party to any Proceeding, (c) has been threatened to be made a
party to any Proceeding or (d) has been a party to any other Proceeding at any
time since its formation in which (i) the amount in controversy exceeded
$25,000 or (ii) equitable relief was sought against an Acquired Company. None
of the Proceedings set forth in Section 3.17 of the Disclosure Schedule could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change. To the
Knowledge of the Sellers, there is no Basis on which any other Proceeding may
be brought or threatened against the Business or any Acquired Company.

 



31 3.18 _Taxes_.

 

(a) All Tax Returns that are required to be filed on or before the date hereof

other third party copies of any such Tax Returns required to be delivered to
any third party on or before the date hereof have been timely delivered in
accordance with applicable Law to the appropriate third parties on or before
the date hereof. All such Tax Returns and the information and data contained
therein have been properly and accurately compiled and completed under
applicable Laws and properly reflect, under applicable Laws, Liabilities for
Taxes for the periods covered by such Tax Returns. All Taxes due and owing
under applicable Laws by each Acquired Company (whether or not shown to be
due and payable on any Tax Return) have been paid in full. No Acquired Company
and no Person on behalf of any Acquired Company has requested any extension of
time within which to file any Tax Return, which Tax Return has not been
filed.

(b) No Acquired Company is under audit or examination by any Taxing Authority
with respect to any Tax, no notice of such an audit or examination has been
received by any Acquired Company, there are no matters under discussion with
any Taxing Authority with respect to Taxes and, to the Knowledge of the
Sellers, no audits, investigations or claims for or relating to Taxes are
threatened against any Acquired Company. No issues relating to Taxes of any
Acquired Company were raised by the relevant Taxing Authority in any
completed audit or examination that can reasonably be expected to recur in a
later taxable period. The Sellers have delivered to Encore copies of all
examiners or auditors reports, notices of proposed adjustments or similar
correspondence received by any Acquired Company or any Seller from any Taxing
Authority. There exists no proposed assessment of Taxes against any Acquired
Company.

(c) All Tax Returns filed by each Acquired Company with respect to Tax years
through the Tax year ended December 31, 2007, have been examined and closed by
the appropriate Taxing Authority (and no deficiencies were asserted as a
result of any such examinations that have not been resolved and fully paid) or
are Tax Returns with respect to which the applicable period for assessment and
collection under applicable Laws, after giving effect to extensions or
waivers, has expired, and, with respect to all other Tax Returns, no Acquired
Company has agreed to any extension or waiver of the statute of limitations
applicable to any Tax, or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a
Tax assessment or deficiency, which period (after giving effect to such
extension or waiver) has not yet expired.

local, and foreign Tax Returns filed with respect to each Acquired Company for
taxable periods ended on or after December 31, 2007, and indicates those Tax
Returns that have been audited. Copies of all federal, state, local and

attorney granted by any Acquired Company with respect to any Taxes is
currently in force.

practice with respect to Taxes, including any advance pricing agreement,
closing agreement, compromise, ruling or other agreement with any Taxing
Authority that relates to the assessment or collection of Taxes. 

 



32 (f) Except for liens for property Taxes not yet due and payable, there are no
Security Interests for unpaid Taxes on the assets of any Acquired Company and
no claim for unpaid Taxes has been made by any Taxing Authority that could
give rise to any such Security Interest.

 

(g) No Acquired Company (i) is, or ever has been, a member of an "affiliated
group" of corporations within the meaning of Section 1504 of the Code and
(ii) has any liability for Taxes of any Person under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), or
as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.

(h) The aggregate liability of the Acquired Companies for unpaid Taxes for
all periods ending on or before the Latest Balance Sheet Date does not exceed
the amount of the current liability accrual for Taxes (excluding reserves for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet. Since the Latest Balance Sheet
Date, no Acquired Company has incurred Taxes other than Taxes incurred in the
Ordinary Course of Business.

 

(i) Each Acquired Company has withheld or collected and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority all Taxes required by applicable Law to be
withheld or collected, including withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections
1441 through 1464, 3401 through 3406, 6041 and 6049 of the Code and similar
provisions under any state, local or foreign Law, and each Acquired Company
has properly received and maintained any and all certificates, forms and other
documents required by applicable Law for any exemption from withholding and
remitting any Taxes.

 

(j) No Acquired Company is a party to any agreement, contract, arrangement or
plan, individually or in the aggregate, that has resulted, or could result,
upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
(i) the payment of "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section
280G of the Code, or (ii) an obligation to indemnify, gross-up or otherwise
compensate any Person, in whole or in part, for any excise Tax under Section

(l) Each Acquired Company has disclosed on applicable Tax Returns all
positions taken therein that could give rise to a "substantial understatement
of income tax" within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code. No Acquired
Company has engaged in any transaction described as a "reportable transaction"
in Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b), including any transaction that is
the same or substantially similar to a transaction that the IRS has
determined to be a Tax avoidance transaction or that the IRS has identified
through a notice, Treasury Regulation or other form of published guidance as a
"listed transaction," as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.6011-4(b)(2).

(m) No Acquired Company owns a direct interest in real estate that as a
result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
would result in the imposition of any realty transfer Tax or similar Tax.

 



33 (n) The Sellers have provided to Encore true, accurate and complete copies of
all written memoranda or opinions of advisors relating or pertaining to any
Tax of the Acquired Companies.

(o) Each of Propel and BNC is, and at all times since January 1, 2010, and
prior to and at the Effective Time has been and will be, classified as a
partnership for U.S. federal Tax purposes under Treasury Regulations §§
301.7701-2 and 301.7701-3 (and state, local, and foreign Tax purposes where
applicable) (a " _Partnership_ "), and no election has been or will be filed,
no action has been or will be taken and no failure to act has occurred or
will occur, in each case prior to the Effective Time, that would result in any
Acquired Company being classified at the Effective Time as an entity that is
not a Partnership for U.S. federal Tax purposes (and state, local, and
foreign Tax purposes where applicable). Each of Propel and BNC was, at all
times since its formation or organization through December 31, 2009,
disregarded as an entity for U.S. federal Tax purposes under Treasury
Regulations §§ 301.7701-2 and 301.7701-3 (and state, local, and foreign Tax
purposes where applicable).

(p) Each of RPV and RPH is, and at all times since its formation or
organization and prior to and at the Effective Time has been, classified as a
Partnership for U.S. federal Tax purposes (and state, local, and foreign Tax
purposes where applicable), and no election has been or will be filed, no
action has been or will be taken and no failure to act has occurred or will
occur, in each case prior to the Effective Time, that would result in RPV
or RPH being classified at the Effective Time as an entity that is not a
Partnership for U.S. federal Tax purposes (and state, local, and foreign Tax
purposes where applicable).

 

(q) No Acquired Company will be required to include any item of income in, or
exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable period (or
portion thereof) ending after the Effective Time as a result of any:

(i) change in the method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or prior
to the Effective Time;

 

(ii) "closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law)
executed on or prior to the Effective Time;

(iii) intercompany transaction or excess loss account described in the
Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant to Section 1502 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax
Law);

(iv) installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the
Effective Time; or

 



34 (v) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Effective Time.

(r) No claim has ever been made by any governmental authority in a
jurisdiction where any of the Acquired Companies does not file Tax Returns
that any of the Acquired Companies is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction and there is no basis for any such claim to be made.

 

(s) None of the Acquired Companies has ever acquired or owned any interest in
any entity classified as a corporation for U.S. federal Tax purposes under

3.19 _Insurance_. Section 3.19 of the Disclosure Schedule lists each insurance
policy and self-insurance program maintained by each Acquired Company
(excluding Company Employee Benefit Plans). The policies of insurance
maintained by each Acquired Company cover such risks, and are in such amounts
and with such deductibles and exclusions, as are reasonable for the business
transacted by such Acquired Company and for its respective properties and
assets. All such insurance policies are in full force and effect, and no
Acquired Company is in default with respect to its obligations under any of
such insurance policies (including with respect to the payment of premiums),
and no event has occurred that, with notice or the lapse of time or both,
would constitute such a default or permit termination, modification or
acceleration under such policy. No Acquired Company and no Seller has
received any written notice from or on behalf of any insurance carrier issuing
policies relating to or covering any Acquired Company, the Business or their
respective Properties or Assets that there has been or will be a cancellation
or non-renewal of, or any material premium increase with respect to, any
existing policies. There is no material claim by any Acquired Company pending
under any such insurance policy as to which coverage has been questioned,
denied or disputed by the underwriters of such policy. To the extent that any
Acquired Company self-insures any of its properties or risks, such self-
insurance protects against such casualties and contingencies and at such
levels as are in accordance with reasonable business practices.

3.20 _Illegal or Improper Payments_. Neither the Acquired Companies, nor any
of their respective predecessor entities (if any), nor any of their respective
owners, Affiliates, managers, officers, employees, nor any other Person acting

(b) been involved in the disbursement or receipt of company funds outside of
the Acquired Companies normal internal control systems of accountability;

(c) made or received payments, whether direct or indirect, to or from foreign

assets in the manner described; or

(d) been involved in the improper or inaccurate recording of payments and
receipts on the accounting books of the Acquired Companies or any other
matters of a similar nature involving disbursements of any Acquired Companys
funds or assets.

 

3.21 _Related Party Transactions_. No Related Party (a) is a party to any
Company Contract or any other Contract that pertains to the Business or (b)
has any interest in any property used in

 



35  or pertaining to the Business, other than (i) Contracts for employment set
forth in Section 3.10(b)(v) of the Disclosure Schedule, (ii) Contracts listed
in Section 3.21 of the Disclosure Schedule and (iii) salaries, expense

(12) month period immediately preceding the Effective Time, whether or not
pursuant to a Contract.

3.22 _Arizona Tax Liens_. Section 3.22 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a complete and accurate list of each Arizona Tax Lien as of the date that is
five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, including (i) the purchase
price paid by the Acquired Companies for such Arizona Tax Lien, (ii) the

order is issued and such Person is, in the opinion of its counsel, compelled
to disclose such Confidential Information under pain of liability for
contempt of court or other censure or penalty, such Person may disclose such

Released Party from any obligations set forth in this Agreement, or in any
other Contract to be executed and delivered at the Closing pursuant to
_Section 2.6_, to the extent such obligations are to be paid or performed
after the Effective Time or (ii) any Acquired Company from any obligations of
such Acquired Company to pay or provide to any Related Party of a Seller who

40 ARTICLE 7

INDEMNIFICATION

7.1 _Risk Allocation_. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements made herein are intended, among other things, to allocate among the
Parties the risks inherent in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Accordingly, an Indemnified Party shall be entitled to the remedies
prescribed in this Agreement by reason of any breach of any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement regardless of whether such
Indemnified Party (or any employee, representative or agent of such
Indemnified Party) knew or had reason to know of such breach. The right to
indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based on such representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements will not be affected by any investigation
conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) about, the accuracy or inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. With respect to any claim for
indemnification under this _Article 7_  relating to a breach of a
representation or warranty that contains a materiality qualifier (including
"in all material respects" and "Material Adverse Change"), such materiality
qualifier will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether a breach of
such representation and warranty has occurred and for purposes of determining
the amount of the Losses arising out of such breach (other than the use of
"Material Adverse Change" in the first sentence of  _Section 3.9_ and
"material" in Section 3.8(b), which shall not be disregarded).

7.2  _Survival_.

(a) _Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties of
the Sellers and Encore set forth in this Agreement, and in any certificate or
instrument delivered at the Closing, shall survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the Closing and continue in full force and effect
thereafter until the two-year anniversary of the Effective Time, except that
(i) the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.12_
(Receivables) and _Section 3.16_ (Legal Compliance; Permits) will survive
until the three-year anniversary of the Effective Time, (ii) the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.15_ (Employee
Benefits) and _Section 3.18_ (Taxes) will survive until thirty (30) days
after the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable thereto and
(iii) the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.7_
(Capitalization), _Section 4.1_ (Organization; Power and Authority), _Section
4.2_ (Authorization of Transaction), _Section 4.3_ (Due Execution;
Enforceability) and _Section 4.7_ (Title to Securities) will survive
indefinitely. No claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.3_ or
_Section 7.4_ based on the breach of a representation or warranty may be
asserted after the date on which such representation or warranty expires,
except to the extent that such claim is based on fraud in which case it may be
asserted at any time prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations
applicable thereto. A claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.3_ or
_Section 7.4_ based on the breach of a representation or warranty that is
asserted prior to the date on which such representation or warranty expires
may be maintained until such claim is finally resolved in accordance with this
_Article 7_.

(b) _Covenants_. All covenants and agreements made by the Parties in this
Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Closing and continue in full force and effect thereafter for so long as such
covenants remain executory in nature.

7.3 _Indemnification by the Sellers_. Subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 7.6_, from and after the Effective Time, the Sellers shall be
obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless (including by reimbursement
for Losses) Encore and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) and
their respective directors, managers, officers, employees and agents
(collectively, the " _Encore_

 



41   _Indemnitees_ ") from and against the entirety of any Loss that any Encore
Indemnitee may suffer that results from, arises out of, relates to, is in the
nature of, or is caused by, any one or more of the following:

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in
_Article 3_ or in any certificate or instrument delivered at the Closing by or
on behalf of the Sellers (or any allegation by a third party that, if true,
would constitute such a breach or inaccuracy);

 

(b) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in
_Article 4_ (or any allegation by a third party that, if true, would
constitute such a breach or inaccuracy);

(c) any breach or non-performance by any Seller of any covenant, agreement or
undertaking contained in this Agreement;

(d) any claim by or through any member, owner, manager, officer or employee
(or former member, owner, officer or employee) of any Acquired Company or any
predecessor entity (including Sam Feldman) for any payment (or alleged
payment) arising out of, relating to or resulting from this Agreement, the
consummation of the Purchase Transaction or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any claim for any change in
control, transaction bonus, severance payment or any entitlement to the
Purchase Price (or any portion thereof or interest therein), based on any
obligation or liability arising or existing prior to the Effective Time;

 

(e) the existence, ownership, operation, dissolution, business, assets or
liabilities of Tax Lien Processing, LLC, a Texas limited liability company,
Propel Insurance, LLC, a Texas limited liability company or Mineral Financial
Services, LLC;

(f) the Arizona Tax Liens, including the amount, if any, by which the
aggregate amount realized upon the redemption, foreclosure, liquidation or
other disposition of any Arizona Tax Lien that is owned by an Acquired
Company at the Effective Time, if any, is less than the portion of the Arizona
Lien Price attributable to such Arizona Tax Lien (after giving effect to all
Losses incurred in connection with the exercise of remedies in respect
thereof, including foreclosure Proceedings, and other costs and expenses of
such redemption, foreclosure, liquidation or other disposition);

(g) any violation of Section 351.151 or Section 351.162 of the Texas Finance
Code with respect to the Acquired Companies place of business located in
Cameron County, Texas;

 

(h) any liability or obligation of BNC to pay any amount in respect of the
ReTax Funding Obligation, after giving effect to the "ReTax Closing Payment"
paid by Encore pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)(ii)_;

(i) that certain Servicing Agreement, dated June 11, 2010, by and between
Propel and Hayman Capital Master Fund, L.P. or that certain Tax Lien Purchase
Agreement, dated May 4, 2012, by and between Propel and Hayman Capital Master
Fund, L.P., or the transactions contemplated by either of such Contracts;

(j) any Proceeding disclosed or required to be disclosed in Section 3.17 of
the Disclosure Schedule;

 

(k) any Tax audit disclosed or required to be disclosed in Section 3.18(b) of
the Disclosure Schedule; and

(l) any and all Taxes imposed on, or pertaining or attributable to any of
the Acquired Companies with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and any and
all Taxes allocated

 



42  to a Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to the terms of _Section 8.2_ and
_Section 8.3_ that have not been paid prior to the Effective Time; provided
that the amount of any payment due under this _Section 7.3(k)_ shall be
reduced by the specific amount of any such Tax set forth as a current
liability on the Reconciliation Statement that has become final and binding
pursuant to _Section 2.4_. 

With respect to Section 7.3(f), after the Effective Time, Encore will cause
Propel to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to collect the amounts due
to Propel pursuant to the Arizona Tax Liens. At the request of the Seller
Representative (which may not be made more frequently than once during each
period of three (3) consecutive months), Encore will inform the Seller
Representative of outstanding balances due on the collections of the Arizona
Tax Liens. To the extent that the Sellers indemnify the Encore Indemnitees for
any Losses pursuant to Section 7.3(f) in connection with the redemption,
foreclosure, liquidation or other disposition of any Arizona Tax Lien, Encore
will cause Propel to assign to the Seller Representative all of Propels
rights in respect of such Arizona Tax Lien, without recourse.

 

With respect to Section 7.3(j), Encore will grant a designee of the Seller
Representative a power of attorney on IRS Form 2848 for purposes of resolving
such disclosed Tax audit; provided, Sellers shall be liable for paying any
amounts that may be due to the IRS at the conclusion of the audit and Sellers
will be entitled to any refunds owing to the taxpayer affected by such Tax
audit.

7.4 _Indemnification by Encore_. From and after the Effective Time,
Encore shall be obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless (including
by reimbursement for Losses) each Seller and its Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the "
_Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against the entirety of any Loss that any
Seller Indemnitee may suffer that results from, arises out of, relates to, is
in the nature of, or is caused by, any one or more of the following:

 

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in
_Article 5_ or in any certificate or instrument delivered at the Closing by
or on behalf of Encore (or any allegation by a third party that, if true,
would constitute such a breach or inaccuracy);

 

(b) any breach or non-performance by Encore of any covenant, agreement or
undertaking contained in this Agreement; and

(c) any matter arising out of the operation of the Business after the
Effective Time.

7.5 _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

 

(a) _Notice_. If any third party (including any Taxing Authority) shall make
or assert a claim against any party entitled to indemnification hereunder
(the " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any matter that may give rise to
a claim for indemnification against a party required to provide
indemnification under this _Article 7_ (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), then
the Indemnified Party shall notify each Indemnifying Party thereof promptly;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in
notifying any Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any liability or obligation under this Agreement unless (and then solely to
the extent) the Indemnifying Party is damaged or prejudiced thereby.

 

(b) _Defense and Settlement of Claims_. In the case of any such claim pursuant
to which only the recovery of a sum of money is being sought and the
Indemnifying Party enters into an agreement with the Indemnified Party (in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) pursuant
to which the Indemnifying Party agrees to be fully responsible (with no
reservation of any rights other than the right to be subrogated to the rights
of the Indemnified Party) for all Losses relating to such claim, the
Indemnifying Party may, by 

 



43  giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, assume the defense thereof.
In such case, (i) the Indemnifying Party will defend the Indemnified Party
against such matter with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party, subject to approval of an insurance company providing
coverage for the Losses, if any, and (ii) the Indemnified Party may retain
separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense (except that the
Indemnifying Party will be responsible for the fees and expenses of any
separate counsel to the Indemnified Party incurred prior to the date upon
which the Indemnifying Party effectively assumes control of such defense). In
the event that the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to, or does not, assume
control of the defense of a claim pursuant to the terms of this _Section
7.5(b)_, the Indemnifying Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole
cost and expense to participate in such defense and, in any event, the
Indemnified Party shall (A) provide the Indemnifying Party with all material
information requested by such party relating to the defense of such claim, (B)
confer with the Indemnifying Party as to the most cost-effective manner in
which to defend such claim and (C) use its reasonable efforts to minimize the
cost of defending such claim. The Indemnified Party will not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such
matter without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be
withheld unreasonably), and the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such
matter without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be
withheld unreasonably). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Party
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a claim
may adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary
damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party,
assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such claim, but
the Indemnifying Party will not be bound by any determination of any claim so
defended for the purposes of this Agreement or any compromise or settlement
effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably withheld).

7.6 _Limitations on Liability_.

 

(a) _Basket_.

 

(i) The Encore Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under

_Threshold Amount_ "), at which time the Encore Indemnitees shall be entitled
to indemnification for all such Losses to the first dollar without reduction
by the Threshold Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that the limitation set

3.7_ (Capitalization), _Section 3.12_ (Receivables), _Section 3.15_
(Employee Benefits), _Section 3.16_ (Legal Compliance; Permits),  _Section

Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification for all such Losses to the
first dollar without reduction by the Threshold Amount; _provided_ , _however_
, that 

 



44  the limitation set forth in this _Section 7.6(a)(ii)_ shall not be
applicable to any Losses resulting from fraud.

 

(b) _Cap_. The aggregate liability of the Sellers to the Encore Indemnitees
pursuant to  _Section 7.3(a)_ and _Section 7.3(b)_ shall not exceed

to $10,000,000 multiplied by such Sellers Percentage Interest) and the
aggregate liability of Encore to the Seller Indemnitees pursuant to _Section
7.4(a)_ shall not exceed $10,000,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
limitations set forth in this _Section 7.6(b)_ shall not be applicable to
any Losses resulting from either (i) fraud or (ii) any breach or inaccuracy
(or any allegation by a third party that, if true, would constitute a breach
or inaccuracy) of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section
3.7_ (Capitalization), _Section 3.12_ (Receivables), _Section 3.15_
(Employee Benefits), _Section 3.16_ (Legal Compliance; Permits),  _Section
3.18_ (Taxes) or _Section 4.7_ (Title to Securities).

(c)  _Limited Liability of the Sellers_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, a Seller shall not be liable to the Encore
Indemnitees for:

 

(i) any Losses that any Encore Indemnitee may suffer as a result of any matter
described in  _Section 7.3(b)_ or _Section 7.3(c) _to the extent that such
matter relates to (A) the breach or inaccuracy of the representations and
warranties made by or on behalf of any Seller other than such Seller or (B)
the breach or non-performance by any Seller other than such Seller of any
covenant, agreement or undertaking contained in this Agreement; or

(ii) the portion of any Losses that any Encore Indemnitee may suffer as a
result of any matter described in _Section 7.3(a)_, _Section 7.3(d)_,
_Section 7.3(e)_,  _Section 7.3(f)_, _Section 7.3(g)_, _Section 7.3(h)_,
_Section 7.3(i)_, _Section 7.3(j)_ or _Section 7.3(k)_ that are in excess
of the amount of such Losses multiplied by (A) with respect to any such
Losses (or any portion thereof) that are clearly attributable solely to Propel
and/or BNC, on the one hand, or solely to RPV and/or RPH, on the other hand,
such Sellers ownership beneficial interest in such Acquired Companies as
provided in _Table 7.6(c)(ii)(A)_ below, or (B) with respect to all other such
Losses (or any portion thereof), such Sellers Percentage Interest.

(d) _Disclaimer of Special Damages_. Each Party waives any rights to assert
or receive any indirect, consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages
suffered or incurred by such Party as a result of the breach by another Party
of any of its representations, warranties or obligations hereunder. For
purposes of the foregoing, actual damages may, however, include indirect,

the injuries or losses resulting in or giving rise to such damages are
incurred or suffered 

 



45  by a third party that is not an Indemnified Party or an Affiliate of any
Indemnified Party and (b) such damages are required to be paid by an
Indemnified Party to a third party.

 

7.7 _Procedures for Assertion of Claims_.

 

(a) _Claim Certificate_. In connection with any claim (including any Tax
claim) for reimbursement of Losses subject to indemnification under this
_Article 7_ , including any Losses attributable to matters subject to _Section
7.5_ that are not paid by an Indemnifying Party directly to third parties, the
Party seeking reimbursement (the " _Claimant_ ") shall prepare, and deliver
to the party from which reimbursement is sought (the " _Respondent_ "), a
certificate (a " _Claim Certificate_ "): (i) stating that the Claimant has
paid or sustained Losses subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Article
7_ and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the Loss included in the amount so
stated.

 

(b) _Resolution of Claims_. As soon as practicable following the delivery of a
Claim Certificate, the Seller Representative and Encore shall attempt to
agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each claim set
forth therein. If the Seller Representative and Encore should so agree, a
written memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed
by the Seller Representative and Encore, and a copy of such memorandum shall
be delivered to the Claimant and the Respondent. Such memorandum and the
agreements contained therein shall be final and binding on the Seller
Representative, Encore, the Claimant, the Respondent and all other Persons
having any interest therein.

(c) _Failure to Resolve Objections_. If the Seller Representative and Encore
cannot agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of
the claims in a Claim Certificate within thirty (30) days after delivery of
the Claim Certificate (as such period may be extended only by mutual written
agreement of the Seller Representative and Encore, by giving notice thereof to
the Claimant and the Respondent), the Claimant may pursue any and all legal
remedies that may be available to it.

(d) _Entitlement to Indemnity_. The Claimant shall be entitled to receive
payment for all amounts that the Respondent (i) has agreed in writing to pay,
(ii) is obligated to pay pursuant to a written memorandum between the Seller
Representative and Encore pursuant to _Section 7.7(b)_ or (iii) has been
found liable to pay pursuant to a final order of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

 

(e) _Payment of Claims_. The Respondent shall pay all amounts to which a
Claimant is entitled promptly upon demand of the Claimant by certified check
or wire transfer of immediately available funds, as the Claimant may specify.

7.8 _Recourse to Holdback_. For so long as the Escrow Agreement is in full
force and effect and to the extent that sufficient funds are held in the
escrow account governed by the Escrow Agreement, an Encore Indemnitee shall
make a claim first against the Holdback in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement for reimbursement of any amount that an Encore Indemnitee is
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 7.7(d)_, and only to the
extent that such entitlement is not satisfied from the Holdback will such
Encore Indemnitee be entitled to a direct payment pursuant to _Section
7.7(e)_.

7.9 _Insurance_. Effective as of the Effective Time, Encore will obtain an
errors and omissions tail insurance policy with respect to the conduct of the
Business by the Acquired Companies prior to the Effective Time (the " _Tail
Policy_ "). The Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), within ten
(10) Business Days after receiving from an Encore Indemnitee a notice of third
party claim 

 



46  given pursuant to _Section 7.5(a)_ or a Claim Certificate given pursuant to
_Section 7.7(a)_, shall have the right to require Encore to make a claim
under the Tail Policy with respect to the claim described in such notice of
third party claim or Claim Certificate by providing to Encore (a) a notice of
claim election under this _Section 7.9_ and (b) reimbursement of Encore, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, by the Seller Representative or
the Sellers of the amount of the premium paid by Encore for the Tail Policy
(the amount of which shall be disclosed by Encore to the Seller Representative
at or prior to the Closing), unless such premium shall have been previously
reimbursed to Encore in connection with a prior claim. Upon Encores receipt
of such notice of claim election and reimbursement, Encore shall make a claim
under the Tail Policy with respect to the claim described in such notice of
third party claim or Claim Certificate on a prompt basis in the manner
required by the insurance carrier. Encore shall diligently pursue each claim
so made under the Tail Policy and the Sellers and Encore shall each use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with one another and the
insurance carrier in the prosecution of each such claim. In the event that
Encore receives insurance proceeds under the Tail Policy with respect to
Losses for which an Encore Indemnitee has made an indemnification claim prior
to the date on which the Sellers are required pursuant to this _Article 7_ to
pay such indemnification claim, the indemnification claim shall be reduced by
an amount equal to such insurance proceeds actually received by Encore (after
giving effect to any applicable deductibles), less all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs incurred by Encore in obtaining such insurance proceeds. If such
insurance proceeds are received by Encore after the date on which the Sellers
paid the Encore Indemnitee for an indemnification claim, Encore shall, no
later than ten (10) days after the receipt of such insurance proceeds,
reimburse the Sellers in an amount equal to such insurance proceeds actually
received by Encore (after giving effect to any applicable deductibles), less
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by Encore in obtaining such
insurance proceeds, but in no event in an amount greater than the Losses paid
to the Encore Indemnitee by the Sellers.

7.10 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for claims for specific performance of the
terms of this Agreement or claims based upon fraud, the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _Article 7_ will be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Indemnified Parties with respect to any and all claims from and after
the Effective Time relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 8

 

TAX MATTERS

8.1 _Income Tax Treatment of the Purchase Transaction_. In accordance with
Situation 2 of Rev. Rul. 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432, the Parties agree to treat the
purchase of the Purchased Securities from the Sellers by Encore for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes (and for all applicable foreign, state and local
income Tax purposes to the extent permitted thereunder) in the following
manner: (a) with respect to the Sellers, as if the Sellers sold their
respective partnership interests in each of Propel, BNC, RPV and RPH to Encore
and (b) with respect to Encore, as if each Acquired Company distributed all of
its assets (subject to its liabilities) to the Sellers in liquidation of
their respective partnership interests in the Acquired Companies, immediately
followed by the purchase by Encore from each Seller of the undivided interests
in the assets of each Acquired Company deemed distributed to such Seller
(subject to such Sellers share of each such Acquired Companys liabilities).

8.2 _Preparation of Tax Returns_. 

(a) _In General_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 8.2(b)_, and
with respect to each Tax Return covering either (i) a Tax period or year
commencing at or before and ending after the Effective Time (each, a "
_Straddle Period_ ") or (ii) a Tax period ending at or before the Effective
Time or a portion of any Straddle Period that ends at and includes the
Effective Time (each, a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ ") that, in any such case,
is required to be filed for, by, on behalf of or with respect to any Acquired
Company after the Effective Time, Encore (A) shall

 



47  prepare or cause to be prepared each such Tax Return and (B) shall determine
the portion of the Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return that is allocable to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion of the Taxes shown as due on such
Tax Return that is allocable to the Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning
after the Effective Time (each, a " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ "), which
determination shall be set forth in a statement (" _Statement_ ") prepared by
Encore. Encore shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return and the Statement
related thereto (including related work papers) to the Seller Representative
for its review and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) sufficiently in advance of the due date (including any
extensions thereof) for filing such Tax Return to provide the Seller
Representative with a meaningful opportunity to analyze and comment on such
Tax Return and have such Tax Return modified before the filing of such Tax
Return. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the form and substance of such Tax
Return will be determined in the sole discretion of Encore. With respect to
each Tax Return described in this _Section 8.2(a)_ and in _Section 8.2(b)_,
Encore and each Seller, as applicable, will join in the execution and filing
of such Tax Return and other documentation as required by applicable Law.

 

(b) _Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns_. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of  _Section 8.2(a)_, the Seller Representative shall cause to be timely
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice, applicable Law and this
Agreement all Tax Returns for income Taxes with respect to the Acquired
Companies for all taxable periods ending at or before the Effective Time that
are due after the Effective Time, including for those jurisdictions and Taxing
Authorities that permit or require a short period Tax Return for income Taxes
for the period ending at and including the Effective Time (including an IRS
Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income, for each of Propel, BNC, RPV and
RPH covering the taxable period beginning on January 1, 2012, and ending at
and including the Effective Time. The Sellers shall bear the costs of the
preparation of all such Tax Returns. The Seller Representative shall provide
Encore with copies of completed drafts of each such Tax Return at least forty-
five (45) days prior to the due date (including extensions) for filing
thereof, along with supporting workpapers, for Encores review and approval.
Within twenty-five (25) days of such delivery, Encore shall deliver to the
Seller Representative a written statement describing any objections to such
Tax Return. If the Seller Representative and Encore are unable to resolve any
such objection within the twenty (20) day period after the delivery of such
objections, such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by the
Seller Representative, as adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the
resolution of any such objections mutually agreed to by the Seller
Representative and Encore, and any remaining objections shall be submitted to
the Independent Accounting Firm for resolution in accordance with the
procedures set forth in _Section 2.4(d)_ and, if necessary to reflect such
resolution, the Parties shall cause such Tax Return to be amended and filed
with the appropriate Taxing Authority.

 

8.3 _Straddle Period Allocation_. Except as otherwise provided in the next
sentence, in the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes
allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period portion of such Straddle Period shall
be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business at the Effective Time. In the case of any liability for any real or
personal property Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period, the total amount of
such Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period
shall be the product of (a) such Tax for the entirety of such Straddle
Period, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
days for such Straddle Period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period, and
the balance of such Taxes shall be allocable to the Post-Closing Tax Period.

 



48 8.4 _Transfer Taxes_. All documentary, sales, use, registration and other
transfer Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer or securities
transfer Taxes) and fees incurred in connection with the Purchase Transaction
or this Agreement shall be paid by the Sellers.

 

8.5 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by any other Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns, and in connection with any audit or Proceeding,
including making employees available on a mutually convenient basis in
connection therewith. Upon request by Encore, the Sellers shall deliver to
Encore originals or copies of all books and records within the Sellers
control with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Companies
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. The Parties agree to use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Taxing Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce
or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on any Party as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

8.6 _Conflict_. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this
_Article 8_ and any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this
_Article 8_ shall control.

8.7 _Survival; Exclusivity_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, each Partys representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements, rights and obligations with respect to any Tax or Tax matter
covered by this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall not terminate
until thirty (30) days after the expiration of all statutes of limitations
(including any and all extensions thereof) applicable to such Tax (or the
assessment thereof) or Tax matter.

8.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. The Parties agree to treat any
indemnity payment made pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign income Tax purposes.

 

8.9 _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. The Sellers shall cause any and
all Tax sharing or allocation agreements, intercompany agreements or other
agreements or arrangements between or among one or more of the Acquired
Companies and any one or more other Persons relating to any Tax matters to be
terminated with respect to each of the Acquired Companies as of the Effective
Time, and from and after the Effective Time, the Acquired Companies shall not
be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder for any taxable period
(whether past, current or future taxable periods).

 

ARTICLE 9

including demanding and/or participating in arbitration proceedings with
respect to such disputes and complying with any Orders issued in connection

which agreements shall have the effect of binding such Sellers as if such
Sellers had personally entered into such agreements; and

 

(h) do all other things and take all other actions under or related to this
Agreement that the Seller Representative may consider necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Seller Representative to accomplish the
foregoing or for the accomplishment of any other action required by the terms

provided for in _Section 2.5_ and _Article 8_ ) and to otherwise effectuate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

This appointment and power of attorney shall be deemed coupled with an
interest and all authority conferred hereby shall be irrevocable and shall not
be subject to termination by operation of law, whether by the death or
incapacity or liquidation or dissolution of any Seller or the occurrence of
any other event or events, and the Seller Representative may not terminate

successors or assigns without the consent of Encore. No bond shall be

be authorized to engage, and to rely upon the advice and opinions of, legal
counsel, accountants or other administrative or professional advisors as the
Seller Representative may deem advisable to carry out its duties under this

omitted hereunder as the Seller Representative while acting in good faith and
in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted pursuant
to the advice of legal counsel, accountants or other administrative or
professional advisors shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. Each
Seller

 



50  agrees to hold the Seller Representative harmless from any loss, damage,
liability or expense (including fees and disbursements of legal counsel,
accountants and other professional advisors) that such Seller may sustain as
a result of any action taken in good faith by the Seller Representative in

connection with any dispute arising between the Sellers and Encore under this
Agreement.

agrees to reimburse the Seller Representative for such Sellers pro-rata
share (based on the Sellers relative Percentage Interests) of any out-of-
pocket administrative fees, costs and expenses (including fees and
disbursements of legal counsel, accountants and other professional advisors)
reasonably incurred by the Seller Representative in connection with the
administration of its duties under this Agreement. Each Seller also hereby
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Representative from and
against such Sellers pro-rata share (based on the Sellers relative
Percentage Interests) of any other loss, damage, liability or expense
(including fees and disbursements of legal counsel, accountants and
other professional advisors) that the Seller Representative may sustain as a
result of any action taken by the Seller Representative without gross
negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith in connection with the
administration of its duties under this Agreement or in connection with any
dispute arising between the Sellers and Encore under this Agreement.

10.8 _W AIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.

(a)  _W AIVER_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY

breached any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or
covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) that the Party has not breached shall not detract from
or mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach of the first representation,
warranty or covenant.

breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this
Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any
court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the
Parties and the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be
entitled, at law or in equity.

10.16 _Offset Permitted_. Encore shall have the right to set off against any
of its obligations (or the obligations of any of its Affiliates) to make
payment to any Seller, under this Agreement or otherwise, any amount owed to
Encore (or to any of its Affiliates) by such Seller (or by any of its
Affiliates) under this Agreement or otherwise.

10.17 _Directly or Indirectly_. Where any provision in this Agreement refers

_{Signature Page to Securities Purchase Agreement}_ _PARENT GUARANTEE_

 

Encore Capital Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Guarantor_ "),
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to each of McCombs Family
Partners, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership, JHBC Holdings, LLC, a Texas
limited liability company, and Texas Tax Loans, LLC, a Texas limited liability
company doing business as Rio Tax Loans (collectively, the " _Beneficiaries_
"), the full payment and the punctual and faithful performance and observance
of the representations, warranties, covenants, liabilities and obligations of
Propel Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned
subsidiary of the Guarantor (" _Encore_ "), set forth in or arising under that
certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of May 8, 2012 (the "
_Purchase Agreement_ "), by and among Encore and the Beneficiaries (such
representations, warranties, covenants, liabilities and obligations of Encore,
collectively, the " _Guaranteed Obligations_ "). This Parent Guarantee is
expressly limited to the Guaranteed Obligations.

This Parent Guarantee shall become effective upon the execution hereof by the
Guarantor and shall continue in full force and effect until the Guaranteed
Obligations have been completely and indefeasibly paid and performed. This
Parent Guarantee is a primary obligation of the Guarantor and is an absolute
and unconditional guarantee of payment and performance that shall remain in
full force and effect without respect to future changes in conditions. Each of
the Beneficiaries shall have direct recourse against the Guarantor with
respect to the Guaranteed Obligations. The obligations of the Guarantor
hereunder are independent of the obligations of Encore, and the Guarantor
agrees that a separate action may be brought against the Guarantor in respect
of the Guaranteed Obligations. The Guarantors liability hereunder shall be
immediate and shall not be contingent upon the exercise or enforcement by any
of the Beneficiaries of whatever remedies they may have against Encore under
the Purchase Agreement. The Guarantor waives any defense arising by reason of
any insolvency, dissolution or lack of power and authority of Encore.

This Parent Guarantee will be governed by and construed in accordance with
the domestic laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any
choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of
New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. This Parent
Guarantee constitutes the entire agreement among the Guarantor and the
Beneficiaries and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements,
or representations by or among the Guarantor and the Beneficiaries, written
or oral (including that certain letter agreement, dated February 28, 2012, by
and among the Guarantor, Propel Financial Services, LLC, BNC Retax, LLC and
RioProp Ventures, LLC), that may have related in any way to the subject
matter hereof. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Parent
Guarantee will be valid unless it is in writing and signed by the Guarantor
and each Beneficiary.
