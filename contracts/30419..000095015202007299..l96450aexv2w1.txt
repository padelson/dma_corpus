STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT   THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of
September 21, 2002 (this "AGREEMENT"), is made and entered into by and
between Sprint Corporation, a Kansas corporation ("SPRINT"), Centel
Directories LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("CENTEL LLC") ( Sprint
and Centel LLC are collectively referred to in this Agreement as "SELLERS"),
and R.H. Donnelley Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("BUYER").  
RECITALS   1. Sprint owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock (the "DAI SHARES") of DirectoriesAmerica, Inc., a Kansas
corporation ("DAI"), which owns all of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of Sprint Publishing and Advertising, Inc., a Kansas corporation
("SPA").   2. Centel LLC owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of
capital stock (the "CDC SHARES" and, collectively with the DAI Shares, the
"SHARES") of Centel Directory Company, a Delaware corporation ("CDC"), which
owns a membership interest in Cendon, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability
company ("CENDON") (DAI, SPA and CDC are hereinafter each referred to as a
"WHOLLY OWNED COMPANY" and collectively referred to as the "WHOLLY OWNED
Companies", and DAI, SPA, CDC and Cendon are hereinafter each referred to as
a "COMPANY" and collectively referred to as the "COMPANIES").   3. Pursuant
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Sellers desire to sell to
Buyer, and Buyer desires to purchase from Sellers, the Shares.   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound by this Agreement, the
parties agree as follows:       ARTICLE I   PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE
SHARES    SECTION 1.1 PURCHASE AND SALE. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the closing provided for in
Section 1.5 of this Agreement (the "CLOSING"), Sellers agree to sell,
transfer and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase, acquire and
accept from Sellers, the Shares.   SECTION 1.2 PAYMENT OF PURCHASE
PRICE.   (a) In consideration for the sale, transfer and delivery of the
Shares, at the Closing Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
Sellers (or to such third parties as may be designated in writing by Sellers)
the Estimated Purchase Price in accordance with Section 1.2(d). The
"ESTIMATED PURCHASE Price" payable at Closing shall equal (i) Two Billion Two
Hundred Thirty Million Dollars ($2,230,000,000) and (ii) (A) plus an amount
equal to the difference between the Estimated Working Capital and the Target
Working Capital if the amount of Estimated Working Capital is greater than
the Target Working Capital, or (B) less an amount equal to the difference
between the Target Working Capital and the Estimated Working Capital if the
amount of Estimated Working Capital is less than the Target Working
Capital.   (b) At least five business days prior to the Closing, Sellers
shall deliver to Buyer an estimated combined consolidated balance sheet of
the Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Principles (as hereinafter defined) and a
certificate setting forth the Estimated Working Capital based on such balance
sheet. For the purposes of this Agreement, "ESTIMATED WORKING CAPITAL" shall
mean the good faith, best estimate of Sellers of the book value of the
Current Assets (as defined in Section 1.3) of the Companies less the book
value of the Current Liabilities (as defined in     -2-   Section 1.3)
of the Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date as reflected
on such balance sheet.   (c) Within five business days after the
determination of the Final Balance Sheet (as hereinafter defined) in
accordance with Section 1.4 of this Agreement, (i) if the amount of the
Closing Date Working Capital calculated in accordance with Section 1.4 is
less than the Estimated Working Capital, then Sellers shall pay to Buyer an
amount equal to the difference between the Estimated Working Capital and the
Closing Date Working Capital plus interest or (ii) if the amount of the
Closing Date Working Capital calculated in accordance with Section 1.4 is
greater than the Estimated Working Capital, Buyer shall pay to Sellers an
amount equal to the difference between the Closing Date Working Capital and
the Estimated Working Capital, plus interest. Any interest on such payments
shall be calculated using the prime rate of interest (as published in the
"Money Rates" table of the Eastern U.S. Edition of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL on
the Closing Date) and shall begin on the Closing Date (as
hereinafter defined) and end on the date of any such payment.   (d) All
payments required under this Section 1.2 shall be made in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available federal funds to such bank account(s) as
shall be designated in writing by the recipient at least three business
days prior to the Closing or promptly upon the determination of the Final
Balance Sheet, as the case may be. The net amount of all payments received by
Sellers under this Section 1.2 is referred to in this Agreement as the
"PURCHASE Price."       -3-    SECTION 1.3 TARGET WORKING CAPITAL.
"TARGET WORKING CAPITAL" shall equal $259,548,000, which represents the book
value of those categories of current assets of the Companies listed on
SCHEDULE 1.3 (the "CURRENT ASSETS") less the book value of those categories
of current liabilities of the Companies listed on SCHEDULE 1.3 (the "CURRENT
LIABILITIES"), in each case as reflected on the audited combined consolidated
balance sheet of the Companies as of December 31, 2001 (the "YEAR-END BALANCE
SHEET").   SECTION 1.4 ADJUSTMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE.   (a) For purposes of
this Agreement, the "CLOSING DATE WORKING CAPITAL" shall mean the book value
of the Current Assets less the book value of the Current Liabilities as
reflected on the Final Balance Sheet. Closing Date Working Capital shall not
include deferred directory costs, deferred revenue, any asset or liability
related to Taxes or any intercompany accounts settled pursuant to Section
5.22.   (b) Promptly following the Closing, Buyer shall prepare a
combined consolidated balance sheet of the Companies as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (the "PRELIMINARY BALANCE SHEET"), in accordance
with the Accounting Principles. "ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES" means generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") on a basis consistent with the Year-
End Balance Sheet and using the same policies and procedures as were used to
prepare the Year-End Balance Sheet. Buyer shall engage PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP (the "BUYER\'S AUDITOR") to conduct an audit of the Preliminary Balance
Sheet. Buyer shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to
Sellers a final draft of the Preliminary Balance Sheet within 90 days after
the Closing Date, together with the opinion of the Buyer\'s Auditor thereon
stating that the audit has been conducted in accordance with the Accounting
Principles. Representatives of Sellers shall have the opportunity to examine
the work papers, schedules and        -4-   other documents prepared
by Buyer in connection with the preparation of the Preliminary Balance Sheet.
Buyer shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Buyer\'s
Auditor to permit Sellers and their accounting firm (the "SELLERS\' AUDITOR")
to examine the Buyer\'s Auditor\'s work papers used in connection with its
audit of the Preliminary Balance Sheet. Buyer shall be responsible for the
fees and expenses of the Buyer Auditor, and Sellers shall be responsible for
the fees and expenses of the Sellers\' Auditor.   (c) If Sellers object to
the Preliminary Balance Sheet, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer a written
notice of objection (an "OBJECTION NOTICE") within thirty (30) days following
the delivery thereof. If Sellers have no objection to the Preliminary Balance
Sheet, Sellers shall promptly deliver to Buyer a written notice of acceptance
(an "ACCEPTANCE NOTICE"). The Preliminary Balance Sheet shall be final and
binding on the parties if an Acceptance Notice is delivered or if no
Objection Notice is delivered to Buyer within such 30-day period. Any payment
or portion of any payment required under Section 1.2 not subject to the
Objection Notice, shall be paid within five business days following the
delivery of the Objection Notice. Any Objection Notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the disputed items on the Preliminary Balance Sheet and
shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for the objection and
all information in the possession of Sellers which forms the basis of the
objection, as well as the amount in dispute. If an Objection Notice is given,
the parties shall consult with each other with respect to the objection. If
the parties are unable to reach agreement within thirty (30) days after an
Objection Notice has been given, any unresolved disputed items shall be
promptly referred to KPMG; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if KPMG declines to accept
such appointment then the parties shall mutually agree upon another
nationally recognized independent accounting firm that has not provided
material services to either party during the previous two years (the
"UNRELATED        -5-   ACCOUNTING FIRM"). The Unrelated Accounting
Firm shall be directed to resolve disputed issues in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and render a written report on the unresolved
disputed issues with respect to the Preliminary Balance Sheet as promptly as
practicable and to resolve only those issues of dispute set forth in the
Objection Notice. The resolution of the dispute by the Unrelated Accounting
Firm shall be final and binding on the parties. The fees and expenses of the
Unrelated Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Sellers, on the one hand,
and Buyer, on the other hand. The Preliminary Balance Sheet as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 1.4(c) is referred to in this Agreement
as the "FINAL BALANCE SHEET".   SECTION 1.5 CLOSING. The Closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall take place on the later to
occur of (a) January 3, 2003 and  (b) the fifth business day following the
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to Closing set forth in
Article VI of this Agreement that are capable of being satisfied prior to the
Closing Date, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the offices of King and Spalding,
1185 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036, or on such other date and at
such other time or place as the parties may agree. However, if the prior
sentence would require the Closing to occur prior to January 30, 2003, Buyer
may elect to defer the Closing to a date on or prior to January 30, 2003. The
date of the Closing is sometimes referred to in this Agreement as the
"CLOSING DATE."   SECTION 1.6 DELIVERIES BY SELLERS. At the Closing, Sellers
will deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer (unless delivered previously)
the following:   (a) The stock certificates representing all of the Shares,
duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock powers duly executed in
blank;       -6-    (b) The resignations of all officers and members
of the Boards of Directors of the Wholly Owned Companies and the managers of
Cendon, in each case from their position as such, in a form reasonably

hereinafter defined), the Directory Services License Agreement (as
hereinafter defined), the Mutual Release (as hereinafter defined), the Non-
Competition Agreement (as hereinafter defined), the Subscriber Listings
Agreement (as hereinafter defined), the Trademark License Agreement (as
hereinafter defined), the Publisher Trademark License Agreement (as
hereinafter defined) and the SPV Agreement (as hereinafter defined), each
executed by Sprint and/or the applicable subsidiary of Sprint (the "ANCILLARY
AGREEMENTS"); and   (d) All other documents, instruments and writings
reasonably required by Buyer to be delivered by Sellers at or prior to the
Closing pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise reasonably required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION
1.7 DELIVERIES BY BUYER. At the Closing, Buyer will deliver or cause to be
delivered to Sellers (unless previously delivered) the following:   (a) The
Estimated Purchase Price in accordance with Section 1.2(a) of this
Agreement;   (b) The Ancillary Agreements, each executed by Buyer or
the Companies, as applicable; and   (c) All other documents, instruments
and writings reasonably required by Sellers to be delivered by the Buyer at
or prior to the Closing pursuant to this Agreement or      
-7-   otherwise reasonably required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 1.8 INITIAL AND SECOND
CLOSING.   (a) In the event that (i) at any time after the date hereof
the only conditions to Closing capable of being satisfied prior to the
Closing Date that have not been satisfied are Section 6.1(d) and/or Section
6.2(d) as a result of an action or, with respect to Section 6.1(d), failure
to act by one or more state public utilities commissions or other state
governmental or regulatory authorities and (ii) the directories published by
the Companies in the state or states with respect to which such regulatory
action has occurred or, with respect to Section 6.1(d), has failed to occur
(the "EXCLUDED STATES") represent less than eight percent (8%) of the 2001
revenues of the Companies, as set forth on SCHEDULE 1.8(a) (the inclusion in
this Section 1.8 of this percentage is not deemed to be an admission or
representation by any party that this percentage of revenues is or is not
"material" or would or could have a "material adverse effect" as contemplated
by this Agreement), the parties will complete an initial Closing (the
"INITIAL CLOSING") in accordance with this Agreement (including this Section
1.8) on the later to occur of (i) January 3, 2003, and (ii) the fifth
business day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to
Closing set forth in Article VI of this Agreement that are capable of being
satisfied prior to the Closing Date (other than Sections 6.1(d) and 6.2(d)).
However, if the prior sentence would require the Initial Closing to occur
prior to January 30, 2003, Buyer may elect to defer the Initial Closing to a
date on or prior to January 30, 2003.   (b) Immediately prior to the Initial
Closing, (i) the Companies will contribute to one or more newly formed
corporate or limited liability company subsidiaries (each, a "STATE
SUBSIDIARY") those assets listed on SCHEDULE 1.8(b) relating to the
directories        -8-   publishing business conducted by the
Companies in each Excluded State as of the date of the Initial Closing (the
"EXCLUDED BUSINESS"), (ii) each State Subsidiary will assume the liabilities
listed on SCHEDULE 1.8(b) relating to the Excluded Business in its respective
Excluded State, and (iii) all of the common stock or membership interests of
the State Subsidiary will be distributed to DAI or Centel LLC, as applicable,
pursuant to Sections 332 and 337 of the Code and thereafter, prior to the
Second Closing Termination Date, Sellers will not take any action that would
cause Centel LLC or DAI to no longer be part of their consolidated group for
federal tax purposes. The respective assets and liabilities relating to the
Excluded Business conducted in each Excluded State will be contributed to and
assumed by a separate State Subsidiary. If required, the Parties will cause
CenDon to make a non-cash, non-liquidating distribution of the common stock
or membership interest of the State Subsidiary to CDC.   (c) In the event
that following the Initial Closing and prior to the termination of this
Agreement, the conditions to closing set forth in Section 6.1(d) and Section
6.2(d) become satisfied (or waived) as to one or more Excluded States, the
parties will complete a subsequent Closing (the "SECOND Closing") at which
Sellers will sell to Buyer the shares or membership interests (as applicable)
of the applicable State Subsidiary(ies) as to which the conditions in Section
6.1(d) and Section 6.2(d) have been satisfied (or waived). The Second Closing
will take place on such date as is agreed to by the parties but in no event
later than the business day prior to the one year anniversary of the date of
this Agreement (the "SECOND CLOSING TERMINATION DATE"), assuming that all
conditions to Closing have been satisfied as of such date (other than Section
6.1(d) or 6.2(d) with respect to any states that are not included in
the Initial Closing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the conditions to
the Closing in Section 6.1(d) or Section 6.2(d) have not been satisfied at
the Initial Closing as to more than one       -9-   Excluded State,
the Second Closing will occur within five business days of the satisfaction
or waiver of all conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI of this
Agreement that are capable of being satisfied prior to the Closing
Date, including without limitation Sections 6.1(d) and 6.2(d), as to each of
the Excluded States; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if, on the Second Closing
Termination Date, the conditions in Sections 6.1(d) and 6.2(d) have not been
satisfied as to any Excluded State, such Excluded State will not be the
subject of a Second Closing.   (d) For the purposes of the Initial Closing
and the Second Closing, (i) the dollar amount indicated in the second
sentence of Section 1.2(a) shall equal $2,230,000,000 TIMES the Applicable
Fraction (as defined below) and (ii) the Target Working Capital shall equal
$259,548,000 TIMES the Applicable Fraction. The "Applicable Fraction" means a
fraction, the numerator of which is the revenues reflected on SCHEDULE 1.8(a)
for the states with respect to which the business is being transferred at the
Initial Closing or Second Closing (as applicable) and the denominator of
which is the total revenues reflected on SCHEDULE 1.8(a).   (e) At the
Initial Closing, the DAI Shares will be retained by Sprint, and Buyer will
purchase the CDC Shares and all of the issued and outstanding capital stock
of SPA (which, together with the CDC Shares, will constitute the "Shares" for
purposes of the Initial Closing). Prior to the Initial Closing, the parties
will enter into an amendment to this Agreement that reflects the provisions
of this Section 1.8 and otherwise causes the economic and legal substance of
this Agreement to be retained and implemented with respect to the Initial
Closing and the Second Closing, including without limitation to (i) remove
DAI from the definition of "Companies" and include DAI in the definition of
"Sellers", (ii) deem the State Subsidiaries to be "Companies" and "Wholly
Owned Companies" for purposes of this Agreement and (iii) deem the word
"Closing" to include the Second Closing. Notwithstanding       
-10-   the foregoing, at the Initial Closing, the provisions of Section
5.14 and Section 5.7 will apply without amendment except as set forth in
clauses (i) and (ii) above. Following the Initial Closing, this Agreement as
so amended will remain in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms.   (f) After the Initial Closing, the Companies will manage
and operate the Excluded Business on behalf of Sellers pursuant to the
Services Agreement (as defined below), including (without limitation) by
performing national and local sales, billing, credit and collection, customer
service, pre-press, printing and distribution. All gross revenues of the
Excluded Business will be collected by the Companies on behalf of Sellers and
promptly transferred to Sellers. For each Excluded State (for so long as such
Excluded State is subject to the Services Agreement), Sellers will pay the
Companies a fee for the performance of such services for each fiscal year
equal to 39% of the net billed revenue of the Excluded Business in the
Excluded State for such fiscal year PLUS 110% of direct costs for printing,
paper procurement and distribution for such Excluded Business for such fiscal
year. The fee shall be prorated on a daily basis for any partial year during
which the Services Agreement is in effect with respect to the Excluded
Business in the applicable Excluded State. In connection with the Initial
Closing, Sellers and the Companies will enter into a 50-year services
agreement (the "SERVICES AGREEMENT") with respect to the Excluded Businesses
to implement and reflect the provision of services and payment of fees for
performance described in this Section 1.8(f) and otherwise containing
substantially the same terms and conditions as are contained in the Directory
Services License Agreement. The Services Agreement will terminate upon the
Second Closing as to any Excluded Business acquired by Buyer in the Second
Closing.      -11-     (g) If, at any time following the Second
Closing Termination Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms following the Initial Closing, Sellers determine to sell any
of the State Subsidiary(ies) or all or any portion of the Excluded Business
that has not been the subject of a Second Closing, Sellers will give notice
to the Companies of such intent and request the Companies to submit a written
proposal to Sellers outlining the specific terms and conditions under which
the Companies are willing to purchase such State Subsidiary(ies) or the
applicable portion of the Excluded Business (the "TARGET ASSETS"), which the
Companies will submit within thirty (30) days following Sellers\' request if
the Company desires to pursue such opportunity. If the Companies do not
submit a proposal within such 30-day period, Sellers may contract with a
third party in Sellers\' discretion to purchase the Target Assets. If the
Companies submit a proposal during such 30-day period, Sellers will negotiate
in good faith with the Companies for a period of thirty (30) days following
the receipt by Sellers of such proposal to agree on terms and conditions
under which the Companies would acquire the Target Assets. If no agreement
has been reached by the end of the 30-day period, Sellers will submit a final
written proposal to the Companies, who will have five business days to accept
such proposal. If Sellers and the Companies are unable to agree on terms for
the Companies to acquire the Target Assets within the time frame specified in
this Section, Sellers may contract with a third party to acquire the
Target Assets on terms which in the aggregate are no more favorable to the
purchaser than last offered in writing to the Companies. If Sellers contract
with a third party to acquire the Target Assets, the Services Agreement will
terminate with respect to the Target Assets upon 60 days prior written notice
to the Companies, in which event Sellers will be required to pay the unpaid
fees accrued under the Services Agreement with respect to the Target Assets
and reimburse the Companies for any amounts    -12-   payable under the
Buyer\'s generally applicable severance plans with respect to employees that
the Companies decide to terminate as a result of the termination of the
Services Agreement with respect to the Target Assets; provided that
the Companies will cooperate in good faith to permit the purchaser of the
Target Assets to employ any of such employees.   (h) In connection with the
Initial Closing and the Second Closing, the definition of "Service Areas" in
the Directory Services License Agreement will be revised to exclude the
Services Areas in which the Excluded Business that has not been included in a
Second Closing is conducted.   (i) It is the intent of the parties that this
Section 1.8 constitute a binding and enforceable agreement to proceed with
the Initial Closing and the Second Closing in the circumstances described in
Sections 1.8(a) and 1.8(c). The parties agree to use their good faith,
reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on forms of amendments to this
Agreement as contemplated by this Section 1.8 and each of the Ancillary
Agreements and to enter into the Services Agreement, in each case as may be
necessary to effect the Initial Closing and the Second Closing on the terms
described in this Section 1.8. However, if the parties are unable to agree on
any of the terms of such agreements, all issue(s) will be submitted at the
request of either party to binding arbitration in accordance with the
Expedited Procedures of the American Arbitration Association\'s Commercial
Dispute Resolution Procedures, as amended and effective on July 1, 2002. If
arbitration is requested, the Termination Date will be extended if necessary
to a date that is thirty (30) days following the issuance of the
arbitrator\'s ruling.       -13-    ARTICLE II   RELATED
MATTERS    SECTION 2.1 USE OF SPRINT\'S NAME AND LOGOS. Except as
expressly provided in the Trademark License Agreement, it is expressly agreed
that Buyer is not purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining any right,
title or interest in the name "Sprint" or any "Sprint" tradenames,
trademarks, identifying logos or service marks related thereto or employing
any part or variation of any of the foregoing or any confusingly similar
tradename, trademark or logo (collectively, the "SELLER TRADENAMES AND
LOGOS"). Buyer agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates (as
hereinafter defined) shall make any use of the Seller Tradenames and Logos
from and after the Closing Date except as provided in the Directory Services
License Agreement and the Trademark License Agreement. Simultaneously with
the Closing, Buyer will cause the corporate name of SPA to be amended to
remove any reference to the name "Sprint" or any other name that suggests SPA
is a subsidiary of or affiliated with Sprint.   SECTION 2.2 NO ONGOING OR
TRANSITION SERVICES. Except as provided in the Transition Services Agreement
and the Directory Services License Agreement at the Closing, all data
processing, accounting, insurance, banking, personnel, legal, communications
and other services provided to the Companies by Sellers or any Affiliate of
Sellers, including any agreements or understandings (written or oral) with
respect thereto, will terminate.   SECTION 2.3 CERTAIN PRE-CLOSING
MATTERS.   (a) The parties agree that Sellers shall have the right, at
or prior to the Closing, to cause the Companies to distribute all of the cash
held by the Companies to Sellers or their Affiliates on a basis consistent
with Sprint\'s current practice of sweeping all cash on a daily      
-14-   basis. Except as provided in Section 1.4 of this Agreement, no
adjustment shall be made to the Purchase Price as a result of any such
distributions.   (b) Prior to or effective with the Closing, each Company
shall assign to Sprint or its Affiliates, and Sprint or its Affiliates shall
assume (i) all liabilities of each Company which have accrued on or before,
or which are attributable to a Company\'s acts or omissions on or before, the
Closing under each Seller Benefit Plan described in Section 3.14(a) and each
other plan, contract, agreement, program, fund or arrangement which would be
a Seller Benefit Plan described in Section 3.14(a) but for the fact that no
Company has any material liability for the payment of benefits under, or
makes material contributions to, such other plan, contract, agreement,
program, fund or arrangement, and (ii) retention commitments set forth on
SCHEDULE 3.13(d) that are (and shall remain after Closing) the sole
responsibility of Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the
Companies).   (c) Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement,
if, at any time following the Closing, Sellers or their Affiliates receive
any cash or other assets belonging to any Company or Buyer, Sellers will, and
will cause their Affiliates to, as promptly as practicable, deliver such cash
or assets to such Company or Buyer, as applicable.        -15-   
ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS    Sellers hereby
jointly and severally represent and warrant to Buyer, as of the date of this
Agreement and as of the Closing Date, as follows:   SECTION 3.1
ORGANIZATION.   (a) Each of DAI, CDC and SPA is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
States of Kansas, Delaware and Kansas, respectively. Cendon is a limited
liability company duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware. Each Company has all requisite power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business and operations as now being conducted. Each Company is duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the property or assets owned, leased or operated by
such Company or the nature of the business conducted by such Company makes
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect
(as hereinafter defined). SCHEDULE 3.1 sets forth a list of all jurisdictions
where each of the Companies is qualified to do business. Sellers have
heretofore made available to Buyer complete and correct copies of the
certificate of incorporation or articles of incorporation, as the case
may be, and by-laws of the Wholly Owned Companies, as currently in effect,
and the certificate of formation and limited liability company agreement of
Cendon, as currently in effect.   (b) As used in this Agreement, a "COMPANY
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECt" shall mean any event, occurrence, development, state
of circumstances or facts, change or effect       -16-   that has
had, or would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition, operating
results, business, assets or liabilities of the Companies on a consolidated
basis; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that a Company Material Adverse Effect shall not
include any event, occurrence, development, state of circumstances or facts,
change in or effect upon the financial condition, operating
results, business, assets or liabilities of the Companies directly or
indirectly arising out of, attributable to or as a consequence of conditions,
events or circumstances generally affecting the telephone directory
publishing industry, the securities markets or the overall economy (either
generally in the U.S. or in one or more of the jurisdictions in which the
Companies conduct business).   SECTION 3.2 AUTHORIZATION. Sprint is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Kansas. Centel LLC is a limited liability company
duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware. Each Seller and each of its Affiliates has the power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
to which it is a party and perform its respective obligations under this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the
performance by Sellers and its Affiliates of their respective covenants and
agreements under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements have been
duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of Sprint and the
manager of Centel LLC, and no other proceeding on the part of Sellers, the
Wholly Owned Companies, or their shareholders, members or Affiliates is
necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.
This Agreement has been, and at the Closing the Ancillary
Agreements        -17-   shall be, duly executed and delivered by
Sellers and its Affiliates, and this Agreement constitutes, and upon
execution and delivery of the Ancillary Agreements, the Ancillary Agreements
will constitute, a valid and binding agreement of Sellers and its Affiliates,
enforceable against Sellers and its Affiliates, in accordance with their
respective terms, except that (a) such enforcement may be subject to any
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or
other laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to or limiting creditors\'
rights generally and (b) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive
and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and
to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be
brought.   SECTION 3.3 CAPITAL STOCK. SCHEDULE 3.3 sets forth (a) the
authorized, issued and outstanding capital stock of each of the Wholly Owned
Companies, (b) the outstanding membership interests of Cendon and (c) the
owners of the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of the
Companies. The Shares and the outstanding capital stock of SPA have been
validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are free of preemptive
rights of any kind. The membership interests in Cendon have been validly
issued and are free of preemptive rights of any kind. There are no shares of
capital stock of any Wholly Owned Company held as treasury shares. There are
not any outstanding securities convertible into, exchangeable for, or
carrying the right to acquire, equity securities of any Company, nor are
there any subscriptions, warrants, options, rights or other arrangements or
commitments which could obligate any Company to issue any shares of its
capital stock or membership or other equity interests. Except for (i) the
membership interest in Cendon owned by CDC and (ii) the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of SPA owned by DAI, none of the
Companies owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership
interest or any other equity or debt       -18-   securities of any
corporation, firm, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
association or other entity. DAI owns no tangible or intangible assets
(including properties or rights) other than the capital stock of SPA.  
SECTION 3.4 OWNERSHIP OF THE CAPITAL STOCK. Sellers and their respective
wholly owned subsidiaries shown on SCHEDULE 3.4 as the owners of
the outstanding capital stock or membership interests in the Companies have
good title to such stock or membership interests, free and clear of all Liens
(as hereinafter defined).   SECTION 3.5 CONSENTS AND APPROVALS; NO
VIOLATIONS. The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
execution and delivery of the Ancillary Agreements will not, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements will not (a) conflict with or result in any breach of
any provision of the governing instruments of Sellers or any of the
Companies, (b) except as set forth in SCHEDULE 3.5 and for applicable
requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as
amended (the "HSR ACT"), require any filing with, or the obtaining of any
permit, authorization, consent or approval of, or license, qualification or
order of, any governmental or regulatory authority, (c) except as set forth
in SCHEDULE 3.5, violate, conflict with or result in a default (or any event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default)
under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, mortgage,
other evidence of indebtedness, guarantee, license, agreement, lease or other
contract, instrument or obligation to which any Company or Sellers are a
party or by which any Company or Sellers or any of their respective assets
may be bound or under which any Company receives any benefit, whether or not
such Company is a party thereto, including, but not limited to, the Contracts
(as hereinafter defined), or (d) violate        -19-   any order,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to any Company or
Sellers, excluding from the foregoing clauses (b), (c) and (d)
such requirements, violations, conflicts, defaults or rights (i) which would
not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect and would not adversely affect the ability of
Sellers to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
(ii) which become applicable as a result of the business or activities in
which Buyer is or proposes to be engaged or as a result of any acts or
omissions by, or the status of or any facts pertaining to, Buyer.   SECTION
3.6 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES.   (a) Sellers have

consolidated balance sheets of the Companies as of December 31, 1999,

Companies and present fairly and accurately, in all material respects, the

a combined consolidated basis as of the dates and for the applicable periods
indicated, in each case in conformity with GAAP consistently applied except
as noted therein.        -20-    (b) The Companies do not have any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent, unasserted or otherwise) required by GAAP to be reflected on the
Financial Statements that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect, except (i) as
disclosed, reflected or reserved against in the Financial Statements and the
notes thereto, (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the Ordinary
Course of Business (as hereinafter defined) since December 31, 2001, and
(iii) as set forth on SCHEDULE 3.6(b). This representation shall not be

RELATED MATTERS.   (a) Real Property.   (i) SCHEDULE 3.8(a)(i) sets forth
a list of the parcels of real property owned by any Company (together with
the fixtures and improvements thereon, the "OWNED REAL PROPERTY"). SCHEDULE

variances, covenants, rights of way, encumbrances, easements and other minor
irregularities in title, none of such items in (A)-(D) which, individually or

respect with the current use or occupancy of such Owned Real Property
(collectively, "PERMITTED LIENS").   (iii) Each Company has a valid
leasehold interest in the Leased Real Property, free and clear of any Liens
except for Permitted Liens.   (iv) Except as set forth in SCHEDULE

structure of any other Person substantially encroaches upon the Owned Real
Property.   (v) Such Owned Real Property, and its continued use, occupancy
and operation as currently used, occupied and operated, does not constitute a
nonconforming use in any material respect under applicable building, zoning,
subdivision and other land use and similar laws, regulations and ordinances.
Valid certificates of occupancy permitting such uses are in effect with
respect to the Owned Real Property.      -24-    (vi) Except as set

exchange, leasing, transfer, financing or refinancing of any of the

there are no matters that an accurate and complete survey of the Owned Real
Property would disclose that would materially and adversely affect the
ability of Buyer or the Companies to use the Owned Real Property as is
currently being used or that would materially and adversely affect the value
of the Owned Real Property.   (ix) No party other than a Company is in
possession, or has any possession of, all or any material portion of any of
the Real Property.   (b) TITLE TO ASSETS. Except as set forth in SCHEDULE
3.8(b), each Company has good and marketable title to its material assets,

the operation of the Companies\' businesses as currently conducted; and (iv)
"COMPANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY" means the Company Owned Intellectual Property

Sellers, the conduct of the business of the Companies does not infringe upon
any Intellectual Property of any third party. Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE
3.9(b)(i), there are no pending, or to the Knowledge of Sellers threatened,
proceedings, administrative claims or litigation or other adverse claims by
any Person (as hereinafter defined) against the use by the Companies of any
material Company Owned Intellectual Property. To the Knowledge of Sellers,
there are no pending or threatened, proceedings, administrative claims or
litigation or other adverse claims by any Person against the use by the
Companies of any material Company Licensed Intellectual Property. SCHEDULE
3.9(b)(ii) sets forth a list of all material Company Owned Intellectual
Property other than trade secrets, and SCHEDULE 3.9(b)(iii) sets forth a list
of all material Company Licensed Intellectual Property, including a
description of the license agreement with respect thereto. There is no
material Intellectual Property necessary for, or used by the Companies in,
the operation of the Companies\' businesses as currently conducted that is
not Company Intellectual Property.      -26-    (c) Each Company owns
or has all valid licenses and other rights to use the Company Intellectual
Property, except where the failure to have such ownership, licenses or rights
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 3.9(c), to
the Knowledge of the Sellers, there is no material unauthorized use,
disclosure, infringement or misappropriation of any material Company
Intellectual Property by any third party, including any employee or former
employee of the Company.   (d) None of Sellers or any of their Affiliates,
including the Companies, is in default in any material respect regarding any
of its obligations in respect of protecting or maintaining any material

combined consolidated balance sheets of the Companies as of such quarter-end

provide all information reasonably requested by Buyer for inclusion in, any
offering document, Form 8-K or other Exchange Act filing to be incorporated
by reference into a registration statement in connection therewith prepared
in connection with the financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters.
Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for all reasonable third party costs and
expenses incurred by Sellers in connection with the fulfillment of its
obligations under this Section 5.2. Any financial statements provided to
Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.2 will be deemed to be included in the
definition of "Financial Statements" for all purposes of Section 3.6.   (f)
Notwithstanding the above, nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or the
Confidentiality Agreement will preclude any party from making any disclosures
it determines in good faith to be required by law, regulation or listing
agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or
national trading system or necessary and proper in conjunction with the
filing of any tax return or other document required to be filed with any
federal, state or local governmental body, authority or agency or sent to
potential investors in connection with the financings contemplated by the
Financing Commitments; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the party required to make the
release or statement shall, if practicable under the       
-46-   circumstances, allow the other party reasonable time to comment on
such release or statement in advance of such issuance.   (g) Between the
date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Sellers shall permit Buyer\'s
senior officers to meet with the Assistant Controller of Sprint and officers
of the Companies responsible for the Financial Statements, the internal
controls of the Companies and the disclosure controls and procedures of the
Companies to discuss such matters as Buyer may deem reasonably necessary or
appropriate for Buyer to satisfy its obligations under Sections 302 and 906
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any rules and regulations relating
thereto.   SECTION 5.3 CONSENTS.   (a) Each of Sellers and Buyer shall
cooperate, and use its reasonable best efforts, to (i) make all filings

required to pay or agree to pay any compensation to the third parties to New

such third parties\' agreement to enter into a New Contract or provide such
consent or approval. "GROUP CONTRACTS" means the contracts listed on SCHEDULE
5.3(a). In addition to the foregoing, Buyer        -47-   agrees to
provide such security and assurances as to financial capability, resources
and creditworthiness as may be reasonably requested by any governmental

sought in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) With
respect to any Contracts for which any required consent or approval is not
obtained, or New Contract that is not entered into, prior to the Closing
(collectively, "THIRD PARTY APPROVAL CONTRACTS"), Sellers and Buyer shall
each use their reasonable best efforts to obtain any such consent or approval
or New Contract after the Closing Date until such consent or approval or New
Contract has been obtained; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that neither Seller nor Buyer
shall be required to pay or agree to pay any compensation to the
third parties to New Contracts or other contracts requiring consent or
approval in exchange for such third parties\' agreement to enter into a New
Contract or provide such consent or approval.   (c) To the extent that the
consents or approvals or New Contracts referred to in clause (a) above are
not obtained prior to the Closing, Sellers will use commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) provide to the Companies, at its request, the benefits of any
such Third Party Approval Contracts, (ii) cooperate in any reasonable and
lawful arrangement designed to provide the benefits of such Third Party
Approval Contracts to the Companies, and (iii) enforce, at the request and
for the account of the Companies, any rights of the Seller Affiliates that
are parties to such Third Party Approvals Contract against the other party or
parties thereto arising under such Third Party Approvals Contract. Buyer will
comply with all reasonable requests of the Sellers for cooperation in
connection with the performance of Sellers\' obligations under this Section
5.3(c).       -48-    (d) Without limiting any other provision
hereof, each of the Sellers and Buyer shall, as promptly as practicable, but
in no event later than twenty business days following the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, file with the United States Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC") and the United States Department of Justice (the
"DOJ") the notification and report form, if any, required for the

connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act. Any such notification and
report form and supplemental information shall be in substantial compliance
with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each of Sellers and Buyer shall furnish
to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the
other may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or
submission that is necessary under the HSR Act. Sellers and Buyer shall keep
each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and
any inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC and the
DOJ and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or request.   SECTION
5.4 REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS.   (a) Each of Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate
and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable laws and regulations or otherwise to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) Buyer will promptly
notify Sellers of any proposal by any of the institutions party to a
Financing Commitment to withdraw, terminate or make a material change in the
amount or terms of such Financing Commitment that could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the ability of Buyer to consummate the financing
contemplated by such Financing Commitment in accordance with its terms. In
addition, upon Sellers\' reasonable       -49-   request, Buyer shall
advise and update Sellers, in a level of detail reasonably satisfactory to
Sellers, with respect to the status, proposed closing date, and material
terms of the Financing Commitments. Buyer shall not consent to any amendment,
modification or early termination of any Financing Commitment that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the ability of Buyer to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (c) Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain
the effectiveness of the Financing Commitments in accordance with their
terms, (ii) enter into definitive documentation with respect to the Debt

Commitments, (iii) satisfy all funding conditions to the
Financing Commitments set forth in the definitive documentation with respect
to the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments, (iv) consummate
the financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments (including by
extension of the Financing Commitments on substantially equivalent or better
terms or, if the Financing Commitments expire, obtaining alternative
financing in an aggregate principal amount equal to the amounts set forth in,
and on terms substantially equivalent to or better than the terms of, the
Financing Commitments), including by drawing on the "Senior Subordinated
Facility" and the "Senior Secured Credit Facility" (as such terms are defined
in the Debt Financing Commitment Letters) prior to the expiration of the Debt
Financing Commitments if the other conditions to Buyer\'s obligations to
close set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.3 have been satisfied or waived and (v)
perform its obligations under the Financing Commitments.   (d) Sellers will
promptly notify Buyer of any proposal, whether formal or informal, by any
state or federal governmental agency with jurisdiction over local
telecommunications services or local telecommunications companies to assert
jurisdiction over       -50-   all or any part of the transactions
that are the subject matter of this Agreement, including but not limited to,
(i) any proposal to require approval, consent or permission of such
governmental agency to any part of the transactions which are the subject
matter of this Agreement, (ii) any proposal that, individually or in the
aggregate, may have a material adverse effect on the business of Sprint\'s
Local Telecommunications Division, and (iii) any proposal that, individually
or in the aggregate, may have a material adverse effect on the proceeds
Sprint expects to receive from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (each, a "REGULATORY PROPOSAL").   In addition, Sellers shall
advise and update Buyer, in a level of detail reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer, with respect to the status of any such Regulatory Proposal, including
any formal or informal proceedings before such governmental agency with
respect to the Regulatory Proposal. Sellers will promptly notify Buyer if
Sellers consent to (i) the jurisdiction of any such governmental agency with
respect to the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement or (ii)
any order, decree, judgment or finding of such governmental agency with
respect to the transactions that are the subject matter of this
Agreement.   (e) Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to,
use reasonable best efforts to defeat any assertion of jurisdiction and
any Regulatory Proposal and to obtain any necessary approvals, consents
or permissions in response to any Regulatory Proposal, including but not
limited to the timely initiation and prosecution of proceedings for
injunctive relief, mandamus or other appropriate remedies in a court of
competent jurisdiction, the initiation and prosecution of any available
proceedings for appellate review of any order, decree, judgment or finding of
such governmental agency or, if applicable, the prompt filing of any
necessary applications with respect to such Regulatory Proposals. Sellers
will forward to Buyer all copies of any material correspondence sent by it or
its representatives or received by it from any      
-51-   governmental authority regarding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or a Regulatory Proposal.   (f) Each of Sellers and Buyer
shall negotiate in good faith to identify the MIS Services (as defined in the
Transition Services Agreement) to be provided to Buyer under the Transition
Services Agreement and the pricing therefor under the Transition Services
Agreement.   SECTION 5.5 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Except as otherwise agreed to
by the parties, the parties shall not issue any report, statement or press
release or otherwise make any public statements with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as in
the reasonable judgment of the party may be required by law or any listing
agreement with, or the rules of, any national securities exchange or national
trading system. Upon the execution of this Agreement and the Closing, Sellers
and Buyer will consult with each other with respect to the issuance of a
joint report, statement or press release with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 5.6 COVENANT TO
SATISFY CONDITIONS. Sellers will use their reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the conditions set forth in Article VI of this Agreement are satisfied,
to the extent such matters are within the control of Sellers, and Buyer will
use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the conditions set forth in
Article VI of this Agreement are satisfied to the extent such matters are
within the control of Buyer. Sellers and Buyer further covenant and agree,
with respect to a threatened or pending preliminary or permanent injunction
or other order, decree or ruling or statute, rule, regulation or executive
order that would adversely affect the ability of the parties to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to use      
-52-   their reasonable best efforts to prevent or lift the entry,
enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may be.   SECTION 5.7
CERTAIN TAX MATTERS.   (a) CERTAIN DEFINITIONS. As used in this
Agreement:   (i) "PRE-CLOSING PERIOD" means any taxable period,
including that portion of any Straddle Period, which ends on or before the
Closing Date;   (ii) "SECTION 338(h)(10) ELECTION" means the election to
be made by Buyer and Sprint pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code,
as described in Section 5.7(b) of this Agreement;   (iii) "SECTION 754
ELECTION" means the election to be made by Cendon pursuant to Section 754 of
the Code, as described in Section 5.7(b)(ii) of this Agreement; and   (iv)
"STRADDLE PERIOD" means any taxable period that includes (but does not end
on) the Closing Date.    (b) SECTION 338(h)(10) AND SECTION 754
ELECTIONS.   (i) Sprint will join with Buyer in making the
Section 338(h)(10) Election to treat the transaction hereunder as the deemed
sale of the assets of the Wholly Owned Companies for federal and, to the
extent applicable, state and local income tax purposes. Buyer will determine
an allocation of the "ADSP" (as defined in Treasury Regulation secs. 1.338-4
and 1.338(h)(10)-1) among the assets of the Companies pursuant to the
applicable Treasury Regulations under Section 338 of the Code; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Allocation will include an allocation of ADSP to any
amounts receivable by any of the       -53-   Companies without
regard to whether such receivables have been recognized or realized by the
Sellers or any of the Companies for income tax or financial accounting
purposes prior to Closing (as determined finally in accordance with this
Section 5.7(b)(i), the "ALLOCATION"). Promptly following
Buyer\'s determination of the Allocation, Buyer will deliver a proposed
Allocation to Sprint. If Sprint objects to Buyer\'s Allocation, Sprint will
deliver a notice of objection to Buyer no later than the later to occur of
(A) thirty (30) days from the delivery of the proposed Allocation to Sprint
and (B) one hundred and twenty (120) days before the due date of filing any
Tax Returns for which the Allocation is relevant. If no such notice of
objection is delivered, the Buyer\'s proposed Allocation shall be final, and
if such notice of objection is delivered as set forth above, Buyer and
Sellers will use their reasonable best efforts to agree upon the Allocation.
If the parties are unable to agree upon the Allocation within ninety (90)
days before the due date of filing any Tax Return for which the Allocation is
relevant, the Allocation shall be made by the Unrelated Accounting Firm.
Following final determination of the Allocation, Buyer and Sellers will use
the Allocation in reporting the deemed purchase and sale of the assets of the
Companies for federal and, to the extent applicable, state and local income
tax purposes.   (ii) The Sellers agree that the Sellers will cause Cendon
to make the Section 754 Election for the taxable year including the Closing
Date to adjust the basis of all properties and assets of Cendon to account
for the transfer of CDC\'s membership interest in Cendon to Buyer for federal
and, to the extent applicable, state and local income tax purposes. Sprint
and Buyer agree that Buyer\'s basis in CenDon will be made based on and
consistent with the Allocation made pursuant to Section 5.7(b)(i) of this
Agreement.      -54-    (c) RETURN FILING, REFUNDS, CREDITS AND
TRANSFER TAXES.    (i) Except with regard to Tax Returns for Straddle
Periods, Sellers shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause
to be filed, on a timely basis all Tax Returns of or including the Companies
for all Pre-Closing Periods (the "PRE-CLOSING PERIOD RETURNS"). Sellers shall
pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes with respect to the Companies shown to be
due on the Pre-Closing Period Returns.   (ii) Buyer shall prepare, or cause
to be prepared, and shall file, or cause to be filed, on a timely basis all
Tax Returns other than the Pre-Closing Period Returns with respect to the
Companies, including Tax Returns, if any, for the Straddle Period (the
"STRADDLE PERIOD RETURNS"). Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes
shown to be due on such Tax Returns.   (iii) Buyer shall provide Sellers
with copies of any Straddle Period Returns at least sixty (60) business days
prior to the due date thereof (giving effect to any extensions thereto),
accompanied by a statement calculating in reasonable detail Sellers\'
indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 5.7(e) of this Agreement (the
"INDEMNIFICATION STATEMENT"). Sellers shall have the right to review such
Straddle Period Returns and Indemnification Statement prior to the filing of
such Straddle Period Returns. If Sellers dispute any amounts shown to be due
on such Tax Returns or the amount calculated in the Indemnification
Statement, Sellers and Buyer shall consult and resolve in good faith any
issues arising as a result of the review of such Straddle Period Return and
Indemnification Statement. If Sellers agree to the Indemnification Statement
amount, Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Taxes shown on the
Indemnification Statement less any amounts paid by Sellers or the Companies
on or before the Closing Date with respect to estimated taxes not later than
three       -55-   business days before the due date (including any
extensions thereof) for payment of Taxes with respect to such Straddle Period
Return. If the parties are unable to resolve any dispute within thirty (30)
business days after Sellers\' receipt of such Straddle Period Return and
Indemnification Statement, such dispute shall be resolved by the Unrelated
Accounting Firm, which shall resolve any issue in dispute as promptly as
practicable. If the Unrelated Accounting Firm is unable to make a
determination with respect to any disputed issue prior to the due
date (including any extensions) for the filing of the Straddle Period Return
in question, (A) Buyer shall file, or shall cause to be filed, such Straddle
Period Return without such determination having been made and (B) Sellers
shall pay to Buyer, not later than three days before the due date (including
any extensions thereof) for the payment of Taxes with respect to such
Straddle Period Return, an amount determined by Sellers as the proper amount
chargeable to Sellers pursuant to this Section 5.7. Upon delivery to Sellers
and Buyer by the Unrelated Accounting Firm of its determination, appropriate
adjustments shall be made to the amount paid by Sellers in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence in order to reflect the decision of the
Unrelated Accounting Firm. The determination by the Unrelated Accounting Firm
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties.   (iv) Sellers and
Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and representatives
reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns (including
amended returns and claims for refund), including maintaining and making
available to each other all necessary records in connection with determining
Taxes and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable
periods relating to Taxes. Buyer recognizes that Sellers will need access,
from time to time, after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and
tax records and information       -56-   held by the Companies to
the extent such records and information pertain to events occurring prior to
the Closing Date; therefore, Buyer agrees that from and after the Closing
Date Buyer shall, and shall cause the Companies to, (A) retain and maintain
such records until such time as Sellers determine that such retention and
maintenance is no longer necessary and (B) allow Sellers and their agents and
representatives (and agents and representatives of their
Affiliates) reasonable access to inspect, review and make copies of such
records as Sellers may deem necessary or appropriate from time to time. Buyer
shall indemnify Sellers from and against any penalties, additions to tax or
interest imposed on Sellers as a direct result of any failure of Buyer to
provide tax records or other information to Sellers in a reasonable timely
manner.   (v) Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Companies not to,
dispose of or destroy any of the business records and files of the Companies
relating to Taxes in existence on the Closing Date without first offering to
turn over possession thereof to Sellers by written notice to Sellers at least
30 days prior to the proposed date of such disposition or destruction.  
(vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
any refunds and credits of Taxes of the Companies (including any interest or
similar benefit) received from or credited thereon by the applicable tax
authority with respect to (A) any taxable period ending on or before
the Closing Date or (B) Taxes for which Sellers have indemnified the Buyer
under the Agreement, shall be for the account of Sellers, and if received or
utilized by Buyer or the Companies, shall be paid to Sellers within five
business days after Buyer or a Company receives such refund or utilizes such
credit. Except as provided in the next sentence, any refunds or credits of
the Companies with respect to any Straddle Period shall be apportioned
between Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, on the basis
of an       -57-   interim closing of the books. In the case of a
refund or credit attributable to any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic
basis and are attributable to the Straddle Period, other than Taxes based
upon or related to gross or net income or receipts, the refund or credit of
such Taxes of the Company for the Pre-Closing Period shall be deemed to be
the amount of such refund or credit for the Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the Straddle Period.   (vii) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, all sales, use, transfer, stamp, duties, recording
and similar Taxes, but not including any Taxes on or measured by income,
gains or profits, incurred in connection with and solely as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by Buyer, and Buyer
shall, at its own expense, accurately file or cause to be filed all necessary
Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to such Taxes and timely pay
all such Taxes; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event the amount of such Taxes
exceeds $5,000 (the "TRANSFER TAX LIMIT"), Buyer and Sellers shall each be
responsible for paying one-half of the amount by which such Taxes exceed the
Transfer Tax Limit. If required by applicable law, Sellers will join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns or such other documentation.    (d)
ELECTIONS. Except with respect to the Section 338(h)(10) Election and the
Section 754 Election, Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Companies not to,
make, amend, or revoke any Tax election if such action would adversely affect
Sellers, or any Person (other than the Companies) as to whom or with whom
Sellers have filed a consolidated return, with respect to any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date or for the Pre-Closing       
-58-   Period or any Tax refund with respect thereto and Seller shall not
make any Tax election if such action would adversely affect Buyer or any
Company.   (e) TAX INDEMNIFICATION.   (i) Buyer shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless Sellers and their Affiliates, at any time after the
Closing, from and against any liability for Taxes of the Companies for any
taxable period ending after the Closing Date except for Straddle Periods, in
which case Buyer\'s indemnity will cover only that portion of any such Taxes
that is not attributable to the Pre-Closing Period and, except to the extent
any such Taxes arose out of or related to any breach of any representation
made by Sellers pursuant to Section 3.16 of the Agreement.   (ii) Sellers
shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer and its
Affiliates, at any time after the Closing, (A) from and against any liability
for Taxes of the Companies, except as provided in Section 5.7(c)(vii) of the
Agreement, for the Pre-Closing Period (including Taxes attributable to the
portion of any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date); and (B) any
liability for income Taxes of any member of an affiliated group with which
any Company files or has filed a consolidated or combined Tax Return with
respect to any taxable period which ends before or includes the Closing Date
by reason of any Company being severally liable for such Tax pursuant to
Treasury Regulation sec. 1.1502-6 or any analogous provision of foreign,
state or local law.   (iii) In determining the responsibility of Sellers and
Buyer for Taxes attributable to any Straddle Period, Taxes based upon or
related to gross or net income or receipts shall be apportioned on the basis
of an interim closing of the books as of the Closing Date (and for such
purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through
entity       -59-   which is a Company or in which a Company holds an
interest, shall be deemed to terminate at such time), and all other Taxes
attributable to any Straddle Period shall be prorated on a daily basis.  
(iv) If a claim for Taxes shall be made by any taxing authority in writing,
which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment pursuant to this
Section 5.7, the party seeking indemnification (the "TAX INDEMNIFIED PARTY")
shall promptly notify the other party (the "TAX INDEMNIFYING PARTY") in
writing of such claim (a "TAX CLAIM") within a reasonably sufficient period
of time to allow the Tax Indemnifying Party effectively to contest such Tax
Claim, and in reasonable detail to apprise the Tax Indemnifying Party of
the nature of the Tax Claim, and provide copies of all correspondence and
documents received by it from the relevant taxing authority. Failure to give
prompt notice of a Tax Claim hereunder shall affect the Tax Indemnifying
Party\'s obligation under this Section to the extent that the Tax
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure to give prompt notice.  
(v) With respect to any Tax Claim which might result in an indemnity payment
to Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.7(e) (including, without limitation,
Taxes of a Company for a Straddle Period), Sellers shall, upon confirming in
writing their obligation to indemnify Buyer in respect of such Tax Claim,
control all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim and, without
limiting the foregoing, may in their sole discretion and at their
sole expense pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals,
proceedings, hearings and conferences with any taxing authority with respect
thereto, and may, in their sole discretion, either pay the Tax claimed and
sue for a refund where applicable law permits such refund suits or contest
such Tax Claim. Buyer, without waiving its right to be indemnified in respect
of such Tax Claim, shall not under any circumstances settle or otherwise
compromise any Tax Claim        -60-   referred to in the preceding
sentence without Sellers\' prior written consent; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
Sellers have confirmed in writing their obligation to indemnify Buyer in
respect of such Tax Claim and are in material compliance with Sellers\'
indemnification obligation hereunder. In connection with any proceeding taken
in connection with such Tax Claim, (A) Sellers shall keep Buyer informed of
all material developments and events relating to such Tax Claim and (B)
Buyer shall have the right, at its sole expense, to participate in any
such proceedings. Buyer shall cooperate with Sellers in contesting such Tax
Claim (without charge to Sellers), which cooperation shall include,
without limitation, the retention and the provision to Sellers of records
and information which are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and
making employees available to Sellers to provide additional information or
explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings
relating to such Tax Claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no charges shall be
incurred by Sellers for the services of such employees.   (vi) With respect
to any Tax Claim not described in Section 5.7(e)(v) of this Agreement which
might result in an indemnity payment to Sellers pursuant hereto, Buyer shall
control all proceedings in accordance with provisions that are parallel to
those in Section 5.7(e)(v) of this Agreement.   (vii) All matters relating
in any manner to Tax indemnification obligations and payment of Taxes shall
be governed exclusively by this Section   SECTION 5.8 NO SOLICITATION. If
this Agreement is terminated for any reason pursuant to Article VII, for a
period of two years following the effective date of such termination, neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, solicit or
induce any employee, agent or contractor of any Company to leave such
employment and become an employee, agent or contractor of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates if Buyer was apprised of or had        -61-   contact
with such employee, agent or contractor in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing in this
Section 5.8 shall prohibit Buyer or any of its Affiliates from employing any
person who contacts them on his or her own initiative and without any
direct or indirect solicitation by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, as the
case may be. This Section 5.8 shall not be interpreted to prohibit
solicitations of employment through general advertising not specifically
directed at the employees, agents or contractors of the Companies. If this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article VII, this Section 5.8 supersedes
the employee nonsolicitation provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreements.   SECTION 5.9 TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT. At the Closing,
Sprint and/or certain of its Affiliates and the Companies shall enter into a
Transition Services Agreement substantially in the form attached as EXHIBIT
5.9 (the "TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT").   SECTION 5.10 DIRECTORY
SERVICES LICENSE AGREEMENT. At the Closing, the Companies and certain
Affiliates of Sprint shall enter into a Directory Services License Agreement,
substantially in the form attached as EXHIBIT 5.10 (the "DIRECTORY SERVICES
LICENSE AGREEMENT").   SECTION 5.11 GUARANTEES. Prior to the Closing,
Sellers shall (a) cause the Companies to be released as guarantor of any
financing of Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Companies), (b)
cause the Companies to no longer be parties to the agreements listed on
SCHEDULE 3.7 and (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Companies to be released from all past, present and future obligations under
the agreements listed on SCHEDULE 3.7.   SECTION 5.12 INVESTIGATION BY
BUYER. Buyer has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the
business, operations, technology, assets, liabilities, results      
-62-   of operations, financial condition and prospects of the Companies
and acknowledges that Sellers have provided Buyer with the access requested
by Buyer to the personnel, properties, premises and records of the Companies
for this purpose. In entering into this Agreement, Buyer has relied upon its
own investigation and analysis as well as the representations and warranties
of Sellers contained in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and
Buyer (a) acknowledges that none of Sellers, the Companies or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling
Persons, agents or representatives makes or has made any representation or
warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of
any of the information provided or made available to Buyer or its directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents or
representatives, and (b) agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that
neither Sellers, the Companies nor any of their respective directors,
officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents or
representatives shall have any liability or responsibility whatsoever to
Buyer or its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons,
agents or representatives on any basis (including, without limitation, in
contract or tort, under federal or state securities laws or otherwise) based
upon any information provided or made available, or statements made, to Buyer
or its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons,
agents or representatives (or any omissions therefrom), except in the case of
clauses (a) and (b) as and only to the extent expressly set forth in this

Sellers and the Companies shall enter into a Mutual Release substantially in
the form attached as EXHIBIT 5.13 (the "MUTUAL RELEASE").     
-63-    SECTION 5.14 EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.   (a)
EMPLOYMENT. Buyer shall cause each Company to continue to employ immediately
after the Closing each of the individuals who were employed by such Company
immediately before the Closing (individually a "COMPANY EMPLOYEE" and
collectively the "COMPANY EMPLOYEES") at (1) substantially the same base
salary or base hourly rate of compensation as in effect for each
such individual immediately before the Closing and with (2)(A) benefits under
a Buyer 401(k) Plan (as defined in Section 5.14(b)) and benefit accruals for
service after the Closing under a Buyer Pension Plan (as defined in Section
5.14(c)) which are the same as the benefits Buyer provides for Buyer\'s
employees who work in the same line of business as the Company Employees and
(B) welfare benefits, including severance benefits (except for severance
benefits during the one year period which begins on the Closing Date which
shall be paid in accordance with Section 5.14(a)(3)), under Buyer\'s welfare
plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) which are the same to the maximum
extent practicable as the welfare plan benefits Buyer provides for Buyer\'s
employees who work in the same line of business as the Company Employees;
provided, however, (3) Buyer shall provide severance benefits to any such
individual whose employment is terminated by Buyer or, if Buyer transfers
such individual to another employer as part of an outsourcing arrangement, is
terminated by such other employer at any time during the one year period
which starts on the Closing which are no less than the severance benefits
provided under the Sprint Corporation Separation Plan which would have been
payable under such plan if such individual\'s employment had been terminated
by a Company under similar circumstances immediately before the Closing and
(4) Buyer shall not have any obligation to employ immediately after the
Closing (A) any individual named on SCHEDULE 5.14 or (B) any individual
who has met all the requirements for short-term or long-term    
-64-   disability benefits under one of the Seller Benefit Plans on or
before the Closing until such individual is able to return to work, at which
point Buyer\'s obligation to employ such individual shall be subject to such
terms and conditions as permissible under applicable law with respect to any
employee who had been on a short-term or long-term disability leave, and any
such individual then employed by Buyer shall be eligible for the same
benefits upon his or her employment as then provided to Company Employees.
Each Company Employee shall receive credit for all service completed with
Sellers, each Company and each ERISA Affiliate (and their predecessors)
immediately prior to the Closing for all purposes under Buyer\'s employee
benefit plans as if such service had been completed with Buyer; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER that Buyer shall have no obligation to provide such service credit
for purposes of computing any such employee\'s accrued benefit under any
defined benefit plan (as defined in Section 414(j) of the Code) or
determining any such employee\'s eligibility to receive post-retirement
welfare benefits.   (b) 401(K) PLANS.   (i) SPRINT 401(K) PLAN. Sprint
shall make contributions on behalf of the Company Employees to the Seller
ERISA Plan which is the Sprint Retirement Savings Plan through the Closing,
but Sprint shall take such action as necessary or appropriate to assure that
no Company Employee shall be eligible to make or receive contributions under
such plan for any period ending after the Closing and that no Company
Employee will be eligible to otherwise actively participate in such plan
after the Closing. Sprint shall take whatever action is necessary or
appropriate with respect to each Company Employee who is employed by Buyer
immediately after the Closing to (1) make his or her account under the Sprint
Retirement Savings Plan nonforfeitable as of the Closing and (2) provide the
same opportunity to each such Company Employee to repay his or her loan
or loans, if any, from such plan as currently       -65-   provided
under the terms of the Sprint Retirement Savings Plan to the only class of
employees who currently have such opportunity under the terms of such
plan upon a termination of employment.    (ii) BUYER 401(k) PLAN. The
Company Employees shall be eligible as of the Closing to participate in a
plan established, maintained or adopted by Buyer which is described in
Section 401(k) of the Code (individually a "BUYER 401(k) PLAN") and which
shall provide for elective deferrals (as such deferrals are described in
Section 402(g)(3)(A) of the Code) by participants under Section 401(k) of the
Code and for matching contributions (as described in Section 401(m)(4)(A)(ii)
of the Code) by Buyer with respect to such elective deferrals, all consistent
with the requirements of Section 5.14(a)(2)(A). The Buyer 401(k) Plan shall
provide that the Company Employees shall have the right to make direct
rollovers to such plan of their vested accounts in the Sprint Retirement
Savings Plan to the extent such rollovers constitute "eligible rollover
distributions" within the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code.
The Company Employees shall receive credit under the Buyer 401(k) Plan for
all service with Sellers, each Company and each ERISA Affiliate (and
their predecessors) for purposes of satisfying any service requirement to
participate in such plan and any service requirement to earn a nonforfeitable
benefit under such plan.   (c) PENSION PLANS.   (i) SPRINT PENSION PLAN.
Sprint shall take such action as necessary or appropriate to assure that no
Company Employees shall be eligible to accrue any benefits for service
completed or compensation paid for periods after the Closing under
the       -66-   Seller Benefit Plan which is the Sprint Retirement
Pension Plan and that no Company Employees will be eligible to otherwise
actively participate in such plan after the Closing.   (ii) BUYER PENSION
PLAN. If any employees of Buyer (as determined in accordance with the rules
under Section 414(b) and Section 414(c) of the Code) participate in any
defined benefit plan (as defined in Section 414(j) of the Code) other than a
multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 414(f) of the Code) (individually a
"BUYER PENSION PLAN"), the Company Employees shall be eligible to participate
in such plan as of the Closing. If there is more than one Buyer Pension Plan,
the Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Buyer Pension
Plan which in Buyer\'s reasonable judgment provides benefits which in the
aggregate are more like the benefits provided under the Sprint Retirement
Pension Plan than the benefits provided under any other Buyer Pension Plan.
The Company Employees shall receive credit under the Buyer Pension Plan in
which such employees participate for all service with Sellers, each Company,
and each ERISA Affiliate (and their predecessors) for purposes of satisfying
any service requirement to participate in such plan and any service
requirement to earn a nonforfeitable benefit under such plan, but Buyer shall
have no obligation to provide such service credit for purposes of computing
any such employee\'s accrued benefit under such plan.   (d) MEDICAL AND
RELATED HEALTHCARE BENEFITS AND LIFE INSURANCE.   (i) SELLER WELFARE PLANS.
Sellers shall continue after the Closing to make available to each Company
Employee coverage under the Seller Benefit Plans which are welfare plans (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), including post-retirement health and
dental benefit coverage, to the same extent, and subject to the same terms
and conditions,       -67-   that such coverage would be continued
under the terms of such plans for any other former employee, and each such
Company Employee who satisfies the age and service requirements for post-
retirement health and dental benefit coverage immediately prior to the
Closing shall have the same opportunity to receive such coverage after the
Closing as if such Company Employee had terminated employment immediately
prior to the Closing.   (ii) BUYER WELFARE PLANS. Buyer on the Closing shall
make available to the Company Employees Buyer\'s welfare plans (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) consistent with the requirements of Section
5.14(a)(2)(B), and each Company Employee shall receive full credit under
Buyer\'s welfare plans for all service completed with Sellers, each Company
and each ERISA Affiliate (and their predecessors) and for all payments made
by such employee under any similar Seller Benefit Plan to satisfy any
deductible or co-pay requirements under such plan; PROVIDED, HOWEVER that
Buyer shall have no obligation to provide such service credit for purposes of
determining any such employee\'s eligibility to receive post-retirement
welfare benefits.   (e) 2002 MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE PLAN. In the event the
Closing occurs prior to Sprint making the payments called for under the
Companies\' 2002 Management Incentive Plan for Company Employees based on
their performance for the year 2002, Sprint shall compute the payments due
such employees and shall instruct Buyer as to the amount of such payments due
such employees. Buyer then shall make the payments due such Company Employees
pursuant to such instructions. Sprint will reimburse Buyer for any payments
made to such Company Employees pursuant to this Section 5.14(e) and for the
tax paid by Buyer on such payments in accordance with Section 3111(b) of the
Code within ten (10) business days of the       -68-   date Buyer
certifies to Sprint that such payments have been made and such taxes have
been paid. Sprint will be responsible for computing the payments due
under this Section 5.14(e), for answering any questions from Company
Employees regarding such payments and for resolving any disputes with any
Company Employee regarding Sprint\'s computations.   (f) NON-QUALIFIED
DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN. The interest of each Company Employee in the
Sprint Executive Deferred Compensation Plan shall remain nonforfeitable and
shall be paid (subject to the terms and conditions of such plan) in
accordance with the deferral elections made under such plan by such Company
Employee.   (g) SELLER BENEFIT PLANS. Buyer shall not have any liabilities
with respect to any Seller Benefit Plans except to the extent (i) Buyer
agrees to make any payments to Company Employees eligible for the Companies\'
2002 Management Incentive Plan pursuant to Section 5.14(e), and (ii) any
contribution required with respect to any Seller Benefit Plans for
periods ending on or before the Closing remains unpaid after the Closing to
the extent reflected on the Current Assets and the Current Liabilities of the
Companies on the Final Balance Sheet.   SECTION 5.15 NO SOLICITATION OF
TRANSACTIONS. Until the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article VII, none of Sellers or their Affiliates will directly or indirectly,
through any officer, director, agent or otherwise, initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information or
assistance) any offer or proposal for, or enter into negotiations of any
type, or any letter of intent or purchase agreement, merger agreement or
other similar agreement with any person, firm or corporation other than Buyer
with respect to, a sale of any assets (other than in the Ordinary Course of
Business and not in violation of Section 5.1) of a Company, or a merger,
consolidation or business combination in        -69-   which a
Company is a constituent entity, any sale of all or any portion of
a Company\'s capital stock or membership interests, or any liquidation or
similar extraordinary transaction with respect to a Company (a "COMPETING
TRANSACTION"). From and after the date hereof, Sellers will immediately cease
all discussions and negotiations with respect to any Competing Transaction,
and will promptly request the return or destruction of all confidential
information previously distributed to all parties interested in a Competing
Transaction (other than Buyer) pursuant to the terms of any confidentiality
agreement or otherwise.   SECTION 5.16 NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT. At the

the Companies all books and records relating to the business of the
Companies, including without limitation, the books of account, tax,
financial, accounting and personnel records, files,

Closing Date with retroactive effect from the date of such sale.   SECTION
5.22 INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS; CENDON PAYMENTS. All intercompany accounts
between Sellers or their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the

failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying
Party from liability under this Agreement with respect to such claim only if,
and only to the extent that, such failure to notify the Indemnifying Party
actually and materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party with respect to
such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice
delivered to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days thereafter, to
assume the defense of such action or proceeding, including the employment of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of
the fees and disbursements of such counsel. In any action or proceeding with
respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder, the Indemnified
Party or the Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of
such action, shall have the right to participate in such litigation and to
retain its own counsel at such party\'s own expense. The Indemnifying Party
or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall at all times
use reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified
Party, as the case may be, reasonably apprised of the status of the defense
of any action the defense of which they are maintaining and to cooperate in
good faith with each other with respect to the defense of any such
action.       -82-    (b) No Indemnified Party may settle or
compromise any claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to
which indemnification is being sought hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party. An Indemnifying Party may not, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any
claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which
indemnification is being sought hereunder unless (i) simultaneously with the
effectiveness of such settlement, compromise or consent, the Indemnifying
Party pays in full any obligation imposed on the Indemnified Party by such
settlement, compromise or consent, which releases the Indemnified Party
completely in connection with such settlement, compromise or consent and (ii)
such settlement, compromise or consent does not contain any equitable order,
judgment or term which in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with
the business of the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Party\'s
Affiliates.   (c) In the event an Indemnified Party shall claim a right
to payment pursuant to this Agreement not involving a third party claim
covered by Section 9.3(a), such Indemnified Party shall send written notice
of such claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall
specify the basis for such claim. As promptly as possible after the
Indemnified Party has given such notice, such Indemnified Party and the
appropriate Indemnifying Party shall establish the merits and amount of such
claim (by mutual agreement, litigation, arbitration or otherwise) and, within
five business days of the final determination of the merits and amount of
such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party
immediately available funds in an amount equal to such claim as determined
hereunder.   SECTION 9.4 CLAIMS PERIOD. For purposes of this Agreement, a
"CLAIMS PERIOD" shall be the period after the Closing Date which a claim
for indemnification may be      -83-   asserted under this Agreement
by an Indemnified Party. The Claims Periods under this Agreement shall
commence on the Closing Date and shall terminate with respect to Buyer Losses
or Seller Losses arising with respect to (a) any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty on the expiration of the applicable survival
period set forth in Section 8.1 and (b) with respect to any breach or
nonperformance of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement, six months
after the date Buyer (with respect to any Buyer Indemnified Party) or Sellers
(with respect to any Seller Indemnified Party), as the case may be, obtains
Knowledge of such breach or nonperformance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
prior to the close of business on the last day of the applicable Claims
Period, an Indemnifying Party shall have been properly notified of a claim
for indemnity hereunder and such claim shall not have been finally resolved
or disposed of at such date, such claim shall continue to survive and shall
remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally resolved
or disposed of in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.   SECTION 9.5
LIABILITY LIMITS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, except for fraud, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not make a
claim against Sellers for indemnification under Section 9.1(a) for Buyer
Losses (a) for any single Buyer Loss less than $250,000 and (b) unless and
until the aggregate amount of Buyer Losses under Section 9.1(a)
exceeds $25,000,000 (the "BUYER DEDUCTIBLE"), and then only to the extent
such Buyer Losses exceed the Buyer Deductible. Further, the sum of Sellers\'
indemnification obligations hereunder and any amounts payable by Sprint for
consequential damages resulting from a breach by Sprint or its Affiliates
under the Trademark License Agreement, shall not exceed in the aggregate
$660,000,000 (the "CAP AMOUNT").      -84-    SECTION 9.6 NETTING OF
LOSSES. The amount of any Seller Losses or Buyer Losses for which
indemnification is provided under this Article IX shall take into account (a)
in the case of Sellers\' indemnification obligations under Section 9.1 of
this Agreement, any specific reserves included in the Final Balance Sheet and
included in the determination of Closing Date Net Working Capital, (b) in the
case of Sellers\' indemnification obligations under Section 9.1 of this
Agreement or Buyer\'s indemnification obligations under Section 9.2 of this
Agreement, (i) any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party pursuant to any
indemnification by, or indemnification agreement with, any third party, and
(ii) any insurance proceeds or other cash receipts or sources
of reimbursement received in connection with any such Seller Losses or Buyer
Losses and (c) any Tax consequences associated with such Losses and the
recovery thereof. If the amount to be netted hereunder from any payment
required under Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 of this Agreement is determined
after payment by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article IX, the
Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after such
determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had to
pay pursuant to this Article IX had such determination been made at the time
of such payment.   SECTION 9.7 EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES. Except for fraud, the
provisions of this Article IX and Sections 5.7 and 10.11 set forth the
exclusive rights and remedies of Buyer and Sellers to seek or obtain damages
or any other remedy or relief whatsoever from any party with respect to
matters arising under or in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than any remedy or relief
arising from the failure of any party to perform its obligations under the
Ancillary Agreements). All payments made between Buyer and Sellers pursuant
to Article VII, this Article IX and Sections 5.7 and 10.11 shall constitute
adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax and other purposes.     
-85-    ARTICLE X   MISCELLANEOUS    SECTION 10.1 FEES AND EXPENSES.
Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, Sellers and Buyer shall pay all fees and expenses incurred by,
or on behalf of, Sellers or Buyer, respectively, in connection with, or in
anticipation of, this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 10.2 FURTHER ASSURANCES. From time
to time after the Closing Date, at the reasonable request of the other party
to this Agreement and at the expense of the party so requesting, each of the
parties to this Agreement shall execute and deliver to such requesting party
such documents and take such other action as such requesting party may
reasonably request in order to consummate more effectively the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 10.3 NOTICES. All notices,

SEVERABILITY. Should any provision of this Agreement for any reason be
declared invalid or unenforceable, such decision shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of any of the other provisions of this
Agreement, which remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect
and the application of such invalid or unenforceable provision to Persons
or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or
unenforceable shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by
law; PROVIDED, that the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any materially adverse manner to any
party.   Should Section 5.8 of this Agreement or any word, phrase,
clause, sentence or other portion thereof for any reason be declared illegal
or unenforceable, such Section or portions thereof shall be modified or
deleted in such a manner so as to make Section 5.8 of this Agreement as
modified legal and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable laws.   SECTION 10.5 BINDING EFFECT; ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement
and all of the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties to        -88-   this Agreement
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned, directly or indirectly, including, without limitation, by operation
of law, by any party to this Agreement without the prior written consent of
the other parties to this Agreement, except that Buyer may, without such
consent assign all such rights and obligations to (a) an Affiliate of Buyer
or (b) on or after the Closing Date, to any lender or other party as
collateral in connection with any financing; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such
assignment shall release Buyer of any of its obligations under
this Agreement.   SECTION 10.6 NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement
is solely for the benefit of Sellers, and their successors and permitted
assigns, with respect to the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, and
for the benefit of Buyer, and its respective successors and permitted
assigns, with respect to the obligations of Sellers, under this Agreement,
and this Agreement shall not be deemed to confer upon or give to any other
third party any remedy, claim, liability, reimbursement, cause of action or
other right.   SECTION 10.7 INTERPRETATION.   (a) As used in this

of this Agreement.   SECTION 10.10 GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of

principles of conflicts of laws thereof) as to all matters, including but not
limited to matters of validity, construction, effect, performance and
remedies.   SECTION 10.11 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties acknowledge and
agree that any breach of the terms of this Agreement would give rise to
irreparable harm for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy and
accordingly the parties agree that, in addition to any other remedies, each
shall be entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement by a       
-90-   decree of specific performance without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without the necessity of posting

which shall constitute one and the same agreement.   SECTION 10.13

failure of Sellers or Buyer to comply with any term or provision of this
Agreement may be waived, with respect to Buyer, by Sellers and, with respect
to Sellers, by Buyer, by an instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of
the appropriate party, but such waiver or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with such term or provision shall not operate as a waiver
of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure to
comply.   SECTION 10.14 KNOWLEDGE. "TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF SELLERS" or any
similar phrase contained in this Agreement shall mean the actual knowledge of
the officers of Sprint and its Affiliates as set forth on SCHEDULE 10.14. "TO

PARTIES,        -91-   WHETHER UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT,
AND WHETHER MADE BY CLAIM, COUNTER-CLAIM, THIRD PARTY CLAIM OR OTHERWISE.  
If for any reason the jury waiver is held to be unenforceable, the parties
agree to binding arbitration for any dispute arising out of this Agreement or
any claim arising under any federal, state or local statutes, laws or
regulations, under the applicable commercial rules of the
American Arbitration Association and 9 U.S.C. sec. 1, ET. SEQ. Any

party to waive its right to a jury trial will be binding on its successors
and assigns and will survive the termination of
this Agreement.                            
-92-        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties to this Agreement have
caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first above written.
