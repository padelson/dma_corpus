Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be

immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in
accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such certificate of
incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time, Article I of the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and

the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.

(ii)Directors and Officers.

(A)Directors. Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective
Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time

and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company, the Company
Stockholders or any other Person, each share of common stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
cancelled and converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of
Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall thereupon evidence
ownership only of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(b)Company Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Company
Stockholders or any other Person:

(i)Each share of Company Series B Preferred Stock (other than Dissenting
Shares) that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right
to receive: (A) an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Series B
Consideration, minus the Per Share Escrow Amount, minus the Per Share Expense
Amount; and (B) the contingent right to receive any amounts that may become
payable in the future from the Escrow Fund and/or the Expense Fund (in each
case, as provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, at the
respective times and subject to the contingencies specified herein and
therein), in each case, upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate (or
Affidavit of Loss) in respect thereof and the Exchange Documents all in the
manner provided in Section 2.3(d);

(ii)Each share of Company Series A-1 Preferred Stock (other than Dissenting
Shares) that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right
to receive: (A) an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Series A-1
Consideration, minus the Per Share Escrow Amount, minus the Per Share Expense
Amount; and (B) the contingent right to receive any amounts that may become
payable in the future from the Escrow Fund and/or the Expense Fund (in each
case, as provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, at the
respective times and subject to the contingencies specified herein and
therein), in each case, upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate (or
Affidavit of Loss) in respect thereof and the Exchange Documents all in the
manner provided in Section 2.3(d);

(iii)Each share of Company Series Seed Preferred Stock (other than Dissenting
Shares) that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right
to receive: (A) an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Common Consideration,
minus the Per Share Escrow Amount, minus the Per Share Expense Amount; and (B)
the contingent right to receive any amounts that may become payable in the
future from the Escrow Fund and/or the Expense Fund (in each case, as provided
in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, at the respective times and
subject to the contingencies specified herein and therein), in each case, upon
surrender of the Company Stock Certificate (or Affidavit of Loss) in respect
thereof and the Exchange Documents all in the manner provided in Section
2.3(d);

 (iv)Each share of Company Common Stock (other than Cancelled Shares and
Dissenting Shares) that is issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the
right to receive: (A) an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Common
Consideration, minus the Per Share Escrow Amount, minus the Per Share Expense
Amount; and (B) the contingent right to receive any amounts that may become
payable in the future from the Escrow Fund and/or the Expense Fund (in each
case, as provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, at the

therein), in each case, upon surrender of the Company Stock Certificate (or
Affidavit of Loss) in respect thereof and the Exchange Documents all in the
manner provided in Section 2.3(d).

(v)Until so surrendered, each Company Stock Certificate that is outstanding
after the Effective Time shall be deemed, for all purposes after the Effective
Time, to evidence only the right to receive the consideration payable pursuant
to the above Sections 1.3(b)(i)-(iv). For purposes of calculating the
aggregate amount of consideration payable to each Company Stockholder pursuant
to Sections 1.3(b)(i)-(iv), (A) all shares of the Company Capital Stock held
by each such Company Stockholder shall be aggregated and (B) the amount of
cash to be paid to each Company Stockholder for each Company share certificate
held by such Company Stockholder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole
cent.

(vi)Each share of Company Capital Stock that is issued and outstanding and
held by the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Cancelled
Shares") shall be cancelled without any consideration paid therefor.

(vii)Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary,
any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and with respect to which the holder thereof has properly
demanded appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law, and
who has not effectively withdrawn or lost such holder's appraisal rights under
Delaware Law (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted
into or represent a right to receive the applicable consideration for Company
Capital Stock set forth in Section 1.3(b), but the holder thereof shall only
be entitled to such rights as are provided by Delaware Law. Notwithstanding
the provisions of this Section 1.3(b)(vii), if any holder of Dissenting Shares
shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
such holder's appraisal rights under Delaware Law, then, as of the later of
the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares
shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive
the consideration for Company Capital Stock, as applicable, set forth in
Section 1.3(b), without interest thereon, and subject to the escrow provisions
set forth in Section 2.3(b)(ii) and Article VIII and expense provisions in
Article IX, upon surrender of the certificate representing such shares. The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demand for
appraisal received by the Company pursuant to the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, make any payment with respect to any such
demands or offer to settle or settle any such demands. Any communication to be
made by the Company to any Company Stockholder with respect to such demands
shall be submitted to Parent in advance and shall not be presented to any
Company Stockholder prior to the Company receiving Parent's prior written
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(c)Company Options.

(i)Vested Company Options. No Vested Company Options shall be assumed or
continued by Parent and the Company in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Each Vested Company Option (that is not a
Cancelled Option, if any) outstanding as of immediately

 prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted automatically
into the right to receive at the Effective Time with respect to each share
subject thereto, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (A) the excess,
if any, of the Per Share Common Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise in full of such Company Option over the per
share exercise price of such Vested Company Option, minus the Per Share Escrow
Amount, minus the Per Share Expense Amount (such excess amount being
hereinafter referred to as the "Vested Company Option Cash Out Amount"); and
(B) the contingent right to receive any amounts that may become payable in the
future from the Escrow Fund and/or the Expense Fund (in each case, as provided
in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, at the respective times and
subject to the contingencies specified herein and therein), all calculated in
accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement. Vested Company Options with a per share exercise price greater than
or equal to the Per Share Common Consideration shall be cancelled without
consideration. The payment of the Vested Company Option Cash Out Amount to any
holder of Vested Company Options shall be paid at such time(s) provided in
this Agreement to the Surviving Corporation for further payment to the holders
of Employee Company Options through the Surviving Corporation's payroll
processing system net of applicable Tax withholding and deductions, and in
respect of Non-Employee Company Options, shall be paid to the Payment Agent
for further payment to the Non-Employee Company Option Holders. For purposes
of calculating the aggregate amount of consideration payable to each holder of
a Vested Company Option pursuant to this Section 1.3(c), (x) all shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise in full of the Vested Company
Options held by each holder of Vested Company Options shall be aggregated and
(y) the amount of cash to be paid to each such holder of Vested Company
Options shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company, or the holders or recipients of Vested Company Options, each
Vested Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that
is a Cancelled Option shall be cancelled and extinguished for no
consideration, and shall cease to exist.

(ii)Unvested Company Options.

(A)No Unvested Company Options shall be assumed or continued by Parent and the
Company in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders or
recipients of Unvested Company Options, each Unvested Company Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled,
extinguished and shall cease to exist and shall be converted into a number of
shares of restricted Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) (each, a "Parent Restricted Stock Award") having an aggregate Parent
Common Stock Value equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Per
Share Common Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock that would
have been issuable upon the exercise in full of such Unvested Company Option
over the per share exercise price of such Unvested Company Option multiplied
by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such determination
shall be made on an award-by-award basis. Unvested Company Options with a per
share exercise price greater than or equal to the Per Share Common
Consideration shall be cancelled without consideration. The aggregate value of
all Parent Restricted Stock Awards to be made hereunder shall be referred to
herein as the "Aggregate Unvested Option Consideration."

(B)Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action
at the Effective Time on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, or the
holders or recipients of Unvested Company

 Options, each Unvested Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is a Cancelled Option shall be cancelled and extinguished
for no consideration, and shall cease to exist.

(C)The Parent Restricted Stock Awards issued pursuant to Section 1.3(c)(i)(C)
and Section 6.17 shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

a)Prior to and as a condition to receiving any Parent Restricted Stock Award,
each holder of an Unvested Company Option shall have first executed and
delivered to Parent a Parent Restricted Stock Award Agreement, in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Parent Restricted
Stock Award Agreement");

b)Shares of restricted Parent Common Stock subject to each Parent Restricted
Stock Award shall vest on the vesting schedule set forth in the applicable
Parent Restricted Stock Award Agreement governing such Parent Restricted Stock
Award (each vesting date in such vesting schedule, a "Vesting Date") as of the
Effective Time, in each case subject to the holder remaining continuously
employed by or in service to Parent or any of its Affiliates from the Closing
Date through each such Vesting Date; and

c)with respect to a holder of a Parent Restricted Stock Award who has not
remained continuously employed with or in service to Parent or an Affiliate of
Parent, subject to any right to vesting acceleration, or who otherwise does
not satisfy the vesting requirements of his or her Parent Restricted Stock
Award(s), the holder shall permanently forfeit the unvested portion of his or
her Parent Restricted Stock Award(s), such portion shall be retained by
Parent, and such holder shall have no rights in or claims to any such retained
amounts.

(iii)Necessary Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, and subject to the prior
review and approval of Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions
anticipated by this Section 1.3(c) under the Plan and any Contract applicable
to any Company Option (whether written or oral, formal or informal), including
delivering all required notices, obtaining all necessary approvals and
consents, and delivering evidence satisfactory to Parent that all necessary
determinations by the Company's Board of Directors (the "Company Board") or
applicable committee of the Company Board to terminate all Company Options in
accordance with this Section 1.3(c) have been made. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to terminate the Plan prior to the Effective Time.

1.4 Working Capital and Cash Adjustments.

(a)Pre-Closing Statements. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent (i) a statement prepared in
accordance with the Sample Working Capital Statement and that is reasonably
acceptable to Parent acting in good faith (the "Pre-Closing WC Statement")
setting forth in reasonable detail the Company's good faith estimate of
Closing Working Capital (including all components thereof) (such estimate, the
"Estimated Closing Working Capital") and (ii) a written statement (the
"Estimated Closing Statement") setting forth the Company's good faith estimate
of (A) Closing Cash (such estimate, the "Estimated Closing Cash"), (B) Closing
Indebtedness (such estimate, the "Estimated Closing Indebtedness"), and (C)
Closing Third Party Expenses (such estimate, the "Estimated Closing Third
Party Expenses"), in each case, accompanied by reasonably detailed back-up
documentation for such calculations. The Company shall prepare the Pre-Closing
WC Statement in accordance with GAAP as consistently applied by the Company
for pre-Closing periods and, to the extent consistent with GAAP, using the
same accounting principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods, with
consistent classifications, judgments, inclusions, exclusions and valuation
and estimation methodologies that were employed in the preparation of the
Sample Working Capital Statement.

 The Company shall make available to Parent and its Representatives the work
papers (subject to the execution of customary work paper access letters, if
requested) and other books and records used in preparing the Pre-Closing WC
Statement and Estimated Closing Statement and reasonable access to employees
of the Company as Parent may reasonably request in connection with its review
of such statements, and will otherwise cooperate in good faith with Parent's
and its Representatives review of such statements and shall take into
consideration in good faith any comments of Parent on the Pre-Closing WC
Statement or the Estimated Closing Statement, as applicable. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event will any of Parent's rights be considered waived,
impaired or otherwise limited as a result of Parent not making an objection
prior to the Closing or its making an objection that is not fully implemented
in a revised Pre-Closing WC Statement or Estimated Closing Statement, as
applicable. If Parent does not accept the Company's Pre-Closing WC Statement
as set forth herein, Parent shall propose, in good faith and within two (2)
Business Days after delivery of the Pre-Closing WC Statement, Parent's changes
to such Pre-Closing WC Statement (the "Parent Proposed Statement"). If the
Company accepts the Parent Proposed Statement and Parent does not prepare or
provide the Post-Closing WC Statement as set forth in Section 1.4(b) below,
such Parent Proposed Statement shall be deemed the Post-Closing WC Statement
and the dispute procedures set forth in Section 1.4(c) shall apply thereto.

(b)Post-Closing WC Statement; Post-Closing General Statement. As promptly as
practicable, but in no event later than 120 calendar days after the Closing
Date, Parent may prepare and deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered,
to the Stockholders' Representative (i), a statement (the "Post-Closing WC
Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail Parent's calculations of (i)
the Closing Working Capital (including all components thereof), and (ii) a
statement (the "Post-Closing General Statement" and together with the Post-
Closing WC Statement, the "Post-Closing Statements, and each a "Post-Closing
Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail Parent's calculation of Closing
Cash, Closing Indebtedness, and Closing Third Party Expenses, and the Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount (as defined below), in each case accompanied by
reasonably detailed back-up documentation for such calculations. If Parent
prepares a Post-Closing Statement, Parent shall prepare such Post-Closing
Statement in accordance with GAAP as consistently applied by the Company for
pre-Closing periods, and to the extent consistent with GAAP, using the same
accounting principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods, with
consistent classifications, judgments, inclusions, exclusions and valuation
and estimation methodologies that were employed in the preparation of the
Sample Working Capital Statement. If Parent prepares such Post-Closing
Statement, the Company shall make available to Parent and its Representatives
the work papers (subject to the execution of customary work paper access
letters, if requested) and other books and records used in preparing the Pre-
Closing WC Statement and Estimated Closing Statement and reasonable access to
employees of the Company as Parent may reasonably request in connection with
its review of such statements.

(c)Review of Post-Closing Statements. The Stockholders' Representative shall
have forty-five (45) days following its receipt of any Post-Closing Statements
(the "Review Period") to review the Post-Closing Statements. During the Review
Period, the Resolutions Period and any additional period until all items in
the Dispute Statement are finally resolved as provided in Section 1.4(d),
Parent and the Company shall make available to the Stockholders'
Representative and its Representatives the work papers (subject to the
execution of customary work paper access letters, if requested) and other
books and records used in preparing each of the Post-Closing Statements and
reasonable access (on prior notice and during business hours) to employees of
the Company as the Stockholders' Representative (or its Representatives) may
reasonably request in connection with its review of such statements. On or
before the expiration of the Review Period, the Stockholders' Representative
shall deliver to Parent a written statement accepting or disputing each item
set forth on the Post-Closing Statements. In the event that the Stockholders'
Representative disputes an item on a Post-Closing Statement, the Stockholders'
Representative shall deliver to Parent a statement (a "Dispute Statement")
that includes (i) a reasonably detailed itemization of the Stockholders'
Representative's objections and the reasons therefor, together with supporting
documentation, information and calculations and (ii) the Stockholders'
Representative's alternative calculation of each disputed item. Any component
of a Post-Closing Statement that is not disputed in a Dispute Statement shall
be final and binding on the parties hereto and not subject to appeal. If the
Stockholders' Representative does not deliver a Dispute Statement to Parent
within the Review Period or delivers a statement accepting all

 items detailed on one or both of the Post-Closing Statements, such Post-
Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and not
subject to appeal.

(d)Dispute Resolution. If the Stockholders' Representative delivers a Dispute
Statement during the Review Period, Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative shall promptly meet and attempt in good faith to resolve their
differences with respect to the disputed items set forth in the Dispute
Statement during the thirty (30) calendar days immediately following the
Parent's receipt of the Dispute Statement, or such longer period as Parent and
the Stockholders' Representative may mutually agree (the "Resolution Period").
Any such disputed items that are resolved by Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative during the Resolution Period shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto and not subject to appeal. If Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative do not resolve all such disputed items by the end of the
Resolution Period, Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall submit
all items remaining in dispute with respect to the Dispute Statement to Grant
Thornton LLP (the "Accounting Firm") for review and resolution. The Accounting
Firm shall act as an expert and not an arbitrator and if a substitute
Accounting Firm needs to be designated the Stockholders' Representative and
Parent shall agree on a regionally or nationally recognized accounting firm
that has not provided significant services to either party or its subsidiaries
within the two year period prior to the Closing. The Accounting Firm shall
make all calculations in accordance with GAAP as consistently applied by the
Company for pre-Closing periods, and to the extent consistent with GAAP, the
practices used in preparation of the Sample Working Capital Statement, shall
determine only those items remaining in dispute between Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative, and shall not be permitted or authorized to
assign a dollar amount to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value
for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by either party. Each of Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative shall (i) enter into a customary engagement letter with the
Accounting Firm at the time such dispute is submitted to the Accounting Firm
and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the Accounting Firm, (ii) have the
opportunity to submit a written statement in support of their respective
positions with respect to such disputed items, to provide supporting material
to the Accounting Firm in defense of their respective positions with respect
to such disputed items and to submit a written statement responding to the
other party's position with respect to such disputed items and (iii) subject
to customary confidentiality and indemnity agreements, provide the Accounting
Firm with access to their respective books, records, personnel and
representatives and such other information as the Accounting Firm may require
in order to render its determination. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed
to deliver to Parent and the Stockholders' Representative a written
determination (such determination to include a worksheet setting forth all
material calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be based
solely on information provided to the Accounting Firm by Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative) of the disputed items within thirty (30)
calendar days of receipt of the disputed items, which determination shall be
final and binding on the parties hereto and not subject to appeal, absent
manifest error or fraud. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
borne by the Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholders' Representative, on
the other hand, based on a percentage equal to (x) the portion of the total
amounts disputed not awarded to each such party divided by (y) the total
amounts disputed. For example, if the Stockholders' Representative challenges
the calculation of the Closing Working Capital by an amount of $100,000, but
the Accounting Firm determines that the Stockholders' Representative has a
valid claim for only $60,000, the Stockholders' Representative will bear forty
percent (40%) of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and Parent will
bear the other sixty percent (60%) of such fees and expenses.

(e)Post-Closing Payments.

(i)If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is negative, and the absolute value
of such Post-Closing Adjustment Amount (the "Post-Closing Deficit") is greater
than $25,000 (the "Post-Closing Adjustment Threshold"), then the Company
Indemnitors shall owe Parent the full amount of the Post-Closing Deficit,
including the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment Threshold. Payment of any
Post-Closing Deficit shall come, first, from the Escrow Fund and Parent and
the Stockholders' Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent to deliver an amount in cash equal to the amount of the Post-
Closing Deficit from the Escrow Fund. For avoidance of doubt, any recovery of
any such Post-Closing Deficit shall not be subject to any of the limitations
on indemnification set forth in Section 8.3.

 (ii)If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is positive, and the absolute value
of such Post-Closing Adjustment Amount (the "Post-Closing Increase") is
greater than the Post-Closing Adjustment Threshold, then Parent shall, no
later than five (5) Business Days after the final determination of the Post-
Closing Adjustment Amount pursuant to this Section 1.4, pay the Post-Closing
Increase to the Payment Agent for further distribution (1) to the Company
Stockholders and holders of applicable Non-Employee Company Options in
accordance with their applicable Escrow Pro Rata Portions and (2) to the
Surviving Corporation for distribution to the holders of applicable Employee
Company Options in accordance with their applicable Escrow Pro Rata Portions
through the Surviving Corporation's payroll, subject to withholding and other
customary deductions.

(iii)"Post-Closing Adjustment Amount" means the net amount (if disputed, as
finally determined in accordance with this Section 1.4) which may be positive
or negative (as to the overall net amount and each component used in the
calculation of such net amount), equal to

(A)the Closing Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this Section
1.4 minus the Estimated Closing Working Capital as set forth on the Pre-
Closing WC Statement; plus

(B)the Closing Cash, as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.4, minus
the Estimated Closing Cash, as set forth on the Estimated Closing Statement;
plus

(C)the Estimated Closing Third Party Expenses, as set forth on the Estimated
Closing Statement, minus the Closing Third Party Expenses, as finally
determined in accordance with this Section 1.4; plus

(D)the Estimated Closing Indebtedness, as set forth on the Estimated Closing
Statement, minus the Closing Indebtedness, as finally determined in accordance
with this Section 1.4.

(f)Any payment made under this Section 1.4 or Article VIII, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law, shall be treated, including for all Tax
purposes, as an adjustment to the Total Merger Consideration.

1.5 Further Action. If at any time from and after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and the officers and directors of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub, are fully authorized in the name of their
respective corporations or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful
and necessary action.

subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement. The
proceeds in the Escrow Fund shall be distributed to the Company Indemnitors,
in accordance with their applicable Escrow Pro Rata Portions, and to Parent at
the times, and upon the terms and conditions, set forth in this Agreement and

approval and adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the
Company Stockholders and their execution and delivery of

 the Company Stockholder Consent constitutes approval by such Company
Indemnitors, as specific terms of the Merger, and the irrevocable agreement of

Encumbrance, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any
creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the purposes
and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
For any portion of the Escrow Fund released for the benefit of the Company
Indemnitors, the portion of the Escrow Fund payable in respect of Company
Capital Stock and in respect of applicable Non-Employee Company Options shall
be paid to the Payment Agent for further distribution to such recipients based
on their Escrow Pro Rata Portions, and the portion of the Escrow Fund payable

of such Employee Company Options through the payroll system of the Surviving
Corporation and subject to deduction for withholding taxes and similar

(iii)Expense Cash. At the Closing (or, if the wire deadline is missed, in no
event later than one Business Day following the Closing), Parent shall

Closing), Parent shall, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, on
behalf of the Company and the Company Indemnitors, as the case may be, and as
accounted for in the calculation of Total Merger Consideration, (i) to each
lender designated by the Company on the Closing Spreadsheet, to an account
designated in the applicable Payoff Letter, the amount of Indebtedness due at
Closing to such lender and (ii) all Third Party Expenses payable to an advisor
or other service provider to the Company (other than any employee, director or
officer) that remain outstanding as of the Closing to such account or accounts
as are designated in the applicable Invoices and by the Company in the Closing
Spreadsheet.

(d)Payment Procedures.

(i)As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, Parent shall cause
the Payment Agent to mail a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit H (the "Letter of Transmittal") to each Company Stockholder and
each Non-Employee Company Option Holder at the address set forth opposite each
such Person's name on the Closing Spreadsheet.

(ii)For Company Stockholders, after receipt by the Payment Agent of a Letter
of Transmittal (with respect to shares of Company Capital Stock) and any other
documents (including applicable Tax forms and a duly executed Joinder
Agreement) that Parent or the Payment Agent may reasonably require in
connection therewith (the "Exchange Documents"), duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and the original
certificate representing shares of Company Capital Stock (a "Company Stock
Certificate") or Affidavit of Loss therefor, Parent shall cause the Payment
Agent to pay to the holder of such Company Stock Certificate in exchange
therefor that portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereto
pursuant to Section 1.3(b) (less (x) the cash amounts to be withheld and
deposited in the Escrow Fund on such holder's behalf pursuant to Section
2.3(b)(ii), and, if applicable, (y) the cash amounts to be deposited with the
Stockholders' Representative on such holder's behalf pursuant to Section
2.3(b)(iii)), and the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be
cancelled.

 No portion of the Merger Consideration shall be paid or payable to the holder
of any Company Stock Certificate until the holder of record of such Company
Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate (or Affidavit
of Loss therefor) and validly executed Exchange Documents in accordance with
the terms and conditions hereof.

(iii)For Non-Employee Company Option Holders, after receipt by the Payment
Agent of the Exchange Documents and any other documents (including applicable
Tax forms) that Parent or the Payment Agent may reasonably require in
connection therewith (which for the avoidance of doubt, will not include a
Joinder Agreement), each of which shall be duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, Parent shall cause the Payment
Agent to pay to the applicable Non-Employee Company Option Holder in exchange
therefor that portion of the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereto
pursuant to Sections 1.3(c)(i) and (ii) (as applicable). No portion of the
Merger Consideration shall be paid or payable to a Non-Employee Company Option
Holder without executed Exchange Documents in accordance with the terms and
conditions hereof.

(e)Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Company Stock
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such amount, if
any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.3; provided, however, that
Parent may, in its reasonable discretion, or as required by the Payment Agent,
and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the Person who
is the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to provide an
indemnification agreement (but not a bond) in a form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Parent, against any claim that may be made against Parent or the
Payment Agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

(f)Transfers of Ownership. If any cash amounts are to be disbursed pursuant to
Section 1.3(b) to a Person other than the Person whose name is reflected on
the Company Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it will be a
condition of the issuance or delivery thereof that the certificate so
surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent
or any agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of any portion of the Total Merger Consideration in any name
other than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or
established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(g)Payment Agent to Return Merger Consideration. At any time following the
date that is six months following the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled
to require the Payment Agent to deliver to Parent or its designated successor
or assign all cash amounts that have been deposited with the Payment Agent
pursuant to Section 2.3(b), and any and all interest thereon or other income
or proceeds thereof, not disbursed to the holders of Company Stock
Certificates pursuant to Section 2.3(d), and thereafter the holders of Company
Stock Certificates shall be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to the
terms of Section 2.3(i)) only as general creditors thereof with respect to any

(h)No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. The cash amounts paid
in respect of the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to be full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company

 Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the

portion of the Total Merger Consideration that remains unclaimed immediately

property, escheat or similar Law shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

2.4 Withholding. The Company, the Payment Agent, the Escrow Agent, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Stockholders' Representative and any representative

provision of federal, local or foreign Tax Law or under any Laws or Orders,
and shall be provided any necessary Tax forms, including IRS Form W-9 or the
appropriate series of IRS Form W-8, as applicable, or any similar information.
To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

2.5 Tax Consequences. Notwithstanding any statement or inference to the
contrary in any provision of this Agreement or any other agreement, except for
representations and warranties made to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this
Agreement, no party shall be considered to have made any representations or
warranties regarding the Tax treatment of the Transactions, or any of the Tax
consequences to the Company or any Company Indemnitor of this Agreement, or
any other aspect of the Transactions. The Company acknowledges that the
Company and the Company Indemnitors are relying solely on their own Tax
advisors in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.

 each case in connection with the Transactions or upon termination of

has neither received nor requested any private letter ruling from the IRS (or
any comparable Tax ruling from any other Tax Authority). No power of attorney
with respect to Taxes has been granted with respect to the Company that
remains in effect.

(c)The Company Balance Sheet reflects all Liabilities for unpaid Taxes of the

 Company was not the ultimate parent corporation, (ii) ever been a party to or

Employee Plan or other Contract, plan, program, agreement, or arrangement. The
Company is not a party to, or otherwise obligated under, any Contract that
provides for the gross-up of Taxes imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of

 the Code. No event has occurred that would be treated by Section 409A(b) as a
transfer of property for purposes of Section 83 of the Code.

(q)The exercise price of all Company Options is at least equal to the fair
market value of the Company Common Stock on the date such Company Options were
granted or repriced, and neither the Company nor Parent has incurred or will
incur any Liability or obligation to withhold Taxes under Section 409A of the

any other such agreements, plans, arrangements or other Contracts, will, or
would reasonably be expected to, as a result of the Transactions (whether

be expected to give rise directly or indirectly to the payment of any amount
that could reasonably be expected to be non-deductible under Section 162 of
the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law) or be characterized as a "parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law). Schedule 3.7(r) of the Company Disclosure Letter

Company Employee Plan, including any audit or inquiry by any Governmental
Entity, including, without limitation, the IRS or United States Department of
Labor.

Plan for the most recent full fiscal year included in the Financial
Statements.

or recommend (or publicly propose or announce any intention or desire to agree
to, accept, approve, endorse or recommend) any Acquisition Proposal, (iv)
enter into any letter of intent or any other Contract contemplating or
otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal, or (v) submit any Acquisition
Proposal to the vote of any stockholders of the Company. The Company will, and
will cause its Representatives to, (A) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any Persons conducted prior to or on the Agreement Date with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and (B) immediately revoke or withdraw access of any
Person (other than Parent and its Representatives) to any data room (virtual
or actual) containing any non-public information with respect to the Company
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal and request from each Person (other
than Parent and its Representatives) the prompt return or destruction of all
non-public information with respect to the Company previously provided to such
Person in connection with an Acquisition Proposal. If any of the Company's
Representatives, whether in his, her or its capacity as such or in any other
capacity, takes any action that the Company is obligated pursuant to this
Section 6.2 not to authorize or permit such Representative to take, then the
Company shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have breached
this Section 6.2.

(b) The Company shall immediately (but in any event, within 24 hours) notify
Parent in writing after receipt by the Company (or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, by any of its Representatives), of (i) any Acquisition Proposal, or
(ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or for
access to any of the properties, books or records of the Company by any Person
or Persons other than Parent and its Representatives. Such notice shall
describe the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall keep Parent fully informed of the status and details of, and any
modification to, any such inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer
and any correspondence or communications related thereto.

6.3 Confidentiality; Public Disclosure.

(a)The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously
executed that certain Non-Disclosure Agreement dated February 15, 2018, by and
between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. Each party
hereto agrees that this Agreement, and the fact of this Agreement's existence,
are Confidential Information subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement. At no time before the Merger shall the Company, or before or after
the Merger, shall the Company Equity Holders or Stockholders' Representative,
disclose any of the terms of this Agreement (including the economic terms) or
any non-public information about a party hereto to any other Person without
the prior written consent of Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in the foregoing, a party hereto shall be permitted to disclose any and all
terms to its financial, tax and legal advisors (each of whom is subject to a
similar obligation of confidentiality), and to any Governmental Entity or
administrative agency to the extent necessary or advisable in compliance with
applicable Law and the rules of the primary exchange on which such party is
then listed. The Stockholders' Representative hereby agrees to be bound by the
terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement to the same extent as
though the Stockholders' Representative were a party thereto. With respect to
the Stockholders' Representative, as used in the Confidentiality Agreement,
the term "Confidential Information" shall also include information relating to
the Merger or this Agreement received by the Stockholders' Representative
after the Closing or relating to the period after the Closing.

 (b)The Company shall not, and the Company shall cause each of its
Representatives not to, issue any press release or other public communications
relating to the terms of this Agreement or the Transactions or use Parent's
name or refer to Parent directly or indirectly in connection with Parent's
relationship with the Company in any media interview, advertisement, news
release, press release or professional or trade publication, or in any print
media, whether or not in response to an inquiry, without the prior written
approval of Parent, unless required by applicable Law (after such party's
outside legal counsel determines such disclosure is required) and except as
reasonably necessary for the Company to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval and the other consents and approvals of the Company Stockholders and
other third parties contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement, Parent
may be permitted to make such public communications regarding this Agreement
or the Transactions as Parent may determine is reasonable and appropriate.

6.4 Reasonable Best Efforts. Each of the parties hereto agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts, and to cooperate with each other party hereto, to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, appropriate or desirable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other Transactions, including the satisfaction of the respective conditions
set forth in Section 2.2, and including to execute and deliver such other
instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be necessary
or reasonably desirable for effecting completely the consummation of the
Merger and the other Transactions (including the conditions to effect the RandW
Policy). Parent and Merger Sub will not, and will cause their Affiliates to
not, take any action (including agreeing to, entering into or consummating any
merger, acquisition or transaction) that is intended to or has, or would
reasonably be expected to have, the effect of preventing, impairing,
materially delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the consummation of the
Transactions.

6.5 Third-Party Consents; Notices.

(a)The Company shall, upon Parent's request, use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain prior to the Closing, and deliver to Parent at or prior to
the Closing, all consents, waivers and approvals under each Contract listed or
described on Schedule 2.2(b)(ix)(A)) (and any Contract entered into after the
Agreement Date that would have been required to be listed or described on
Schedule 2.2(b)(ix)(A)) if entered into prior to the Agreement Date) (as
applicable).

(b)The Company shall give all notices and other information required to be
given to the employees of the Company, any collective bargaining unit
representing any group of employees of the Company, and any applicable
government authority under the WARN Act, the National Labor Relations Act, as
amended, the Code, and other applicable Law in connection with the
Transactions.

6.6 Actions. The Company shall (i) notify Parent in writing promptly after
learning of any Action initiated by or against it, or known by the Company to
be threatened against the Company, or any of its directors, officers or
employees or current or former Company Stockholders in their capacity as such
(a "New Litigation Claim"), (ii) notify Parent of ongoing material
developments in any New Litigation Claim or any litigation claim pending
against the Company as of the Agreement Date and (iii) consult in good faith
with Parent regarding the conduct of the defense of any New Litigation Claim.

6.7 Access to Information.

(a)During the period from the Agreement Date and continuing until the earlier
of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, and subject to
applicable Law, (i) the Company shall afford Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during business hours to (A) the Company's properties,
personnel, books, Contracts and records and (B) all other information
concerning the business,

 properties and personnel of the Company as Parent may reasonably request and
to the extent such information is in the possession of the Company or easily
obtainable, and (ii) the Company shall provide to Parent and its

has been a party, and (D) receipts for any Taxes paid to foreign Tax

the contrary, without first obtaining the prior written consent of the
Company's Chief Executive Officer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, Parent and its Representatives (x) shall not contact any of the
Company's employees other than Key Employees, and (y) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to not contact Customers in the Customers' role as
customers of the Company, with the intent of discussing the Company's
business; provided that nothing in this clause (y) shall prohibit Parent or
its Representatives from contacting Customers in the ordinary course of
Parent's business or responding to Customers that have contacted Parent or its
Representatives.

(b)Subject to compliance with applicable Law, from the Agreement Date until
the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the Closing, the Company
shall confer from time to time as requested by Parent with one or more
Representatives of Parent to discuss any material changes or developments in
the operational matters of the Company and the general status of the ongoing
operations of the Company.

(c)No information obtained by Parent during the pendency of the Transactions
in any investigation pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, obligation or
condition set forth herein.

respective legal, auditors', financial advisors' and other representatives'
fees and other expenses incurred with respect to this Agreement and the

6.10 [Reserved.]

6.11 Corporate Matters. The Company shall retain at its Massachusetts office,
and make available to Parent, the minute books containing the records of all
proceedings, consents, actions and meetings of the board of directors,
committees of the boards of directors and the stockholders of the Company and
the stock ledgers, journals and other records reflecting all stock issuances
and transfers.

6.12 Tax Matters.

(a)Cooperation. Each of Parent, the Stockholders' Representative and the
Company shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
any of the others, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any Action
with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
request therefor) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant
to any such Action and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. Parent, the Company, and the Stockholders' Representative
agree to (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until expiration of the statute of limitations of the respective
taxable periods plus ninety (90) days, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Tax Authority, and (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so
requests, Parent and the Stockholders' Representative, as the case may be,
shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and records;
provided, however, neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates (which will
include the Surviving Corporation following the Closing) shall have any
obligations or responsibilities with respect to such matters addressed in
clause (i) of this sentence (other than with respect to agreements entered
into with a Governmental Entity) beyond those set forth under Parent's general
policy on records retention. The Company shall cause each Company Equity
Holder to further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Entity or any
other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed (including with respect to the Transactions).

(b)Pre-Closing Tax Returns. At Parent's expense, Parent shall prepare and
timely file or cause to be prepared and timely filed (taking into account all
extensions properly obtained) all Tax Returns

 of the Company first due after the Closing Date that include any Pre-Closing
Tax Period and are indicated on Schedule 3.7(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter (such Tax Returns, the "Parent Prepared Returns"). Parent shall prepare
Parent Prepared Returns for any taxable period that ends on or before the
Closing Date in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Company, to
the extent consistent with applicable Law and subject to Section 6.12(c)
below. Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for any Parent
Prepared Return, taking into account extension (or if such due date is within
thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date), Parent shall provide the Stockholders'
Representative with a draft copy of such Tax Return for review and comments.
Parent shall, in good faith, consider any changes to any Parent Prepared
Return suggested by the Stockholders' Representative. The Company Equity
Holders shall be responsible for reimbursing Parent or the Company for any
Pre-Closing Taxes shown as due on such Tax Returns (to the extent such Tax
Returns were filed in a manner consistent with Section 6.12(c) below) promptly
upon request by Parent (to the extent such Pre-Closing Taxes are not reflected
in the Closing Working Capital).

(c)Certain Post-Closing Actions. From and after the Closing, neither Parent,
the Company, nor any of their respective Affiliates shall, without the express
written consent of Stockholders' Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, (i) amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax Return
relating in whole or in part to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or with respect to
the portion of any Straddle Tax Period ending on or before the Closing Date)
of the Company to the extent such amendment would give rise to liability for
any Pre-Closing Tax or a breach of the Tax Representations (a "Tax Liability")
unless such amendment, refiling or modification is otherwise required by
applicable Law; (ii) make, or cause to be made, any Tax election, or adopt or
change any method of accounting with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Period,
that would give rise to a Tax Liability; (iii) enter into any voluntary
disclosure agreement with respect to Taxes of the Company for any tax period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date, or (iv) file Tax Returns for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in a
jurisdiction where the same has not previously filed Tax Returns unless such
filing is required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary in this Section 6.12(c), Parent, Company or their respective
Affiliates may take the actions set forth in clauses (ii) or (iii) herein
without the consent of the Stockholders' Representative; provided, that if
Parent, Company or their respective Affiliates do take any such action without
the consent of the Stockholders' Representative, the Indemnified Parties shall
not make or be entitled to indemnification for any claims arising from such
actions and the Company Indemnitors shall have no liability for any Losses
related thereto pursuant to Section 8 herein.

(d)Transfer Taxes. All Transfer Taxes will be paid 50% by Parent and 50% by
the Company Equity Holders when due, and the Company Equity Holders will, at
their own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Transfer Taxes.

6.13 Parachute Payment Waivers. The Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent
prior to the initiation of the requisite stockholder approval procedure under
Section 6.14, a Parachute Payment Waiver from each Person who the Company
reasonably believes could be, with respect to the Company and/or any ERISA
Affiliate, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined
immediately prior to the initiation of the requisite stockholder approval
procedure under Section 6.14 and who might otherwise have, receive or have the
right or entitlement to receive a Section 280G Payment (as defined below) to
the extent the value thereof exceeds 2.99 times such Person's "base amount"
determined in accordance with Section 280G of the Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, provided, however, that Parent reasonably cooperates
with the Company, as needed and reasonably requested by the Company, in the
completion of the foregoing mathematical analysis, including by providing
relevant compensation or other benefit information required by the Company the

 Company to complete such analysis. Prior to soliciting any such waiver, the
Company shall provide a copy of the form waiver to Parent, for its review and
reasonable approval.

6.14 280G Stockholder Approval. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall submit to the Company Stockholders for
approval (in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent), by such number of
holders of Company Stockholders as is required by the terms of Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments and/or benefits that may separately or
in the aggregate, constitute "parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of
the Code ("Section 280G Payments") (which determination shall be made by the
Company and shall be subject to review and reasonable approval by Parent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld), such that such payments and
benefits shall not be deemed to be Section 280G Payments, and prior to the
Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent written notification and
documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent that (i) a vote of the holders
of Company Capital Stock was solicited in conformance with Section 280G of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder and the requisite stockholder
approval was obtained with respect to any payments and/or benefits that were
subject to the stockholder vote (the "280G Stockholder Approval") or (ii) that
the 280G Stockholder Approval was not obtained and as a consequence, that such
payments and/or benefits shall not be made or provided to the extent they
would cause any amounts to constitute Section 280G Payments, pursuant to the
Parachute Payment Waivers that were executed by the affected individuals prior
to the solicitation of the vote of the holders of Company Capital Stock
pursuant to this Section 6.14.

6.15 Director and Officer Indemnification.

(a)Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase, at the Company
Stockholders' expense, an extended reporting period endorsement (the "Company
DandO Tail Policy") under the Company's existing directors' and officers'
liability and errors and omission insurance coverage for the Company's
directors and officers on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent that shall
provide such directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years following
the Effective Time and that provides at least the same coverage in scope and
amount as the existing coverage and have other terms not materially less
favorable in the aggregate to the insured persons than the directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company.
The cost of any Company DandO Tail Policy shall be considered a Third Party
Expense for purposes of this Agreement. At or prior to the Closing, the
Company shall provide a copy of the Company DandO Tail Policy to Parent, along
with written confirmation from the insurance provider that the Company DandO
Tail Policy will be bound at Closing.

(b)From and after the Effective Time, and until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and
honor in all respects the obligations of the Company to Persons who on or
prior to the Effective Time are or were directors and/or officers of the
Company (the "Company Indemnified Parties") pursuant to any indemnification
provisions under the Charter Documents and pursuant to any indemnification
agreements between the Company and such Company Indemnified Parties that are
listed on Schedule 6.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter; provided,
however, that (i) the foregoing obligations shall be subject to any limitation
imposed by applicable Laws, and (ii) no Company Indemnified Party shall have
any right of contribution, indemnification or right of advancement from
Parent, Surviving Corporation, or their respective successors with respect to
any Losses claimed by any of the Indemnified Parties against such Company
Indemnified Party in his or her capacity as a Company Indemnitor pursuant to
this Agreement.

(c)If the Surviving Corporation (or any of its successors or assigns) (a)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (b)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any other
Person

 (including by dissolution, liquidation, assignment for the benefit of
creditors or similar action), then, and in each such case, Parent will use
commercially reasonable efforts, which for the avoidance of doubt shall not
include any cost or expense, to cause proper provision to be made so that such
other Person fully assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 6.15.

(d)The provisions of this Section 6.15 shall survive the Closing. This Section
6.15 shall be for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the Company Indemnified Parties and his or her respective heirs,
executors, administrators, estates, successors and assigns, and each such
Person shall be an express intended third party beneficiary of this Agreement
for such purposes.

6.16 Charter Amendment. Promptly following Parent's public announcement of the
execution of this Agreement, but in no event later than one (1) Business Day
prior to the mailing of the Stockholder Notice, the Company shall file the
Charter Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.

6.17 Employment Matters.

(a)Prior to the Closing, Parent shall provide an Offer Letter of at-will
employment to each Employee listed on Schedule 6.17(b)-1 and on Schedule
6.17(b)-2 (with each such individual, other than a Key Employee, who accepts
the Offer Letter, a "Continuing Employee"). During the period commencing at
the Closing and ending on the date which is twelve (12) months from the
Closing (or if earlier, the date of the employee's termination of employment
with the Company), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
provide each Continuing Employee with an annual base salary or hourly wage
rate, as applicable, and annual base salary or hourly wage rate plus annual
cash bonus opportunity, in the aggregate, no less favorable than that provided
to such Continuing Employee by the Company immediately prior to the Closing.

(b)At or as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, Parent shall
grant retention awards in the form of cash and/or equity-based awards as set
forth herein (the "Retention Payments"). Schedule 6.17(b)-1 attached hereto
sets forth each individual that is entitled to receive a Retention Payment if
the conditions to the Retention Payment as set forth below are met, the amount
of such Retention Payment and the allocation among cash and equity-based
awards applicable thereto (such individuals being the "Retention Payment
Recipients"). Each such Retention Payment Recipient will receive such award if
such Retention Payment Recipient (i) has delivered to Parent an executed Key
Employee Offer Letter or Offer Letter (as applicable), in each case, effective
on the first Business Day after the Closing Date, (ii) shall not have
terminated his or her employment with the Company or expressed an intention
(whether formally or informally) in terminating his or her employment with the
Surviving Corporation or Parent following the Closing and (iii) shall continue
to provide services to Parent and its Affiliates following the Closing through
the applicable grant or award date. Parent shall not change the identity of
any Retention Payment Recipient, the allocation of cash and equity for such
retention amount, or the amount allocated to such Retention Payment Recipient,
all as set forth on Schedule 6.17(b)-1, without the prior written consent of
Zackary King.

(c)Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall have approved a performance bonus
plan, in substantially the form set forth as Exhibit I hereto (the
"Performance Bonus Plan"), which plan shall be effective at and contingent
upon the Effective Time. The initial Covered Participants (as defined in the
Performance Bonus Plan) and the amounts allocated to each such Covered
Participant are set forth on Schedule 6.17(b)-2.

(d)Following the Closing, Parent shall also grant to those Employees set forth
on Schedule 6.17(b)-3 hereto a Parent Restricted Stock Award, in the amounts
to be determined by Parent prior

 to Closing, provided that Parent shall consult with the Company's Chief
Executive Officer in good faith prior to determining such amounts, provided
such Employee (i) has delivered to Parent an executed Offer Letter, in each
case, effective on the first Business Day after the Closing Date, (ii) shall
not have terminated his or her employment with the Company or expressed an
intention (whether formally or informally) in terminating his or her
employment with the Surviving Corporation or Parent following the Closing,
(iii) shall have executed a Parent Restricted Stock Award Agreement, including
a release in favor of Parent and its Affiliates, and otherwise complied with
the terms and conditions of a Parent Restricted Stock Award under Section
1.3(c)(ii)(C), and (iv) continues to provide services to Parent and its
Affiliates following the Closing through the applicable grant date.

(e)This Section 6.17 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.17,
express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person, including any current
or former Employee, independent contractor, or consultant, any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.17.
Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish,
amend or modify any plan, program, arrangement, agreement, policy or
commitment. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth
in this Section 6.17 shall not create any right in any Employee, independent
contractor, or consultant that receives any such retention award or in any
other Person to continued employment with the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

such that the conditions set forth in Sections 2.2(b)(i) and 2.2(b)(ii) would
not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or inaccuracy and such breach
or inaccuracy has not been cured within ten (10) calendar days after written
notice thereof to the Company; provided, however, that no cure period shall be
required (i) for a breach or inaccuracy which by its nature cannot be cured or

benefit of Parent are incapable of being satisfied on or before the End Date;
or

(d)by the Company if it is not in material breach of its obligations under

remain liable for any material breaches of this Agreement, Related Agreements
or in any certificate or other instruments delivered pursuant to this
Agreement prior to its termination; and provided further, however, that, the
provisions of Sections 6.3 (Confidentiality; Public Disclosure), 6.9
(Expenses), Article X (General Provisions) and this Section 7.2 shall remain
in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of this Article VII.

ARTICLE VIII 
POST-CLOSING INDEMNIFICATION

8.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties.

(a)Company Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in this Agreement or in the Officer's Certificate
shall survive until 11:59 p.m. (New York time) on the date that is twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date; provided, however, that in the event of
fraud with respect to a representation or warranty, such representation or
warranty shall survive until, and the Indemnified Parties may only make a
claim for fraud pursuant to this Agreement until, the date that is six (6)
years following the Closing Date and; provided, further, that (i) the
Fundamental Representations shall survive the Closing and continue in full
force and effect until the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable
to the subject matter of such representations or warranties and not general
breach of contracts claims, and (ii) the Tax Representations shall survive the
Closing and shall continue in full force and effect until the date that is six
(6) years following the Closing Date; provided, further, that all
representations or warranties of the Company shall survive beyond the

of fraud shall survive as to such claim until such claim has been fully and
finally resolved. The date on which a representation or warranty or claim for
fraud expires is referred to as the "Expiration Date." For the avoidance of
doubt, it is the intention of the parties hereto that the foregoing respective
survival periods and termination dates supersede any applicable statutes of
limitations that would otherwise apply to such representations and warranties
under applicable Law. The expiration of any representation and warranty of the
Company shall not affect any indemnification claim for breaches of
representations or warranties of the Company with respect to the matters set
forth in a corresponding written Indemnification Claim Notice if a written
Indemnification Claim Notice with respect to such indemnification claim is
delivered in accordance with Section 8.4 below prior to the Expiration Date of
such representation and warranty.

(a)From and after and by virtue of the Merger, the Company Indemnitors shall
(i) jointly, to the extent of the funds then available in the Escrow Fund, and
(ii) as to any amounts exceeding

accordance with each Company Indemnitor's Indemnity Pro Rata Portion),
indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its directors, officers, employees,
affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation), agents and other
representatives (the " Indemnified Parties"), from and against all Losses
paid, incurred, suffered or sustained by the Indemnified Parties, or any of
them (regardless of whether or not such Losses relate to any third party
claims), resulting from or arising out of any of the following:

(i)any breach of or inaccuracy in, or failure to be true, as of the date of
this Agreement or as of the Effective Time as if made as of the Effective Time
(except in the case of representations and warranties which by their terms
speak only as of a specific date or dates, in which case such representations
and warranties shall be true and correct on and as of such specified date or
dates), a representation or warranty of the Company (other than the
Fundamental Representations or Tax Representations) contained in this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Joinder Agreements or any certificate
delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(xv)(A), (C) or (D);

(ii)any breach of or inaccuracy in, or failure to be true, as of the date of
this Agreement or as of the Effective Time as if made as of the Effective Time
(except in the case of representations and warranties which by their terms
speak only as of a specific date or dates, in which case such representations
and warranties shall be true and correct on and as of such specified date or
dates), any Fundamental Representation and Tax Representation;

(iii)any failure by the Company (and not Parent or its Affiliates) to perform
or comply with any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement, the Joinder Agreement or any certificate delivered by
the Company pursuant to Section 2.2(b)(xv)(A), (C) or (D);

(iv)regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Company
Disclosure Letter, (A) any inaccuracy in any information, or breach of any

claim by or on behalf of any Person that such Person is entitled to receive,
in respect of such Company Securities, any amounts in excess of the amounts
indicated on the Closing Spreadsheet in connection with the Transaction;

(v)regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Company
Disclosure Letter, any Closing Third Party Expenses or Closing Indebtedness,
in each case, to the extent not included in the calculation of Total Merger
Consideration;

(vi)any Post-Closing Deficit owed pursuant to Section 1.4(e);

fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending
against or settling any action or proceeding in respect of Dissenting Shares;
and

 (ix)regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Company
Disclosure Letter, any Pre-Closing Taxes to the extent not included in the

(b)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for purposes of Sections
8.2(a)(i) and 8.2(a)(ii), a breach of a representation or warranty shall be
determined without regard to any qualification based on materiality, Company
Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifier contained in such representation
or warranty; provided, however, that, in no event shall (A) "Material
Contract" be read to mean "Contract" or (B) the term "Company Material Adverse
Effect" be read out of Section 3.6(f)(ii). The rights of the Indemnified
Parties to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement, payment of Losses
or any other remedy under this Agreement shall not be affected by any
investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by the Company or any other matter. The waiver of any condition
based on the accuracy of any such representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any such covenant or agreement, will not
affect the right to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement, payment of
Losses, or any other remedy based on any such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement. Other than with respect to any claim for fraud, no
Indemnified Party shall be required to show reliance on any representation,
warranty, certificate or other agreement in order for such Indemnified Party
to be entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement hereunder.
Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or any other
Indemnified Party to pursue remedies under any Related Agreement against the
parties thereto.

(c)The Company Indemnitors (including any Company Indemnitor who served as an
officer or director of the Company), solely in their capacity as Company
Indemnitors, shall not have any right of contribution, indemnification or
right of advancement from the Surviving Corporation or Parent with respect to
any Loss claimed by an Indemnified Party; provided, however, that if a Company
Indemnitor served as a director or officer of the Company prior to the
Effective Time (i) nothing in this Agreement, including this clause (c), shall
be construed, interpreted or applied so as to prejudice such director's or
officer's rights (or their respective Affiliate's rights) in his or her role
as a former officer or director of the Company (and not in such director's or
officer's (or any respective Affiliate's) role as a Company Indemnitor) to
coverage under the Company DandO Tail Policy or under the indemnification
provisions in existence in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, By laws
or any indemnification as each was in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) nothing in this Agreement, including this clause (c)
shall apply to or otherwise prejudice any claim as to which Federal Insurance
Company ("Federal") may be subrogated under Article VII (Subrogation) of the
General Terms and Conditions of the liability insurance policy issued by
Federal (Policy Number 8240-1954).

(d)This Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified
Parties (as defined below) from and after the Effective Time for any claims
arising under this Agreement, including claims of any inaccuracy in or breach
of any representation, warranty or covenant in this Agreement; provided,
however, that (i) this Section 8.2(d) shall not be deemed a waiver by any
party of any right to specific performance or injunctive relief to the extent
available and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of a
Company Indemnitor (and this Article VIII shall not be the sole and exclusive
remedy for such Indemnified Party) in connection with a claim based on fraud
committed by, or with the actual knowledge of, such Company Indemnitor.

8.3 Limitations on Indemnification.

 (a)Except in the case of fraud, the Indemnified Parties, as a group, may not
recover any Losses pursuant to an indemnification claim under Section
8.2(a)(i) unless and until the Indemnified Parties, as a group, shall have
paid, incurred, suffered or sustained at least $100,000 in Losses in the
aggregate (the "Basket Amount"), in which case the Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to recover all Losses, including the Basket Amount, paid,
incurred, suffered or sustained by the Indemnified Parties as a group.

(b)Subject to Section 8.3(c) and except in the case of fraud, the Indemnified
Parties' sole and exclusive sources of recovery for indemnification claims
under Section 8.2(a)(i) shall be recourse against (i) the cash held in the
Escrow Fund and (ii) the RandW Policy. The conditions and limitations set forth
in this Section 8.3(b), will apply even if (1) the RandW Policy is revoked,
cancelled or modified in any manner after issuance or (2) Parent makes a claim
under the RandW Policy and such claim is denied by the insurer.

(c)Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 8.3(a) and 8.3(b), the
Indemnified Parties shall (i) be entitled to bring indemnification claims
directly against the Company Stockholders in their roles as Company
Indemnitors and (ii) be permitted to recover Losses directly from the Company
Stockholders for indemnification claims pursuant to Sections 8.2(a)(ii)
through 8.2(a)(ix), and Section 8.2(a)(i) only with respect to claims for
fraud, if and only to the extent that (x) the Escrow Fund is no longer
available and (y) such claim has not been satisfied from the RandW Policy (after
compliance with Section 8.3(d)), it being agreed that the Indemnified Parties
shall look first to the Escrow Fund and the RandW Policy; provided, that in each
case of clause (i) and (ii), if the subject matter of such indemnification
claim is expressly excluded from coverage pursuant to and as set forth in the
RandW Policy, the Indemnified Parties shall have no obligation to look to the
RandW Policy for recovery of Losses but rather shall look first to the Escrow
Fund and thereafter directly to the Company Indemnitors for recovery of
Losses. In no event shall the liability of any Company Indemnitor for any
indemnification claim under Section 8.2(a)(ii) through Section 8.2(a)(ix)
exceed the Merger Consideration actually received by such Company Indemnitor
(including any funds from the Escrow Fund), unless such indemnity claim is
being made in respect of fraud and such Company Indemnitor either committed or
had actual knowledge of such fraud (in which event there shall be no
limitation on the liability of such Company Indemnitor hereunder or under
applicable Law except to the extent imposed under applicable Law).

(d)The amount of any Losses that are subject to indemnification under this
Article VIII shall be calculated net of the amount of any insurance proceeds,
indemnification payments or reimbursements actually received by the
Indemnified Parties from third parties (other than the Company Indemnitors) in
respect of such Losses (net of any costs or expenses incurred in obtaining
such insurance, indemnification or reimbursement, including any increases in
insurance premiums or retro-premium adjustments resulting from such recovery),
provided, that, except as set forth in the following sentence, nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed as or give rise to an obligation to seek any such
insurance, indemnification or reimbursement. Except for claims under this
Article VIII related to fraud, for all indemnification claims under Section
8.2(a)(i), (ii) and (ix), Parent agrees to first use commercially reasonable
efforts to seek and obtain recovery under the RandW Policy before seeking
indemnification directly from the Company Indemnitors for any Losses; provided
further that the Indemnified Parties may provide the Stockholders'
Representative with notice of an indemnification claim at any time for
purposes of tolling the expiration of rights to indemnification under Section
8.1. Except for claims under this Article VIII related to fraud, if (a) an
indemnification claim under Section 8.2(a)(iii) for a breach of covenant in
Article V could be brought as an indemnification claim for a breach of a
representation or warranty under Section 8.2(a)(i) or Section 8.2(a)(ii), (b)
the subject matter of such representation or warranty claim is not expressly
excluded from coverage pursuant to and as set forth in the RandW Policy, and (c)
the Expiration Date for such representation or warranty has not yet occurred,
Parent agrees to bring that indemnification claim first as a breach of
representation or

 warranty under Section 8.2(a)(i) or Section 8.2(a)(ii) and to use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek and obtain recovery under the RandW Policy before
seeking indemnification directly from the Company Indemnitors for any Losses;
provided that the Indemnified Parties may provide the Stockholders'
Representative with notice of an indemnification claim at any time for
purposes of tolling the expiration of rights to indemnification under Section
8.1\. In the event that an insurance recovery is received by any Indemnified
Party with respect to any Losses for which any such Person has been
indemnified and which Losses such Person had received from the Company
Indemnitors hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery (net of costs and expenses incurred in recovering such amounts, and
net of any resulting insurance premiums with respect to insurance policies
other than the RandW Policy) shall be made promptly to the Payment Agent for
distribution to the Company Indemnitors in accordance with their Escrow Pro
Rata Portions, with respect to Losses from the Escrow Fund, and in accordance
with their Indemnity Pro Rata Portions, with respect to Losses in excess of
the Escrow Fund. Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or any
Indemnified Party to seek recovery of Losses under an insurance policy, except
with respect to the RandW Policy as set forth in this Section 8.3(d).

(e)Any Losses for indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined
without duplication of recovery due to the facts giving rise to such Losses
constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement.

8.4 Indemnification Claim Procedures.

(a)Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.1, if an Indemnified
Party wishes to make an indemnification claim under this Article VIII,
including for a Third Party Claim (as defined below) such Indemnified Party
shall deliver a written notice (an "Indemnification Claim Notice") to the
Stockholders' Representative (with a copy to the Escrow Agent, if the Escrow
Period has not expired) (or in the event an Indemnified Party elects to pursue
such indemnification claim directly against an Company Indemnitor, to such
Company Indemnitor directly) (i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid,
incurred, suffered or sustained, or reasonably anticipates that it may pay,
incur, suffer or sustain Losses, and (ii) describing (A) the amount of claimed
Losses in reasonable detail (to the extent known and reasonably quantifiable
by Parent), and (B) the basis for such anticipated liability, and, if
applicable, the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
covenant to which such item is related. Parent may update an Indemnification
Claim Notice from time to time to reflect any change in circumstances
following the date thereof.

(b)If the Stockholders' Representative on behalf of the Company Indemnitors
(or the Company Indemnitor in the event that indemnification is being sought
hereunder directly from such Company Indemnitor) shall not object in writing
within the ten (10) Business Day period after receipt of an Indemnification
Claim Notice by delivery of a written notice of objection containing a
reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances supporting an
objection to the applicable indemnification claim (an "Indemnification Claim
Objection Notice"), such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable
acknowledgment by the Stockholders' Representative on behalf of the Company
Indemnitors (or the applicable Company Indemnitor) that the Indemnified Party
is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such
Indemnification Claim Notice. In such event, Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative shall promptly (but in any event within three (3) Business Days
of the resolution of such Indemnification Claim Notice) deliver a joint
instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to immediately
release to Parent from the Escrow Fund cash with an aggregate value equal to
the Losses set forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice.

 (c)In the event that the Stockholders' Representative shall timely deliver an
Indemnification Claim Objection Notice in accordance with Section 8.4(b), (or
in the event that indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an
Company Indemnitor, if such Company Indemnitor shall object to any claim or
claims made in any Indemnification Claim Notice to recover claims directly
from such Company Indemnitor within ten (10) Business Days after delivery of
such Indemnification Claim Notice), the Stockholders' Representative (or such
objecting Company Indemnitor) and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree
upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims.
If the Stockholders' Representative (or such objecting Company Indemnitor) and
Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be
prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of an indemnification
claim to be recovered from the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any such
memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the
terms thereof. In such event, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release to
Parent from the Escrow Fund cash with an aggregate value equal to the Losses
set forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice. Should the amount held in the
Escrow Fund, if any, be insufficient to satisfy in whole the amount to be paid
to an Indemnified Party in accordance with such memorandum, then, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, each Company Indemnitor shall,
within ten (10) Business Days following the date of such memorandum, pay to
the Indemnified Party, such Company Indemnitor's Indemnity Pro Rata Portion of
such shortfall in cash.

(d)If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior
to sixty (60) days after delivery of an Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice, Parent may file suit with respect to the matter in any court having
jurisdiction. No Losses being disputed under this Section 8.4(d) shall be paid
until a final determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction or is
settled pursuant to a settlement agreement or is agreed to by the
Stockholders' Representative (or objecting Company Indemnitor) in writing (in
each case, a "Final Determination"). Any Losses set forth in such Final
Determination shall be paid by the Company Indemnitors to Parent within three
(3) Business Days after such Final Determination.

8.5 Third Party Claims. In the event Parent becomes aware of a third party
claim (a "Third Party Claim") which Parent reasonably believes may result in a
claim for indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, Parent shall promptly
notify the Stockholders' Representative of such claim with an Indemnification
Claim Notice (a "Third Party Notice"), and shall provide a copy of such Third
Party Notice to the Escrow Agent, if the Escrow Period has not expired and
funds remain in the Escrow Fund, and the Third Party Notice shall be
accompanied by copies of any documentation submitted by the third party making
such Third Party Claim, if any; provided, that no delay or failure on the part
of Parent in delivering a Third Party Notice shall cause Parent to forfeit any
indemnification rights under this Article VIII except to the extent that the
Company Indemnitors are materially prejudiced by such delay or failure. Upon
receipt of a Third Party Notice, the Stockholders' Representative shall be
entitled (on behalf of the Company Indemnitors and at their expense), or, in
the event indemnification is being sought hereunder from fewer than all the
Company Indemnitors, the applicable Company Indemnitors shall be entitled, at
their expense, to participate in, but not to control, determine or conduct,
the defense (including any settlement or compromise) of such Third Party
Claim, with counsel reasonably acceptable to Parent (it being agreed that
Foley and Lardner LLP is reasonably acceptable counsel). Parent shall have the
right in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any
such claim and the Stockholders' Representative (or, in the event
indemnification is being sought hereunder from fewer than all the Company
Indemnitors, such applicable Company Indemnitor) shall not be entitled to
control any negotiation of settlement, adjustment or compromise with respect
to any such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that except with the consent
of the Stockholders' Representative (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld), no settlement of any such Third Party Claim with third party
claimants shall be determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such
matter; provided further, however, that the consent of the Stockholders'
Representative with respect to any settlement of any such Third Party Claim
shall be

 deemed to have been given unless the Stockholders' Representative shall have
objected within twenty (20) days after a written request for such consent by
Parent. In the event that the Stockholders' Representative has consented to
any such settlement, adjustment or compromise, the Company Indemnitors or the
consenting Company Indemnitors, as applicable, shall have no power or
authority to object under any provision of this Article VIII to the amount of
such settlement, adjustment or compromise.

8.6 Legal Representation. Each of the Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that
the Company and the Company Indemnitors have been represented by Foley and
Lardner LLP in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein and that Foley and Lardner LLP has received confidential
information pertaining to the Company in connection with such representation.
The Parent and Merger Sub hereby (i) acknowledge and agree that,
notwithstanding Foley and Lardner LLP's prior representation of the Company and
the Company Indemnitors, and Foley and Lardner LLP's receipt of confidential
information, Foley and Lardner LLP may continue to represent the Company
Indemnitors, or any of them, after the Closing in connection with matters
arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
herein including in connection with any indemnification claim or other
litigation matter arising hereunder which may or may not be adverse to the
Company, and (ii) waive any claim they have or may have that Foley and Lardner
LLP has a conflict of interest or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in
such representation.

8.7 Attorney-Client Privileged Communications. The Parent and the Company each
further agree that, as to all Privileged Deal Communications, the attorney-
client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to the
Company Indemnitors and may be controlled by the Stockholders' Representative
and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Parent, Merger Sub or the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) in the event that a dispute arises between
the Parent, the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates and a third party other than a party to this Agreement after the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation may assert the attorney-client privilege
with respect to Privileged Deal Communications to prevent disclosure of such
confidential communications to such third party; provided, however, that none
of the Surviving Corporation, Merger Sub or Parent may waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of the Stockholders' Representative; and (y)
the Stockholders' Representative shall not waive any such privilege or
disclose any such Privileged Deal Communications other than in connection with
the enforcement or defense of its rights or obligations under this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX 
STOCKHOLDERS' REPRESENTATIVE

9.1 Appointment and Authority of Stockholders' Representative.

(a)By virtue of the execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement, and the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Company
Stockholders, each of the Company Indemnitors shall be deemed to have agreed
to appoint Storm Seller Representative LLC, as his, her or its agent and
attorney-in-fact, as the Stockholders' Representative for and on behalf of the
Company Indemnitors to give and receive notices and communications in respect
of indemnification claims under this Agreement, any Related Agreement or any
of the transactions and other matters contemplated hereby and thereby, to
authorize payment to any Indemnified Party from the Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of any indemnification claims hereunder by any Indemnified Party,
to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to any such indemnification claims, to
assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to, any such indemnification claim by any Indemnified Party hereunder
against any Company Indemnitor or by any such Company Indemnitor against any
Indemnified Party or any dispute between any

 such Indemnified Party and any such Company Indemnitor, in each case relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein, and to take all
other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of
the Stockholders' Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or
(ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be
changed by the Company Indemnitors from time to time upon not less than
fifteen (15) Business Days prior written notice to Parent; provided, however,
that in no case shall the Stockholders' Representative be a Key Employee or
any other current or former Employee of Parent or its Affiliates, and provided
further that the Stockholders' Representative may not be removed unless
holders of a majority interest of the Escrow Fund (based solely on the holders
who are Company Stockholders) agree to such removal and to the identity of the
substituted agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a vacancy in the position of
Stockholders' Representative may be filled by the holders of a majority in
interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Stockholders'
Representative. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholders'
Representative shall constitute notice to or from the Company Indemnitors. For
the avoidance of doubt, in no event may the Stockholders' Representative take
any action which would (x) increase the liabilities or obligations of any
Company Equity Holder beyond what is contemplated by this Agreement or any
Related Agreement or (y) cause any Company Equity Holder to become liable for
any indemnification obligations in excess of the Escrow Fund (other than as
contemplated by Article VIII or any Related Agreement), without the prior
written consent of such Company Equity Holder.

(b)Exculpation and Indemnification of Company Stockholder Representation. The
Stockholders' Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder as Stockholders' Representative while acting in good faith and in
the exercise of reasonable judgment. The Company Indemnitors on whose behalf
the Escrow Amount was contributed to the Escrow Fund shall jointly and
severally indemnify the Stockholders' Representative and hold the
Stockholders' Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense
incurred without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the
Stockholders' Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of the Stockholders' Representative's duties
hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel
retained by the Stockholders' Representative ("Stockholders' Representative
Expenses"). Following the Expiration Date, the resolution of all
indemnification claims made under this Agreement and the satisfaction of all
such indemnification claims, the Stockholders' Representative shall have the
right to recover Stockholders' Representative Expenses from the funds then
remaining in the Escrow Fund, if any, prior to any distribution to the Company
Equity Holders, and prior to any such distribution, shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent a certificate setting forth the Stockholders' Representative
Expenses actually incurred. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholders' Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.3 or Section 10.4, shall constitute a
decision of the Company Indemnitors and shall be final, conclusive and binding
upon the Company Equity Holders; and the Escrow Agent and Parent may rely upon
any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders'
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Company Indemnitors. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any
liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders' Representative.

(c)Expense Cash.

(i)The Expense Cash shall be deposited with the Stockholders' Representative,
to constitute an expense fund (the "Expense Fund") and to be governed by the
provisions set forth herein. The Expense Cash shall be available to reimburse
the Stockholders' Representative for any Stockholders' Representative Expenses
reasonably and actually incurred by the Stockholders' Representative, or to
satisfy any claims against the Company Indemnitors hereunder if the
Stockholders' Representative shall determine there are sufficient funds for
such purpose, and shall be released to the Company Indemnitors and the
Stockholders' Representative, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms of
this Section 9.1. As soon as

 reasonably determined by the Stockholders' Representative that the Expense
Cash is no longer required to be withheld, the Stockholders' Representative
shall deposit the remaining balance of the Expense Cash (if any) with the
Payment Agent for further distribution to the Company Stockholders for the
portion payable in respect of Company Capital Stock and to the Non-Employee
Company Option Holders in respect of Non-Employee Company Options and the
portion of the Expense Cash (if any) payable in respect of Employee Company
Options shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation for further payment to the
holders of such Employee Company Options through the Surviving Corporation's
payroll processing system net of applicable Tax withholding and deductions;
provided, that, if there are any pending but unresolved indemnification claims
of any Indemnified Parties, then all amounts shall remain in escrow and remain
available for release to the Stockholders' Representative until all
indemnification claims have been finally resolved and the Stockholders'
Representative has been reimbursed in full for all Stockholders'
Representative Expenses reasonably and actually incurred and thereafter any
remaining Expense Cash shall be released to the respective Company Indemnitors
(by the Payment Agent or the Surviving Corporation) in proportion to their
respective Escrow Pro Rata Portions. In the event such Stockholders'
Representative Expenses exceed the remaining amount of Expense Cash, the
Stockholders' Representative shall be entitled to recover such expenses
following the expiration of the Escrow Period from the Escrow Amounts
otherwise distributable to or for the benefit of the Company Indemnitors only
at the time of distribution of such amounts (and not distributed or
distributable to an Indemnified Party or subject to a pending indemnification
claim of an Indemnified Party) pursuant to the terms hereof and of the Escrow
Agreement, and such recovery will be made from the Company Indemnitors
according to their respective Indemnity Pro Rata Portions. No provision of
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement shall require the Stockholders'
Representative to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any
financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers,
rights, duties or privileges under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. For
clarity, no Indemnified Party shall have any liability with respect to the
Expense Cash, including with respect to the distribution, investment, holding
and disposition thereof.

(ii)The Stockholders' Representative is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or
liability for any loss of principal of the Expense Cash other than as a result
of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholders'
Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity
in connection with the Expense Cash, and has no tax reporting or income
distribution obligations. The Company Indemnitors will not receive any
interest on the Expense Cash and assign to the Stockholders' Representative
any such interest. The Stockholders' Representative may contribute funds to
the Expense Cash from any consideration otherwise distributable to the Company
Indemnitors.

(iii)For income Tax purposes, the Expense Cash shall be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Company Indemnitors on the Closing
Date, and any Tax withholding required with respect to a Company Stockholder's
deemed receipt of its Escrow Pro Rata Portion of the Expense Cash on the
Closing Date shall be satisfied from such Company Indemnitor's share of Total
Merger Consideration received at Closing pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(i).

(d)The Stockholders' Representative shall be entitled to the reasonable
assistance of the Company's former officers and employees for purposes of
performing its duties and exercising its rights hereunder; provided, that, the
Stockholders' Representative shall treat confidentially and not use or
disclose the terms of this Agreement or any nonpublic information from or
about the Surviving Corporation to anyone (except to the Company Stockholders'
or the Stockholders' Representative's employees, attorneys, accountants,
financial advisors or authorized representatives on a need to know basis, in
each case who agree to treat such information confidentially); provided,
however, that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated
to provide such access or information if it determines, in its reasonable
judgment and after

 consultation with Parent's general counsel or outside legal counsel, that
doing so would jeopardize the protection of attorney-client privilege. The
Stockholders' Representative shall enter into a separate customary
confidentiality agreement prior to being provided access to such information
if requested by Parent.

(e)The powers, immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the
Stockholders' Representative hereunder: (i) are coupled with an interest and
shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Company Indemnitor and shall be binding on any successor
thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Company
Indemnitor of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the
Escrow Funds. The Stockholders' Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely
upon the Closing Spreadsheet, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to
be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper
authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Company Indemnitor or other
party.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
