 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

In consideration of the premises and the mutual representations, warranties,

hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 **THE MERGER**

 



 

Section 1.1 **The Merger**. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 3-105 of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the " **MGCL** ") and
Section 4A-702 and Section 4A-703 of the Maryland Limited Liability Company

3-114 of the MGCL and Section 4A-709 of the MLLCA, and, from and after the
Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), the Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the MGCL and the MLLCA. W. P. Carey will

Section 856 of the Code.

 



 

Section 1.2 **Closing**. The closing (the " **Closing** ") of the Merger will
take place commencing at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by
the parties, which shall be no later than the third Business Day after

those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions), at the offices of
DLA Piper LLP (US), 1251 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10020, or
at such other time and place as is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto
(the date on which the Closing takes place, the " **Closing Date** ").

 



 

Section 1.3 **Effective Time**. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, as part of the Closing CPA17 and Merger Sub shall execute
articles of merger (the " **Articles of Merger** ") in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A and shall file such Articles of Merger in
accordance with the MGCL and the MLLCA with the State Department of
Assessments and Taxation of Maryland (the " **SDAT** ") and shall make all
other filings and recordings required under the MGCL and the MLLCA with
respect to the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as W. P.
Carey and CPA17 shall agree should be specified in the Articles of Merger
(such time as the Merger becomes effective, the " **Effective Time** ");
**provided that** such time is not earlier than the time the Articles of
Merger are filed and accepted

 



      
 

 



 

for record and does not exceed 30 days after the Articles of Merger are
accepted for record. Unless otherwise agreed, the parties shall cause the
Effective Time to occur on the Closing Date.

 



 

Section 1.4 **Articles of Organization and Operating Agreement.** The articles
of organization of Merger Sub (the " **Merger Sub Articles of Organization**
") and the operating agreement of Merger Sub (the " **Merger Sub Operating
Agreement** ") as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger shall, except for any required amendments, be the articles of
organization and the operating agreement of the Surviving Company, until
further amended in accordance with the respective terms of such articles of
organization and operating agreement and applicable Laws of the State of
Maryland.

 



 

Section 1.5 **Officers of the Surviving Company**. Unless otherwise determined
by W. P. Carey and CPA17, from and after the Effective Time, the officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of
the Surviving Company immediately following the Effective Time, in each case
until duly removed or replaced in accordance with the operating agreement of
the Surviving Company and the MGCL and the MLLCA.

 



 

Section 1.6 **Per-Share Merger Consideration**.

 



 

(a) As of the Effective Time, pursuant to this Agreement and by virtue of the
Merger and without any further action on the part of W. P. Carey, CPA17,
Merger Sub, any other W. P. Carey Subsidiary or any stockholder of CPA17 (the
stockholders of CPA17, the " **CPA17 Stockholders** "), each share of common
stock, $0.001 par value per share, of CPA17 (" **CPA17 Common Stock** ")

or the W. P. Carey Bylaws, or the Merger Sub Articles of Organization or the
Merger Sub Operating Agreement, or any provision of the comparable charter or
organizational documents of any of such W. P. Carey Subsidiaries, as

(h) **Compliance with Applicable Laws; Regulatory Matters**. Except for
environmental matters, which are addressed in Section 2.2(n), W. P. Carey and
the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances,
exemptions, orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary for
the lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the " **W. P. Carey
Permits**"), except where the failure so to hold such W. P. Carey Permits,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect. W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey
Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the W. P. Carey Permits,
except where the failure to so comply, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect.
Except as disclosed in the W. P. Carey SEC Documents, the businesses of W. P.
Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of
any Law, except for violations which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect. No
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to W. P. Carey
or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary is pending or, to W. P. Careys Knowledge,
threatened, other than those the outcome of which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey Material
Adverse Effect. Neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey Subsidiary is subject
to any order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation that

Disclosure Letter or the W. P. Carey SEC Documents, there is no suit, action
or proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of W. P. Carey, threatened against
or affecting W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary or any of their
respective properties or assets that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect, nor is
there any such suit, action or proceeding pending against W. P. Carey or any
W. P. Carey Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets which
in any manner challenges or seeks to prevent or enjoin, alter or materially

(j) **Taxes**.

 



 

(i) Each of W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries has timely filed all
material Tax Returns required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any
valid extension to file). Each such Tax Return is true, correct and complete
in all material respects. W. P. Carey and each W. P. Carey Subsidiary has paid
(or W. P. Carey has paid on its behalf) all material Taxes required to be
paid. All material Taxes which W. P. Carey or the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries are
required by Law to withhold or collect, including Taxes required to have been
withheld in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, shareholder or other third party, and sales, gross
receipts and use Taxes, have been duly withheld or collected and, to the
extent required, have been paid over to the proper Governmental Entities
within the time period prescribed by Law. The most recent audited financial
statements contained in the W. P. Carey SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior
to the date of this Agreement reflect an adequate reserve in accordance with
GAAP for all material Taxes payable by W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of
such financial statements. W. P. Carey and each W. P. Carey Subsidiary has
established (and until the Closing Date shall continue to establish and
maintain) on its books and records reserves that are adequate for the payment
of all material Taxes not yet due and payable. Since December 31, 2013,
neither W. P. Carey nor any of the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries has incurred any
material liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business and
other than transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with the sales of
property. No event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists,
which presents a material risk that any material Tax described in the
preceding sentences will be imposed upon W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey
Subsidiary. Except as disclosed in Schedule 2.2(j) of the W. P. Carey
Disclosure Letter, neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey Subsidiary is the
subject of any material audit, examination or other proceeding in respect of
federal, state, local or foreign Taxes; to the Knowledge of W. P. Carey, no
material audit, examination or other proceeding in respect of federal, state,
local or foreign Taxes involving W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary is
being considered by any Tax authority; and no material audit, examination or
proceeding in respect of federal, state, local or foreign Taxes involving W.
P. Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary has occurred since December 31, 2013.
No deficiencies for any Taxes have been asserted or assessed in writing (or,
to the Knowledge of W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey Subsidiary, proposed)
against W. P. Carey or any of the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries, including claims
by any taxing authority in a jurisdiction where W. P. Carey or any W. P. Carey
Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns but in which any of them is or may be
subject to taxation, which individually or in the aggregate would be material,
and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes have been
granted and remain in effect or are pending. There are no Liens for Taxes upon
the assets of W. P. Carey or the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries except for statutory

 



      
 

 



 

Liens for Taxes not yet due or payable and for which appropriate reserves have
been established on their respective financial statements in accordance with
GAAP.

of the Code and has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT
beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2012, (B) has operated, and
intends to continue to operate, in a manner consistent with the requirements
for qualification and taxation as a REIT through the Effective Time and (C)
has not taken or omitted to take any action which could reasonably be expected
to result in the failure to qualify or continue to qualify as a REIT. Each
Subsidiary of W. P. Carey which is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company has, during the taxable year of W. P. Carey ended December
31, 2012 and at all times thereafter, (A) been classified for federal income
Tax purposes as a partnership or treated as a disregarded entity and not as an
association taxable as a corporation, or a "publicly traded partnership"
within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code, and (B) not owned any
assets (including, without limitation, securities) that would cause W. P.
Carey to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. During the taxable year of W.
P. Carey ended December 31, 2012 and at all times thereafter, each W. P. Carey
Subsidiary which is a corporation, and each other issuer of securities in
which W. P. Carey holds securities (within the meaning of Section 856(c) of
the Code but excluding "straight debt" of issuers as described in Section
856(m) of the Code) having a value of more than 10 percent of the total value,
or more than 10 percent of the total voting power, of the outstanding
securities of such issuer has been a REIT, a qualified REIT subsidiary under
Section 856(i) of the Code or a taxable REIT subsidiary under Section 856(l)
of the Code. Neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey Subsidiary holds any
asset (x) the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to
Section 1374 of the Code as announced in IRS Notice 88-19 or Treasury
Regulation Section 1.337(d)-5, Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-6 or
Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-7 or (y) that is subject to a consent

allocation or sharing agreement or has changed any method of accounting for
Tax purposes.

 



 

(v) W. P. Carey does not have any liability for the Taxes of any person other
than W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries, and the W. P. Carey
Subsidiaries do not have any liability for the Taxes of any person other than
W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries, (A) under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law),
(B) as a transferee or successor, (C) by contract or (D) otherwise.

 



 

(vi) Neither W. P. Carey nor any W. P. Carey Subsidiary (x) has requested,
received or is subject to any written ruling of a Governmental Entity related
to Taxes or has entered into any written and legally binding agreement with a
Governmental Entity relating to Taxes, (y) has engaged in any transaction of
which it has made (or was required to make) disclosure to any Governmental
Entity to avoid the imposition of any penalties related to

 



      
 

 



 

Taxes, or (z) has participated in any transaction that could give rise to a
disclosure obligation as a "listed transaction" under Section 6011 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder or any similar provision under
applicable Law.

 



 

(k) **Pension and Benefit Plans and Employee Relations**. Schedule 2.2(k) of
the W. P. Carey Disclosure Letter lists each written material "employee
pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" **ERISA** ")) (referred to herein
as " **Pension Plans** ") or "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA), other than as set forth in the W. P. Carey SEC
Documents, providing benefits to any current employee, officer or director of
W. P. Carey or any of the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries or any entity that is or
required under Section 414 of the Code to be treated with W. P. Carey as a
single employer (an " **ERISA Affiliate** ") or with respect to which W. P.
Carey or any ERISA Affiliate could have any liability that would reasonably be
expected to have a W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect (collectively, the "
**Benefit Plans** "). Each Benefit Plan has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and the applicable requirements of
ERISA, the Code and all other applicable Laws. Each Pension Plan intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has been the subject of a
determination letter from the IRS to the effect that such Pension Plan is so
qualified under all currently applicable provisions of Section 401(a) of the
Code and, to the Knowledge of W. P. Carey, no circumstances exist that would
adversely affect the qualification of any such Pension Plan. No Benefit Plan
is subject to Title IV of ERISA. Each Benefit Plan may be amended or
terminated in accordance with its terms. Schedule 2.2(k) of the W. P. Carey
Disclosure Letter lists each material employment, severance, consulting or
other contract or plan with or for the benefit of any officer, director or
employee of W. P. Carey or any of the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries containing a
"change of control" provision that provides for any material payment,
additional benefits, vesting or acceleration of benefits or rights or
otherwise upon the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(l) **Information Supplied**. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by W. P. Carey or Merger Sub in writing for inclusion or

Sub, their respective officers and directors, and the W. P. Carey
Subsidiaries) comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; **provided that** no
representation is made as to statements made or incorporated

businesses of each of W. P. Carey and the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " **W. P. Carey Intangible Property**"), except where the
failure to possess or have adequate rights to use such properties,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
W. P. Carey Material Adverse Effect. All of the W. P. Carey Intangible
Property is owned or licensed by W. P. Carey or the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries
free and clear of any and all Liens, except those that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a W. P. Carey Material

the Knowledge of W. P. Carey, the use of W. P. Carey Intangible Property by W.
P. Carey or the W. P. Carey Subsidiaries does not, in any material respect,
conflict with, infringe upon, violate or interfere with or constitute an
appropriation of any right, title, interest or goodwill, including, without

proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the Merger, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents,
including seeking to have any stay, temporary restraining order, injunction,
or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the

(b) Each of CPA17, W. P. Carey and Merger Sub shall give prompt notice to each
other party if (i) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becomes untrue or inaccurate in
any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not so qualified
becomes untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii) it fails to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement;
**provided that** the delivery of any notice pursuant to Section 4.2(a) shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice; and **provided** , **further** , **that** failure to
give such notice shall not be treated as a breach of covenant for the purposes
of Sections 5.2(b) or 5.3(b), as the case may be.

 



 

Section 4.3 **Fees and Distributions Payable to W. P. Carey and its
Affiliates**.

 



 

(a) In connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby (and not any CPA17 Competing Transaction), and conditioned upon the
closing of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, W. P.
Carey hereby waives, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, all rights to
receive any and all Advisor Closing Amounts to which W. P. Carey and any of
its Affiliates may be entitled in connection with the closing of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, the parties agree
that no Subordinated Disposition Fees shall be payable by CPA17 to W. P. Carey
and its Affiliates in respect of the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) The parties agree that the waiver of Advisor Closing Amounts set forth in
Section 4.3(a) is conditioned on the closing of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and in the event that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated and this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with Section 6.1, subject to the CPA17 Termination
Fee Credit described in the following sentence, none of W. P. Carey or any of
its Affiliates hereby waives any Advisor Closing Amounts or Subordinated
Disposition Fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with either Section 6.1(g) or Section 6.1(h), (ii) a
CPA17 Termination Fee is actually paid in accordance with Section 6.2(d), and
(iii) the Advisor Closing Amounts become payable as a result thereof, then (I)
an amount equal to the CPA17 Termination Fee Credit shall be credited against
the Advisor Closing Amounts payable to W. P. Carey and its Affiliates and (II)
no Subordinated Disposition Fees shall be payable to W. P. Carey and its
Affiliates in respect of the consummation of any CPA17 Competing Transaction
that would otherwise result in the payment of any Subordinated Disposition
Fees. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, in the CPA LP Agreement or
otherwise, the CPA17 Termination Fee Credit shall be the only credit against
the Advisory Closing Amounts, and the CPA17 Termination Fee Credit provided
for in this Section 4.3(b) supersedes, and is in lieu of, any credit provided
in Section 11.7 of the CPA LP Agreement.

 



 

(c) Concurrently with and conditioned upon the closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any CPA17 Competing Transaction (and
provided that CPA17 has paid W. P. Carey and its Affiliates the CPA17
Termination Fee and the Advisory Closing Amounts to the extent required under
this Agreement), the Amended and Restated Advisory Agreement dated as of
January 1, 2015, among CPA17, CPA17 LP and CAM (as amended, the " **CPA17
Advisory Agreement** "), and the Amended and Restated Asset

 



      
 

 



 

Management Agreement dated as of May 13, 2015, among CPA17, CPA17 LP and
Foreign Subsidiary (as amended, the " **Asset Management Agreement** " and
together with the CPA17 Advisory Agreement, the " **CPA17 Advisory
Agreements** "), shall automatically terminate without any action by any of
the parties thereto and without any requirement for prior notice. In addition,
if (i) this Agreement is terminated in accordance with either Section 6.1(g)
or Section 6.1(h) and (ii) a CPA17 Competing Transaction is consummated, then
the Call Right (as such term is defined in the Amended and Restated Agreement
of Limited Partnership of CPA17 LP dated as of January 1, 2015, by and between
CPA17 and Special General Partner (the " **CPA17 LP Agreement** "), shall be
deemed exercised by CPA17 LP and the payment of the Special GP Amount (after
giving effect to the CPA17 Termination Fee Credit), shall be deemed to satisfy
in full all amounts owed and payable to W. P. Carey and its Affiliates at the
closing of the CPA17 Competing Transaction pursuant to Section 11.7 of the
CPA17 LP Agreement.

 



 

(d) The parties agree that W. P. Carey and its Affiliates shall continue to be
entitled to receive any and all fees and distributions accrued, pursuant to
the CPA17 Advisory Agreements and the CPA17 LP Agreement (collectively, the "
**Advisor Accrued Amounts** "), prior to the closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any CPA17 Competing Transaction. Advisor
Accrued Amounts shall not include Advisor Closing Amounts or Subordinated
Disposition Fees that the parties have agreed in Sections 4.3(b) or (c) shall
not be payable thereunder.

 



 

(e) Each of CAM, Foreign Subsidiary, Merger Sub and the Special General
Partner agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 4.3.

 



 

Section 4.4 **Tax Treatment; Cooperation**.

 



 

(a) CPA17 shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be
filed, on a timely basis all Tax Returns and amendments thereto required to be
filed prior to the Closing Date (after electing all available automatic
extensions of time to file such Tax Returns) by CPA17 or any of the CPA17
Subsidiaries, in a manner consistent with past practice (unless an alternative
manner is required to avoid imposition of any penalties, fines or additions to
Tax). Prior to filing any such Tax Returns, CPA17 shall deliver draft copies
(together with supporting documentation, including Tax Return work papers) to
W. P. Carey for W. P. Careys review and comment, and CPA17 shall accept all
reasonable comments of W. P. Carey with respect to such Tax Returns. CPA17
shall pay all Taxes required to be paid by CPA17 prior to the Effective Time.
W. P. Carey shall have a reasonable period of time (but in no event less than
30 days) to review and comment on such Tax Returns and amendments prior to
filing. If the parties do not agree on the draft Tax Returns or amendments,
the parties shall hire a nationally recognized accounting firm reasonably
acceptable to CPA17 and W. P. Carey to prepare the contested Tax Returns or
amendments.

 



 

(b) CPA17 will take all necessary actions, including but not limited to making
sufficient distributions prior to Closing if needed, to assure that CPA17 will
qualify as a REIT for its Tax year ending on the Closing Date. During the
period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, CPA17 shall, and
shall cause each CPA17 Subsidiary to, facilitate all reasonable requests of W.
P. Carey with respect to the maintenance of CPA17s REIT qualification.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Merger Sub, W. P. Carey and CPA17 shall report the Merger for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and all relevant state and local income tax purposes as a
reorganization governed by Section 368(a)(1) of the Code, unless otherwise
required by Law or administrative action, and shall comply with any applicable
Tax reporting requirements.

 



 

(d) The parties agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts in order to
structure the transactions contemplated by the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, as mutually agreed by the parties, in a manner so as to
reduce transfer taxes and other governmental charges related to the matters
described therein.

 



 

Section 4.5 **Solicitation of Transactions**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
during the period beginning upon the first Business Day after the date hereof
and continuing until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the 30th day
thereafter (the " **Solicitation Period End Date** "), CPA17, acting directly
or indirectly through any of its officers, directors, investment advisors,
agents, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
brokers, finders, representatives or controlled Affiliates of CPA17 or any
CPA17 Subsidiary shall have the right to directly or indirectly (i) initiate,
solicit, induce, cause, encourage and facilitate any CPA17 Competing
Transaction, including by way of providing access to the properties, offices,
assets, books, records and personnel of CPA17 and any CPA17 Subsidiary and
furnishing non-public information pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or
more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements; **provided, however** , that any
such non-public information shall, to the extent not previously provided to W.
P. Carey, Merger Sub or their respective representatives, be provided to W. P.
Carey or Merger Sub prior to or substantially concurrently with it being
provided to any Person given such access, (ii) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with respect to any
CPA17 Competing Transaction, or any inquiry, proposal or offer that
constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to a CPA17 Competing
Transaction or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or
facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations
or the making of any CPA17 Competing Transaction and (iii) grant a waiver
under any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by
CPA17 to the extent necessary to allow the other party thereto to submit any
CPA17 Competing Transaction or inquire, propose or make an offer that may lead
to a CPA17 Competing Transaction to the CPA17 Special Committee in compliance
with this Section 4.5. W. P. Carey agrees that neither it nor any Affiliate of
W. P. Carey shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its and their respective representatives not to, participate in discussions
with (other than at the request of the CPA17 Special Committee), any person
that it knows has made, or is considering or participating in discussions or
negotiations with CPA17 or its representatives regarding, a CPA17 Competing
Transaction: **provided** , **however** , that nothing in this sentence shall
prohibit or restrict W. P. Carey from making or conducting public
communications or solicitations regarding a CPA17 Competing Transaction or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Except (i) as expressly permitted by this Section 4.5, or (ii) with
respect to any Exempted Person until receipt of the CPA17 Stockholder
Approval, from the Solicitation Period End Date until the Effective Time or,
if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.1,
CPA17, acting directly or indirectly through any of its officers,

 



      
 

 



 

directors, investment advisors, agents, investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants, brokers, finders, representatives or
controlled Affiliates of CPA17 or any CPA17 Subsidiary, shall cease and cause
to be terminated any solicitation, discussion or negotiation with any Persons
with respect to any CPA17 Competing Transaction and request the immediate
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished.
Except as specifically provided in this Section 4.5, from the Solicitation
Period End Date until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.1, CPA17, acting directly or
indirectly through any of its officers, directors, investment advisors,
agents, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
brokers, finders or representatives, or any controlled Affiliates of CPA17 or
any CPA17 Subsidiary, shall not (i) initiate, solicit, propose, cause
(including by providing information) or take any action designed to, or which
would reasonably be expected to, facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, a CPA17 Competing Transaction, other than with respect to any Exempted
Person, (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or provide any information or data concerning,
CPA17 or any CPA17 Subsidiary, including their properties, books and records,
to any Person (other than with respect to any Exempted Person) relating to, or
otherwise cooperate with, any CPA17 Competing Transaction or any proposal or
offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to a CPA17 Competing
Transaction, (iii) approve, publicly endorse, publicly recommend or enter into
any CPA17 Competing Transaction or any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger

similar agreement with respect to any CPA17 Competing Transaction (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this
Section 4.5) (an " **Alternative Acquisition Agreement** "), (iv) publicly
propose, agree or publicly announce an intention to take any of the foregoing
actions, (v) take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover Statute
inapplicable to any transaction contemplated by a CPA17 Competing Transaction,

Stockholder Approval, or (vi) except to the extent waived pursuant to Section
4.5(a)(iii) above and with respect to any Exempted Person until receipt of the
CPA17 Stockholder Approval, terminate, amend, release, modify or fail to
enforce any provision of, or grant any permission, waiver or request under,
any standstill, confidentiality or similar agreement entered into by CPA17 in
respect of or in contemplation of a CPA17 Competing Transaction. The foregoing
will not prevent CPA17 from, after the end of the Solicitation Period End
Date, (x) communicating with a prospective acquirer to request clarification
of the terms and conditions of a possible CPA17 Competing Transaction so as to
determine whether such CPA17 Competing Transaction could reasonably be
expected to lead to a CPA17 Superior Competing Transaction or (y) providing
non-public information about CPA17 or any CPA17 Subsidiary (subject to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) to, and engaging in discussions and
negotiations regarding a possible CPA17 Competing Transaction with, a
prospective acquirer in response to a proposal or offer that could reasonably
be expected to lead to a CPA17 Competing Transaction, in either instance,
which CPA17 received prior to the Solicitation Period End Date, or which CPA17
receives after the Solicitation Period End Date that did not result in whole
or in part from a breach of this Section 4.5(b), and which the CPA17 Special
Committee determines in good faith after consultation with its independent
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, would result (if consummated in
accordance with its terms) in, or is reasonably likely to result in, a CPA17
Superior Competing Transaction.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Except as expressly provided by Section 4.5(d), at any time after the date
hereof, the CPA17 Special Committee shall not (i) (A) publicly withhold or
withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to W. P. Carey or Merger
Sub), or publicly propose to withhold or withdraw (or qualify or modify in a
manner adverse to W. P. Carey or Merger Sub), its recommendation of this
Agreement and the Merger or otherwise publicly repudiate the adoption,
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the CPA17 Special
Committee of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (B) adopt, approve, publicly declare advisable or recommend or
publicly propose to adopt, approve, declare advisable or recommend any CPA17
Competing Transaction, (C) allow its recommendation of this Agreement and the
Merger to be excluded from the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (D) fail to
recommend against any CPA17 Competing Transaction within ten (10) Business
Days after such CPA17 Competing Transaction is publicly announced, or (E) if a
tender or exchange offer relating to equity securities of CPA17 is commenced
by a Person unaffiliated with W. P. Carey, fail to send to the CPA17
Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Securities Act,
within ten (10) Business Days after such tender or exchange offer is first
published, a statement disclosing that the CPA17 Special Committee recommends
rejection of such tender or exchange offer (any action described in clauses
(A), (B), (C), (D) or (E), an " **Adverse Recommendation Change** "), or (ii)
adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or cause or permit CPA17 or any CPA17
Subsidiary to execute or enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance
with this Section 4.5).

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to receipt of the CPA17 Stockholder Approvals, the CPA17
Special Committee shall be permitted to either (i) terminate this Agreement in
order to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a
CPA17 Superior Competing Transaction, subject to compliance with Section
6.1(g) and Section 6.2, or (ii) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, in
each instance, if and only if (A) the CPA17 Special Committee has received a
CPA17 Competing Transaction (whether or not from an Exempted Person) that, in
the good faith determination of the CPA17 Special Committee, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes
a CPA17 Superior Competing Transaction, after having complied with this
Section 4.5(d), and (B) with respect to any Person who is not an Exempted
Person, the CPA17 Special Committee determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that a failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the duties of the members of the CPA17 Special
Committee under applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to either
terminating this Agreement or effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change, in
each instance in accordance with this Section 4.5(d), (x) the CPA17 Special
Committee shall provide a written notice to W. P. Carey and Merger Sub that it
intends to take such action and describing (1) the basis for its
determination, and (2) the material terms and conditions of the CPA17 Superior
Competing Transaction that is the basis of such action (including the identity
of the party making the CPA17 Superior Competing Transaction and any financing
commitments related thereto, which shall include any fee letters, which
letters may be redacted to omit the numerical amounts provided therein, as
applicable) (a " **Change of Recommendation Notice** "); (y) during the three
(3) Business Day period following W. P. Careys and Merger Subs receipt of
the Change of Recommendation Notice, CPA17 shall, and shall cause its
officers, directors, investment advisors, agents, investment bankers,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, brokers, finders or
representatives, or any controlled Affiliates

 



      
 

 



 

of CPA17 or any CPA17 Subsidiary to, negotiate with W. P. Carey and Merger Sub
in good faith (to the extent that W. P. Carey and Merger Sub desire to
negotiate) to make amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so
as to obviate the need for the proposed termination of this Agreement or the
proposed Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable; and (z) following the
close of business on the last day of the three (3) Business Day period or such
greater period of time as may be permitted by the CPA17 Special Committee in
its sole discretion, the CPA17 Special Committee shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, and taking into account any amendments to this Agreement proposed in
writing by W. P. Carey and Merger Sub in response to the Change of
Recommendation Notice, that such CPA17 Competing Transaction continues to
constitute a CPA17 Superior Competing Transaction (whether or not from an
Exempted Person), and with respect to any Person who is not an Exempted Person
a failure to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent
with the duties of the members of the CPA17 Special Committee under applicable
Law. If any amendment to the financial terms or any material term of any CPA17
Superior Competing Transaction is made, the CPA17 Special Committee shall
deliver a new Change of Recommendation Notice to W. P. Carey and Merger Sub,
and CPA17 shall be required to comply again with the requirements of this
Section 4.5(d); **provided that** with respect to any and all such new Change
of Recommendation Notices, the references in this Section 4.5(d) to "three (3)
Business Days" shall be deemed to be references to "one (1) Business Day".

 



 

(e) Within forty-eight (48) hours after the expiration of the Solicitation
Period End Date, CPA17 shall (i) notify W. P. Carey in writing of the identity
of each person, if any, that, in accordance with this Agreement, the CPA17
Special Committee has determined to be an Exempted Person and (ii) provide W.
P. Carey with the material terms and conditions of any CPA17 Competing
Transaction received from any Exempted Person prior to the Solicitation Period
End Date. CPA17 shall keep W. P. Carey reasonably and promptly informed of any
material changes in the status, terms or conditions of any CPA17 Competing
Transaction received from any Exempted Person. Except as may relate to an
Exempted Person, from and after the Solicitation Period End Date, CPA17 shall
(i) as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within forty-eight
(48) hours of receipt), advise W. P. Carey of receipt by CPA17 or any of its
Affiliates of (A) any CPA17 Competing Transaction or (B) any request for
information that would reasonably be expected to lead to any CPA17 Competing
Transaction, the terms and conditions of any such CPA17 Competing Transaction
or request (including the identity of the party making such CPA17 Competing
Transaction), (ii) keep W. P. Carey fully and promptly informed (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours) of any material changes in the status,
terms or conditions of any such CPA17 Competing Transaction (it being
understood that any change or modification to any financial term or condition
of any CPA17 Competing Transaction shall be deemed to be a material change) or
request, and (iii) provide W. P. Carey promptly with (a) an unredacted copy of
any such CPA17 Competing Transactions made in writing (including any financing
commitments relating thereto, which shall include any fee letters (it being
understood that any such fee letter may be redacted to omit the numerical
amounts provided therein)) and (b) a written summary of the material terms of
any CPA17 Competing Transactions not made in writing (including any financing
commitments and any fee letters relating thereto (it being understood that any
such fee letter may be redacted to omit the numerical amounts provided
therein)).

 



      
 

 



 

(f) So long as this Agreement has not been terminated, no Adverse
Recommendation Change shall change the approval of the CPA17 Special Committee
for purposes of causing any Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(g) Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 4.5 by CPA17, acting directly or
indirectly through any of its officers, directors, investment advisors,
agents, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
brokers, finders or other agents or representatives, or any controlled
Affiliates of CPA17 or any CPA17 Subsidiary, shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Section 4.5 by CPA17.

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, a " **CPA17 Competing Transaction** "
shall mean any proposal or offer for, whether in one transaction or a series
of transactions, any of the following (other than the transactions expressly
provided for in this Agreement): (i) any merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving CPA17 (or any
of the material CPA17 Subsidiaries); (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage,
pledge, transfer or other disposition of 50% or more of the assets of CPA17
and the CPA17 Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, excluding any bona fide
financing transactions which do not, individually or in the aggregate, have as
a purpose or effect the sale or transfer of control of such assets; (iii) any
issue, sale or other disposition of (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination or similar transaction)
securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or securities
convertible into, such securities) representing fifty percent (50%) or more of

period of six years from the Effective Time all rights to indemnification

transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, all
attorneys, accountants and investment bankers fees and expenses and fees
and expenses of the CPA17 Special Committee).

 



 

(d) CPA17 agrees that if this Agreement shall be terminated either by (i)
CPA17 pursuant to Section 6.1(g), or (ii) W. P. Carey pursuant to Section
6.1(h), in each instance, CPA17 shall pay the CPA17 Termination Fee to W. P.
Carey prior to or concurrently with such termination, by wire transfer of same
day funds to one or more accounts designated by W. P. Carey.

 



 

(e) The foregoing provisions of this Section 6.2 have been agreed to by CPA17

by this Agreement, it being agreed and acknowledged by each of them that the
execution of this Agreement by them constitutes full and reasonable
consideration for such provisions.

 



 

(f) In the event that either W. P. Carey or CPA17 is required to file suit to
seek all or a portion of the amounts payable under this Section 6.2, and such
party prevails in

 



      
 

 



 

such litigation, such party shall be entitled to reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable outside attorneys fees and
expenses, which it has incurred in enforcing its rights under this Section
6.2.

 



 

Section 6.3 **Effect of Termination**. In the event of termination of this

liability or obligation on the part of W. P. Carey, Merger Sub or CPA17, other
than Section 6.2, this Section 6.3, Section 6.6 and Article VII and except to
the extent that such termination results from a willful breach by a party of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement or a failure or refusal by such party to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby when such party was obligated to do so in
accordance with the terms hereof.

 



 

Section 6.4 **Amendment**. This Agreement may be amended by the parties in
writing by action of their respective Boards of Directors at any time before
or after the CPA17 Stockholder Approvals are obtained and prior to the filing

after the CPA17 Stockholder Approvals are obtained, no such amendment,
modification or supplement shall alter the amount of the Per Share Merger
Consideration to be delivered to the CPA17 Stockholders or alter or change any
of the terms or conditions of this Agreement if such alteration or change
would adversely affect the CPA17 Stockholders.

 



 

Section 6.5 **Extension; Waiver**. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
each of CPA17 and W. P. Carey may (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement or (c) subject to the provisions of Section 6.4, waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions of the other party contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of those rights.

 



 

Section 6.6 **Payment of Expenses**.

 



 

(a) In the event that CPA17 or W. P. Carey becomes obligated to pay any
expenses under Section 6.2 (the " **Expense Amount** "), CPA17 or W. P. Carey,
as applicable, shall pay to the party entitled to receive such payment (the "
**Receiving Party** ") from the amount deposited into escrow in accordance
with this Section 6.6(a), an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the Expense
Amount and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to the
Receiving Party without causing the Receiving Party to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Code for the year in
which the Expense Amount would otherwise be payable, for this purpose treating
such amount as income that does not qualify for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (c)(3) of the Code, as determined by the Receiving Partys independent
certified public accountants, plus (B) if the Receiving Party receives either
(1) a letter from the Receiving Partys counsel indicating that the Receiving
Party has received a ruling from the IRS described in Section 6.6(b) or (2) an
opinion from the Receiving Partys counsel as described in Section 6.6(b), an
amount equal to the Expense Amount less the amount payable

 



      
 

 



 

under clause (A) above. To the extent the entire Expense Amount is not paid to
the Receiving Party in the year in which such amount would otherwise be
payable as a result of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.6(a), the
Expense Amount shall be carried forward to the succeeding year and shall be
payable (as described above) in such succeeding year by applying the same
formula and by deeming such Expense Amount as payable in such succeeding year.
To the extent the full Expense Amount has not been paid in the initial and
succeeding year, the amount shall similarly be carried forward for each of the
next three taxable years. To the extent that the entire Expense Amount has not
been paid in the initial year, the succeeding year and the three following
years, the Expense Amount shall be forfeited by the Receiving Party. To secure
the obligation of CPA17 or W. P. Carey, as applicable, to pay these amounts,
CPA17 or W. P. Carey, as applicable, shall deposit into escrow an amount in
cash equal to the Expense Amount with an escrow agent selected by CPA17 or W.
P. Carey, as applicable, and on such terms (subject to Section 6.6(b)) as
shall be mutually agreed upon by CPA17 or W. P. Carey, as applicable, the
Receiving Party and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into escrow of
the Expense Amount pursuant to this Section 6.6(a) shall be made at the time
CPA17 or W. P. Carey, as applicable, would otherwise be obligated to pay the
Receiving Party pursuant to Section 6.2.

 



 

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Expense Amount in escrow or
any portion thereof shall not be released to the Receiving Party unless the
escrow agent receives any of the following: (i) a letter from the Receiving
Partys independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount
that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Receiving Party without causing
the payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of
the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income
that qualifies for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Code ("
**Qualifying Income** ") or a subsequent letter from the Receiving Partys
accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release
such amount to the Receiving Party, or (ii) a letter from the Receiving
Partys counsel indicating that the Receiving Party received a ruling from the
IRS holding that the receipt by the Receiving Party of the Expense Amount
would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income for purposes of Code Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) (or alternatively, the
Receiving Partys counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the
receipt by the Receiving Party of the Expense Amount would either constitute
Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income for purposes of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Code), in which case the escrow agent
shall release the remainder of the Expense Amount to the Receiving Party.
CPA17 and W. P. Carey each agree to amend this Section 6.6 at the request of
the Receiving Party in order to (A) maximize the portion of the Expense Amount
that may be distributed to the Receiving Party hereunder without causing the
Receiving Party to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and
(c)(3) of the Code, (B) improve the likelihood of the Receiving Party securing
a ruling described in this Section 6.6(b), or (C) assist the Receiving Party
in obtaining a legal opinion from its counsel as described in this Section
6.6(b). The escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion of the
Expense Amount not paid to the Receiving Party in the initial year and the
four succeeding years shall be released by the escrow agent to CPA17 or W. P.
Carey, as applicable. Unless such party is the Receiving Party, none of CPA17
or W. P. Carey shall be a party to such escrow agreement and neither shall
bear any cost of or have liability resulting from the escrow agreement.
