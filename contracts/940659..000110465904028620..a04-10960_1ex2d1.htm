 ** _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_**

  



  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of September 23, 2004 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is among St. Jude Medical, Inc., a Minnesota corporation ("
_Buyer_ "), Dragon Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Buyer (" _Sub_ "), and Endocardial Solutions, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ ") (Sub and the Company being hereinafter
collectively referred to as the " _Constituent Corporations_ ").

  



  

# **RECITALS:**

  

# ** **

  

A. The respective Boards of Directors of Buyer, Sub and the Company have
approved and declared advisable the merger of Sub with and into the Company
upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement (the "
_Merger_ "), and the respective Boards of Directors of Buyer, Sub and the
Company have approved and adopted this Agreement;

  



  

B. The respective Boards of Directors of Buyer and the Company have
determined that the Merger is in the best interest of their respective
stockholders; and

  



  

C. The Company is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of
Delaware and has authorized 40,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par
value per share (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), of which 22,143,300 shares
are outstanding and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per
share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "), of which no shares are outstanding
(the Company Common Stock and the Company Preferred Stock are collectively
referred to as the " _Company Capital Stock_ ").

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations, warranties
and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

  



  

# **ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER**

  

# ** **

  

 **Section 1.1** ** _The Merger_.** Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions hereof, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation
Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2). Following the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and
shall succeed to and assume all the rights and obligations of Sub
in accordance with the DGCL.

  



  

 **Section 1.2** ** _Effective Time_.** Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date: (a) the Certificate of
Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") substantially in the form of
_Exhibit A_ shall be duly executed by the Company and Sub and thereafter
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and (b) the
parties shall make such other filings with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware as shall be necessary to effect the Merger.  The Merger
shall become effective at such time as a properly executed Certificate of
Merger is duly filed

  

      
   



  

with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as
Buyer and the Company may agree upon and as may be set forth in the
Certificate of Merger. The time the Merger becomes effective is referred to
herein as the " _Effective Time_ ".

  



  

 **Section 1.3** ** _Effects of the Merger_. ** The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in this Agreement and Section 259 of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all properties, rights privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

 **Section 1.4** ** _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws; Directors and
Officers_. **(a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation in effect at the Effective Time will be amended in its entirety
at the Effective Time to read as set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto and shall
be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by Applicable Law. The
By-laws of Sub in effect at the Effective Time will be the By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
or by Applicable Law.

  



  

(b) The directors of Sub at the Effective Time shall automatically, and
without further action, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The officers
of the Sub at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  



  

 **Section 1.5** ** _Conversion of Securities_. **As of the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Sub,
the Company or the holders of any capital stock of the Constituent
Corporations:

  



  

(a) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of Sub shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
outstanding immediately after the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) All shares of Company Capital Stock that are held in the treasury of the
Company and any shares of Company Capital Stock owned by Buyer or Sub or any
other Subsidiary of Buyer, direct or indirect, shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no capital stock of Buyer
or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) At the Effective Time, each then issued and outstanding share of Company
Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares and shares described in Section
1.5(b)) shall immediately cease to be outstanding, shall automatically be

  



  

2      
   



  

cancelled and retired, shall cease to exist, and shall be converted into the
right to receive $11.75 (the " _Per Share Price_ ") to be distributed in
accordance with this Section 1.5(c), 1.6, and 1.7. At the Effective Time,
each holder of Company Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such issued and outstanding shares (other than Dissenting Shares)
of Company Capital Stock (including, without limitation, the right to vote),
except for the right to receive the Per Share Price. Unless the context
otherwise requires, each reference in this Agreement to shares of Company
Common Stock shall include the associated Company Rights.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, then the Per Share Price shall be correspondingly
adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares.

  



  

(d) All outstanding options exercisable into shares of Company Common Stock,
but unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time will be treated as
set forth in Section 5.5 hereof.

  



  

 **Section 1.6** ** _Payment of Per Share Price_. **(a) Buyer shall appoint
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., or other commercial bank or trust company as a paying
agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the benefit of the holders of Company
Common Stock that are not Dissenting Shares and who are entitled to receive
the Per Share Price (collectively, the " _Holders_ "). At or immediately
prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall make available to the Paying Agent
an amount of cash sufficient to permit payment of the Per Share Price to the
Holders (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall exchange the shares
of Company Common Stock for the Per Share Price in accordance with the terms
of this Article I, through such reasonable procedures as the Paying Agent
or Buyer may adopt.

  



  

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Buyer or the Paying
Agent shall cause to be mailed to each record holder of a certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Company
Common Stock converted in the Merger (the " _Certificates_ ") a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of
the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall contain instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and payment of the Per
Share Price). Upon surrender for cancellation to the Paying Agent of a
Certificate held by any Holder, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the Holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor that amount of cash equal to the Per Share Price for each
share of Company Common Stock represented by the Certificate. Any Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amounts shall be payable at the
Effective Time with respect to any Dissenting Shares or any shares of Company
Capital Stock with respect to which dissenters rights have not terminated.
 In the case of Dissenting Shares, payment shall be made in accordance with
Section 1.12

  



  

3      
   



  

and the DGCL. In the case of any shares of Company Capital Stock with respect
to which dissenters rights have not terminated as of the Effective Time, if
such shares of Company Capital Stock become Dissenting Shares, payment shall
be made in accordance with Section 1.12 and the DGCL, and if, instead, the
dissenters rights with respect to such shares irrevocably terminate after
the Effective Time, such shares of Company Capital Stock shall be entitled to
receive the Per Share Price in accordance with the provisions of this Section
1.6.

  



  

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former
Holders for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Buyer,
upon demand of Buyer, and any former Holders who have not theretofore
complied with this Article I shall thereafter look only to Buyer for payment
of the Per Share Price. Neither Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any holder of Shares for cash delivered to a public official in
connection herewith pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

  



  

 **Section 1.7** ** _Transfer Taxes; Withholding_. **If any cash is to be
paid to or issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Buyer or the Paying Agent
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of cash in a
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered,
or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Buyer or the Paying Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Buyer or the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock
such amounts as Buyer or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or under
any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.  To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Buyer or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of the shares of Company Capital Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Buyer or the Paying Agent and
transmitted by Buyer or the Paying Agent to the appropriate taxing authority
with attribution to each specific Holder.

  



  

 **Section 1.8** ** _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.
**All amounts paid to Holders upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Capital Stock
represented by such Certificates.

  



  

 **Section 1.9** ** _Closing of Company Transfer Books_. **At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer
of shares of Company Capital Stock shall thereafter be made on the records of
the Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, such Certificates shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article I.

  



  

4      
   



  

 **Section 1.10** ** _Lost Certificates_. **If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Buyer or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Buyer may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against them with respect to such Certificate, Buyer
will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
amounts to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 1.5.

  



  

 **Section 1.11** ** _Further Assurances_. **If at any time after the
Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised
that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or
things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of
record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises,
properties or assets of either of the Constituent Corporations, or (b)
otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving
Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their designees shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either of the
Constituent Corporations, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and
assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of either Constituent
Corporation, all such other acts and things as may be necessary, desirable or
proper to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving Corporations right, title
or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers,

 **Section 1.12** ** _Dissenters  Rights_. **(a) Shares of Company Capital
Stock that have not been voted for approval of this Agreement or consented
thereto in writing and with respect to which a demand for payment and
appraisal has been properly made in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(" _Dissenting Shares_ ") or shares that have not voted in favor of the
Merger and with respect to which dissenters rights have not terminated will
not be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving corporation the
Per Share Price otherwise payable with respect to such shares at or after the
Effective Time. If a holder of Dissenting Shares (a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ ") withdraws his or her demand for such payment and
appraisal or such Dissenting Shares (or such other shares with respect to
which dissenters rights have not terminated) become ineligible for such
payment and appraisal, then, as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of
such event of withdrawal or ineligibility, whichever last occurs, such
holders Dissenting Shares will cease to be Dissenting Shares (or, in the
case of such other shares, the dissenters rights shall have terminated) and
each share of Company Common Stock will be converted into the right to
receive, and will be exchangeable for, the Per Share Price into which such
Dissenting Shares would have been converted pursuant to Section 1.5.

  



  

(b) The Company shall give Buyer and Sub prompt notice of any demand received
by the Company from a holder of Dissenting Shares for appraisal of shares of
Company Capital Stock, and Buyer shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demand. The Company
agrees that, except with the prior written consent of Buyer and Sub, or as
required under the DGCL, it will not voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer or agree to settle,

  



  

5      
   



  

any such demand for appraisal. Each Dissenting Stockholder who, pursuant to
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment of the
value of the Dissenting Shares will receive payment therefor after the value
therefor has been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such
provisions, and any Per Share Price that would have been payable with respect
to such Dissenting Shares will be retained by Buyer.

  



  

 **Section 1.13** ** _Closing_. **The closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") and all
actions specified in this Agreement to occur at the Closing shall take place
at the offices of Buyer, One Lillehei Plaza, St. Paul, Minnesota no later
than the second business day following the day on which the last of the
conditions set forth in Article VI shall have been fulfilled or waived (if
permissible) (the " _Closing Date_ ") or at such other time and place as
Buyer and the Company shall agree.

generally in the United States or foreign economies in any locations where
the Company and its Subsidiaries have material operations or sales; (ii)
conditions generally affecting the industries in which the Company
participates, provided, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii), the changes,

other arrangements in existence on the date of this Agreement and disclosed
in the Company Letter; (iv) any action taken by the Company with Buyers
express written consent (except that consent to action taken to respond to a
Material Adverse Effect or a Material Adverse Change shall not be deemed any
waiver by Buyer as to the event or circumstance giving rise to such Material
Adverse Effect or Material Adverse Change); (v) the announcement or pendency
of the Merger to the extent the same causes cancellation or delay in placing
customer or potential customer orders, (vi) any change in the trading price
of the Companys common stock in and of itself; or (vii) any failure, in and
of itself, by the Company to meet internal or other estimates, predictions,
projections or forecasts of revenue, net income or any other measure of
financial performance (it being understood that, with respect to clauses (vi)
and (vii), the facts or circumstances giving rise or contributing to such
change in trading price or failure to meet estimates or projections may be
deemed to constitute, or be taken into account in determining whether there
has been, a Material Adverse Effect).

  



  

(c) Since the Balance Sheet Date, the Company has not incurred any
liabilities (including Tax liabilities), of any nature, whether absolute or
contingent, of a type required to be recorded on a balance sheet or disclosed

Entity necessary for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to own, lease and
operate its properties or to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "), and no suspension or cancellation of
any of the Company Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened.  Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been in
violation of (i) any Company Permits, or (ii) any applicable law, ordinance,
administrative, or governmental rule or regulation, including any consumer
protection, equal opportunity, customs, export control, foreign trade,
foreign corrupt practices (including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act),
patient confidentiality, health, health care industry regulation and third-
party reimbursement laws including under any Federal Health Care Program (as
defined in Section 1128B(f) of the U.S. Federal Social Security Act (together
with all regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _SSA_ ")), except in the
case of any violations of any law, ordinance, administrative, or governmental
rule or regulation described in (ii) that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(b) The Company is not subject to any consent decree from any Governmental
Entity.  The Company has not received any warning letter from the FDA

  



  

14      
   



  

during the last three years. The Company has received no communication from
any regulatory agency or been notified during the last three years that any
product approval is withdrawn or modified or that such an action is under
consideration. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company is in compliance,
in all respects, with all current applicable statutes, rules, regulations,
guidelines, policies or orders administered or issued by the FDA or
comparable foreign Governmental Entity including FDAs Quality System
Regulation, 21 C.F.R. Part 820; the Company does not have knowledge of any
facts which furnish any reasonable basis for any Form FDA-483 observations or
regulatory or warning letters from the FDA, Section 305 notices, or other
similar communications from the FDA or comparable foreign entity; and since
April 30, 1999, there have been no recalls, field notifications, alerts or
seizures requested or threatened relating to the Companys products, except
set forth in Section 3.8 of the Company Letter. The Companys products, where
required, are being marketed under valid pre market notifications under
Section 510 (k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C.
§360(k), and 21 C.F.R. Part 807, Subpart E (" _510(k) s_") or pre-market
approval applications approved by the FDA in accordance with 21 U.S.C.§360(e)
and 21 C.F.R. Part 814 (" _PMA s_"). All 510(k)s and PMAs for the
Companys products are exclusively owned by the Company, and there is no
reason to believe that FDA is considering limiting, suspending, or revoking
any such 510(k)s or PMAs or changing the marketing classification or
labeling of any such products. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no
false information or significant omission in any product application or
product-related submission to the FDA or comparable foreign Governmental
Entity. The Company has obtained all necessary regulatory approvals from any
foreign regulatory agencies related to the products distributed and sold by
the Company. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary, nor the officers,
directors, managing employees or agents (as those terms are defined in 42
C.F.R. §1001.1001) of the Company or any Subsidiary: (i) have engaged in any
activities which are prohibited under, or are cause for civil penalties or
mandatory or permissive exclusion from, any Federal Health Care Program under
Sections 1128, 1128A, 1128B, or 1877 of SSA or related state or local
statutes, including knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or
receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate),
directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind in return
for, or to induce, the purchase, lease, or order, or the arranging for or
recommending of the purchase, lease or order, of any item or service for
which payment may be made in whole or in part under any such program; (ii)
have had a civil monetary penalty assessed against them under Section 1128A
of SSA; (iii) have been excluded from participation under any Federal Health
Care Program; or (iv) have been convicted (as defined in 42 C.F.R. § 1001.2)
of any of the categories of offenses described in Sections 1128(a) or
1128(b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of SSA.

  



  

(c) There are no contracts or agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries
having terms or conditions which would have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or having covenants not to compete that materially impair the ability
of the Company to conduct its business as currently conducted or would
reasonably be expected to impair Buyers ability to conduct its businesses in
any material respect.

not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, (i)
the

  



  

15

defined) required to have been filed by them, and such Tax Returns are
correct and complete in all respects; (ii) the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has timely paid (taking account of extensions to pay that have

of its Taxes, which remains open; (v) no federal, state, local, or foreign
audits or administrative proceedings, of which the Company or any Subsidiary
has notice, are pending with regard to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the Company and its Subsidiaries have
not received a written notice of any proposed audit or proceeding from the
Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") or any other taxing authority; (vi)
there is currently no limitation on the utilization of net operating losses,
capital losses, built-in losses, tax credits or similar items of the Company
and its Subsidiaries under Sections 269, 382, 383, 384 or 1502 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and comparable provisions of state,
local or foreign law); (vii) the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied
with the requirements of Section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ ") and similar laws of foreign jurisdictions with
respect to intercompany transactions and have maintained complete and
accurate records to substantiate the pricing of such transactions; (viii) no
claim has been made by any taxing authority in any jurisdiction where the
Company and its subsidiaries do not file Tax Returns that they are or may be
subject to Tax by that jurisdiction; (ix) neither the Company nor any
subsidiary has been a member of an affiliated group of corporations (within
the meaning of Section 1504(a)) filing a consolidated federal income tax
return (or a group of corporations filing a consolidated, combined, or
unitary income tax return under comparable provisions of state, local, or
foreign tax law) for any taxable period, other than a group the common parent
of which is Company; (x) the Company does not have any obligation under any
agreement or arrangement with any other Person with respect to Taxes of such
other Person (including pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or
comparable provision of state, local or foreign tax law) including any
liability for Taxes of any predecessor entity; (xiv) the unpaid Taxes of the
Company and its Subsidiaries do not exceed the reserve for Tax
liability (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
temporary differences between book and Tax income) set forth or included in
the Companys most recent balance sheet as adjusted for the passage of time
through the Closing Date, and (xi) Section 3.9 of the Company Letter sets
forth all foreign jurisdictions in which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries are subject to Tax, are engaged in business or have a permanent
establishment. For purposes of this Agreement: (A) " _Taxes_ " means any
federal, state, local, foreign or provincial income, gross receipts,
property, sales, use, license, franchise, employment, payroll, withholding,
alternative or added minimum, ad valorem, value-added, transfer, excise,
capital, or net worth tax, or other tax, custom, duty, governmental fee or

any of the directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents
or stockholders of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as such, any of
the Companys or its Subsidiaries properties, assets or business or any
Company Plan (as hereinafter defined). Except for any actions, suits or
claims or legal, administrative or arbitrative proceedings or investigations
(including claims for workers compensation) for which the Companys
reasonably expected uninsured exposure, in the aggregate, is less than
$300,000, there are no actions, suits or claims or legal, administrative or
arbitrative proceedings or investigations (including claims for workers
compensation) pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against
or involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their
respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents or
stockholders, as such, or any of the Companys or the
Subsidiaries properties, assets or business or any Company Plan.

  



  

 **Section 3.11** ** _Certain Agreements_. **(a) Except as set forth in
Section 3.11(a) of the Company Letter, neither the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any oral or written agreement, program, plan or
other arrangement relating to the compensation of employees of the Company,
including any employment agreement, severance agreement, stock option plan,
stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan,
pension plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) or welfare plan
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) (collectively the " _Compensation

vesting of the benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the value of any of
the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 3.11(a) of the
Company Letter sets forth for each officer, director or employee who is a
party to, or will receive benefits under, any Compensation Agreement as a
result of the transactions contemplated herein, the total amount that each
such Person may receive, or is eligible to receive, assuming that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated on the date
hereof. There is no current indebtedness owed to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from each officer, director or employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(b) Set forth in Section 3.11(b) of the Company Letter is a list of all
Material Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
as of the date hereof or to which any of its assets are bound. Prior to the
date hereof, the Company has made available true and complete copies of all
such Material Contracts to Buyer. " _Material Contracts_ " means any of the
following contracts, agreements or

  



  

17      
   



  

arrangements (other than purchase or sales orders entered into in the
ordinary course), whether written or oral, currently in effect and binding:

of Regulation S-K promulgated by the Securities Exchange Commission);

  



  

(ii) any contract or commitment that involves a dollar amount in excess of
$100,000 or extends for a period of 12 months or more (other than any

(v) any partnership or joint venture agreement;

  



  

(vi) any lease or other occupancy or use agreements related to Real Estate,

reduction in price or refund of payments previously made;

  



  

(viii) any agreements for the borrowing or lending of money and any guaranty

18      
   



  

(xiii) any non-competition or confidentiality agreement relating to the
business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other contract
restricting its right to conduct the business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at any time, in any manner or at any place in the world, or the
expansion thereof to other geographical areas, customers, suppliers or lines
of business; or

  



  

(xiv) any license agreement granting any right to use or practice any rights
under any Intellectual Property (whether inbound or outbound).

  



  

(c) Except as set forth on Section 3.11(c) of the Company Letter, and except
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect:  each Material Contract is a legal, valid and binding agreement of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries (or to the knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto) is
in default under any Material Contract, and none of such Material Contracts
has been canceled by the other party thereto; each Material Contract is in
full force and effect and no event has occurred which, with the passage of
time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute a default, event of
default or other breach by the Company or any Subsidiaries party thereto
which would entitle the other party to such Material Contract to terminate
the same or declare a default or event of default thereunder; to the
knowledge of the officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Company
and its Subsidiaries are not in receipt of any claim of default under any
such agreement.

  



  

 **Section 3.12** ** _ERISA_. ** (a) Each Company Plan is listed in Section
3.12(a) of the Company Letter.  With respect to each Company Plan, the
Company has made available to Buyer a true and correct copy of (i) the three
most recent annual reports (Form 5500) filed with the applicable government
agency, (ii) each such Company Plan that has been reduced to writing and all
amendments thereto, (iii) each trust agreement, insurance contract or
administration agreement relating to each such Company Plan, (iv) a written
summary of each unwritten Company Plan, (v) the most recent summary plan
description or other written explanation of each Company Plan provided to
participants, (vi) the most recent actuarial report or valuation relating to
a Company Plan subject to Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), (vii) the most recent determination
letter or opinion letter and request therefor, if any, issued by the IRS with
respect to any Company Plan intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of
the Code, (viii) any request for a determination currently pending before the

Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation relating to any outstanding controversy
or with respect to any matter that has been resolved in the previous three
years and (x) all forms and certificate samples used to comply with Sections
4980, 9801 and 9802 of the Code. Each Company Plan complies in form and
has complied in operation in all material respects with ERISA, the Code and
all other applicable statutes and governmental rules and regulations. Except
as set forth in Section 3.12(a) of the Company Letter, no "reportable event"
(within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred with respect to
any Company Plan for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived.
 Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates (as
hereinafter defined) has had any obligation to contribute to any Company

  



  

19      
   



  

Multiemployer Plan within the past six (6) years. No action has been taken,
or is currently being considered, to terminate or withdraw from any Company
Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA and there is no reason to believe
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation would initiate the termination of
any such Plan. No Company Plan, nor any trust created thereunder, has
incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of
ERISA), whether or not waived.

  



  

(b) Except for routine contributions due and owing, with respect to the
Company Plans, no event has occurred and there exists no condition or set of
circumstances in connection with which the Company or any Subsidiary or ERISA
Affiliate or Company Plan fiduciary could be subject to any material
liability under the terms of such Company Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other
applicable law.  All Company Plans that are intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code have been determined by the IRS to be so
qualified, or a timely application for such determination is now pending and
the Company is not aware of any reason why any such Company Plan is not so
qualified in operation. Except as disclosed in Section 3.12(b) of the Company
Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates
has any material liability or obligation under any welfare plan to provide
benefits after termination of employment to any employee or dependent other
than as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

  



  

(c) As used herein, (i) " _Company Plan_ " means a "pension plan" (as defined
in Section 3(2) of ERISA (including a Company Multiemployer Plan)), a

or oral bonus, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation,
stock ownership, stock purchase, stock option, phantom stock, restricted
stock, stock appreciation right, holiday pay, vacation, severance, medical,
dental, vision, disability, death benefit, sick leave, fringe benefit,
personnel policy, insurance or other plan, program, agreement, arrangement or
understanding, in each case established or maintained by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates or as to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has contributed or otherwise may have
any liability, (ii) " _Company Multiemployer Plan_ " means a "multiemployer
plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates is or has been obligated to
contribute or otherwise may have any liability, and (iii) " _ERISA Affiliate_
" means any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which would be

(c), (m) or (o) of the Code and the regulations promulgated under
those sections or pursuant to Section 4001(b) of ERISA and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.

  



  

(d) Section 3.12(d) of the Company Letter contains a list of all (i)
severance and employment agreements with employees of the Company and each

20      
   



  

(e) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(e) of the Company Letter, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement, contract or
arrangement that could result, separately or in the aggregate, in the
payment, acceleration or enhancement of any benefit as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby including, without limitation, the payment
of any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Code.

  



  

(f) There is no Company Plan that is subject to the laws of a foreign
government or jurisdiction.

  



  

 **Section 3.13** ** _Compliance with Worker Safety Laws_.**  The
properties, assets and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state, local
and foreign laws, rules and regulations, orders, decrees, judgments, permits
and licenses relating to public and worker health and safety (collectively, "
_Worker Safety Laws_ ").  With respect to such properties, assets and
operations, including any previously owned, leased or operated properties,
assets or operations, there are no past, present or reasonably anticipated
future events, conditions, circumstances, activities, practices, incidents,
actions or plans of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that may interfere
with or prevent compliance or continued compliance in all material respects
with applicable Worker Safety Laws.

  



  

 **Section 3.14** ** _Products_.** Since December 31, 1999, other than
service support claims made in the ordinary course of business regarding the
Companys products currently under warranty, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received a claim for or based upon breach of product
or service warranty or guaranty or similar claim, strict liability in
tort, negligent design of product, negligent provision of services or any
other allegation of liability, including or arising from the materials,
design, testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling (including instructions for
use), or sale of its products or from the provision of services; and there is
no basis for any such claim.

  



  

 **Section 3.15** ** _Labor and Employment Matters_.**  (a) Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any collective bargaining
agreement or labor contract. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has engaged in any unfair labor practice with respect to any persons employed
by or otherwise performing services primarily for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the " _Company Business Personnel_ "), and there is no unfair
labor practice complaint or grievance against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or by any Person pursuant to the National Labor Relations Act or
any comparable state agency or foreign law pending or threatened in writing
with respect to the Company Business Personnel. There is no labor strike,
dispute, slowdown or stoppage pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against or affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
may interfere with the respective business activities of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with all Applicable Laws relating to the employment of
labor.

  



  

(b) Except for such incorrect classifications as would not be expected to
result in a liability of more than $300,000 in the aggregate, (i) all
individuals

  



  

21      
   



  

who are performing consulting or other services for the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company are or were correctly classified by the Company as
either "independent contractors" or "employees" as the case may be and (ii)
all employees of the Company and any Subsidiary of the Company have been
correctly classified as "exempt" or "non-exempt" under the Fair Labor
Standards Act.

  



  

(c) Section 3.15(c) of the Company Letter contains a list of the name of each
officer, employee and independent contractor of the Company and each
Subsidiary of the Company, together with such persons position or function,
annual base salary or wages and any incentives or bonus arrangement with
respect to such person. The Company has made available to Buyer all form
1099s filed with the IRS for the past three years.

  



  

 **Section 3.16** ** _Intellectual Property_.** (a) As used herein, the term
" _Intellectual Property_ " means all intellectual property rights arising
under the laws of the United States or any other jurisdiction with respect to
the following: (i) trade names, trademarks and service marks (registered and
unregistered), domain names, trade dress and similar rights and applications
to register any of the foregoing (collectively, " _Marks_ "); (ii) patents
and patent applications and rights in respect of utility models or industrial
designs (collectively, " _Patents_ "); (iii) copyrights and registrations and
applications therefor (collectively, " _Copyrights_ "); and (iv) know-how,
inventions, discoveries, methods, processes, technical data, specifications,
research and development information, technology, data bases and other
proprietary or confidential information, including customer lists, in each
case that derives economic value (actual or potential) from not
being generally known to other persons who can obtain economic value from
its disclosure, but excluding any Copyrights or Patents that cover or protect
any of the foregoing (collectively, " _Trade Secrets_ ").

  



  

(b) Section 3.16(b)(1) of the Company Letter sets forth an accurate and
complete list of all registered Marks and applications for registration of
Marks owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively "
_Company Registered Marks_ "), Section 3.16(b)(2) of the Company Letter sets
forth an accurate and complete list of all Patents owned by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (collectively the " _Company Patents_ " and, together
with the Company Registered Marks and the Company Patents, the " _Company
Registered IP_ ").  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary owns any
registered Copyrights or pending applications for registration of Copyrights.
No Company Registered IP has been or is now involved in any interference,
reissue, reexamination, opposition or cancellation proceeding and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no such action is or has been threatened with
respect to any of the Company Registered IP. The Company Registered IP
relating to the Companys existing products and products currently under
development is valid, subsisting and, to the knowledge of the Company,
enforceable, and no notice or claim challenging the validity or
enforceability or alleging the misuse of any of the Company Registered IP has
been received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as may be set
forth in Section 3.16(b) of the Company Letter, (i) the Company has not taken
any action or failed to take any action that could reasonably be expected to
result in the abandonment, cancellation, forfeiture, relinquishment,
invalidation or unenforceability of any of the

  



  

22      
   



  

Company Registered IP, and (ii) all filing, examination, issuance, post
registration and maintenance fees, annuities and the like associated with or
required with respect to any of the Company Registered IP have been timely
paid, except for any such actions and failures as would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable steps to protect
their rights in the Intellectual Property owned by the Company or its
Subsidiaries and maintain the confidentiality of all material Trade Secrets
of the Company or its Subsidiaries. All current or former employees,
consultants and contractors who have participated in the creation of any
Intellectual Property that is used by the Company or its Subsidiaries have
entered into proprietary information, confidentiality and assignment
agreements substantially in the Companys standard forms (which have
previously been made available to Buyer).

  



  

(d) The Company or its Subsidiaries own, or possess adequate licenses or
other valid rights to use, all of the Intellectual Property that is necessary
for the conduct or contemplated conduct of the Companys businesses. None of
the Intellectual Property owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries is subject
to any outstanding order, judgment, or stipulation restricting the use
thereof by the Company or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(e) The rights licensed under each agreement granting to the Company any
material right or license under or with respect to any Intellectual Property
owned by a third party shall be exercisable by the Surviving Corporation on
and after the Closing to the same extent in all material respects as by the
Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. No loss or expiration of
any such agreement is pending or reasonably foreseeable or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened. Any and all license fees, royalties, or other
amounts due with respect to any such licensed Intellectual Property licensed
have been paid in full. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
granted to any third party any exclusive rights under any Intellectual
Property owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise granted any
rights under such Intellectual Property outside the ordinary course of
business.

  



  

(f) The Intellectual Property owned by or validly licensed to the Company and
its Subsidiaries constitutes all the material Intellectual Property rights
necessary for the conduct of the Companys business as it is currently
conducted and contemplated to be conducted.

  



  

(g) None of the products or services distributed, sold or offered by the
Company and its Subsidiaries, nor any technology, materials or Intellectual
Property used, sold, distributed or otherwise commercially exploited by or
for the Company and its Subsidiaries, in any material respect, infringes
upon, misappropriates or violates any Intellectual Property of any third
party or constitutes unfair competition or trade practices under the laws of
any jurisdiction, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice or claim asserting or suggesting in writing that any such
infringement, misappropriation, violation, or dilution, unfair competition or
trade practices has occurred, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, is there
any reasonable

  



  

23      
   



  

basis therefor. To the knowledge of the Company, (i) no third party is, in
any material respect, misappropriating or infringing any
material Intellectual Property owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries and

Agreement dated July 12, 2004 between Buyer and the Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

  



  

(b) The Company agrees to provide Buyer and its agents and representatives
with reasonable access to its employees during normal working hours following
the date of this Agreement, and after consultation with the Company to, among
other things, deliver offers of continued employment contingent upon Closing
and to provide information to such employees about Buyer; _provided,
however,_  that the

  



  

34      
   



  

Company and its agents and representatives shall be permitted to participate
in such activities.

  



  

(c) During the Pre Closing Period, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, permit Buyers senior officers to meet during normal working
hours with the controller and other officers of the Company responsible for
the Companys financial statements and the internal controls of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to discuss such matters as Buyer may deem necessary or
appropriate for Buyer to satisfy its obligations under the Sarbanes Oxley
Act.

  



  

 **Section 5.2** ** _Fees and Expenses_.** Whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors
and accountants, shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and
expenses.

  



  

 **Section 5.3** ** _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. **(a) Between the date
hereof and the earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the Closing
Date, the Company will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries, and each of
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives or
affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, take any of the following actions
with any Person other than Buyer and Sub: (i) solicit, initiate, entertain,
encourage or facilitate any proposals or offers from, or conduct discussions
with or engage in negotiations with any Person relating to an Alternative
Transaction; (ii) provide information with respect to it to any Person, other
than Buyer and Sub, relating to, or otherwise cooperate with, facilitate or
encourage any effort or attempt by any such Person with regard to, an
Alternative Transaction; or (iii) enter into any agreement with any Person
providing for an Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company Board will be permitted, prior to obtaining Company Stockholder
Approval, and subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section 5.3
and to first entering into a confidentiality agreement with the Person
proposing an Alternative Transaction (an " _Acquisition Proposal_ ") on terms
substantially similar to, and no less favorable to the Company than, those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, in response to a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that is, or could reasonably be believed to
constitute, a Superior Proposal to consider and participate in discussions
and negotiations with respect to such proposal and provide information in
connection therewith.

  



  

(b) As used in this Agreement:

  



  

(i) " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (i) a transaction pursuant to
which any Person (or group of Persons) other than Buyer or Sub, directly or
indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 10% of the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock or outstanding voting power or of any new series or
new class of preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote
with respect to the

  



  

35   

      
  

  



  

Merger, whether from the Company or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange
offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation or other business combination involving the Company (other than
the Merger), (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any Person (or group of
Persons) other than Buyer or Sub acquires or would acquire control of assets
(including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of any
Subsidiary) of the Company representing more than 10% of the fair market
value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of the Company on a
consolidated basis immediately prior to such transaction, (iv) any other
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as a result of which the holders of shares of
Company Capital Stock immediately prior to such transaction do not, in the
aggregate, own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of capital stock and
outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity in such
transaction immediately after the consummation thereof, or (v) any other
transaction that is conditioned or predicated on the Merger not being
completed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or is intended or
could reasonably be expected to result in the Merger not being so completed;
and

  



  

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written proposal (not
solicited by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives
after the date hereof or otherwise resulting from a breach of Section 5.3(a))
made by a third party after the date of this Agreement that if consummated
would result in such third party (or the holders of its equity) owning,
directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the shares of Company Capital Stock
then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or
indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially
all the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel) to be (A) more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a
financial point of view than the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
proposal and this Agreement including any changes to the financial terms of
this Agreement proposed by Buyer in response to such offer or otherwise), and
(B) reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all
financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

  



  

(c) The Company will notify Buyer as promptly as practicable (but in no event
later than 48 hours) orally, to be promptly followed up in writing, after
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any material modification of or
material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any request for non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access
to the properties, books or records of the Company or of its Subsidiaries by
any Person that informs the Company Board that it is considering making or
has made an Acquisition Proposal.  Such notice to Buyer will be made orally
and in writing, and will indicate the identity of the Person making the
Acquisition Proposal or intending to make or considering making an
Acquisition Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to the
books and records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the material
terms (including the

  



  

36      
   



  

amount) of any such Acquisition Proposal or modification or amendment to an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company will keep Buyer informed, on a reasonably
current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes
or modifications in the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or
request. The Company will also as promptly as practicable, and in any event
within 48 hours, notify Buyer, orally and promptly followed up in writing, if
it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition
Proposal in accordance with Section 5.3(a).

  



  

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof will (i) (A) withdraw
(or modify in a manner adverse to Buyer) the recommendation by the Company
Board or any such committee in favor of this Agreement and the Merger, (B)
determine that this Agreement or the Merger is no longer advisable, (C)
recommend that the stockholders of the Company reject this Agreement or the
Merger, (D) resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any such actions, or
(E) recommend the approval or adoption of any Acquisition Proposal, unless in
each case, a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a
Superior Proposal has been made and the Company Board or a committee thereof
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
failure to take any such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law, (ii) adopt or approve any Acquisition Proposal
or withdraw its approval of this Agreement or the Merger (except as permitted
under Section 5.3(d)(i), or resolve or agree to take any such actions except
as specifically permitted by this Section 5.3(d), (iii) without limiting
Section 5.3(d)(i), propose publicly to adopt or approve any Acquisition
Proposal or propose publicly to withdraw its approval of this Agreement or
the Merger or resolve or agree to take any such actions, or (iv) cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum or understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement, or another agreement (each, an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or related to, or which
is intended or reasonably likely to lead to any Alternative Transaction or
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 5.3(a)) or resolve or agree to take any such actions (each board
action set forth in clauses (i)-(iv) of this Section 5.3(d) being referred to
herein as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, prior to obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, the Company
Board may in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(g) and concurrently approve, recommend and authorize the Company to enter
into a binding Alternative Acquisition Agreement containing the terms of a
Superior Proposal; _provided, however,_ that (1) the Company Board may not
terminate this agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g), and any purported
termination pursuant to Section 7.1(g) will be void and of no force or
effect, unless the Company has complied with all provisions of this Section
5.3, including the notification provisions in this Section 5.3, and with all
applicable requirements of Section 7.5 (including the payment of the
Termination Fee prior to or simultaneously with such termination) and (2) the
Company may not exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1(g), (x) until after the second business day following
Buyers receipt of written notice from the Company advising Buyer that the
Company Board has received a Superior Proposal and that the Company Board
will, subject to any action taken by Buyer pursuant to this sentence, cause
the

  



  

37      
   



  

Company to accept such Superior Proposal, which notice will specify the terms
and conditions of the Superior Proposal and identify the Person making such a
Superior Proposal (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") (it being understood
and agreed that any amendment to the price or any other material term of a
Superior Proposal will require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new
two business day period), and (y) unless after such second business day such
Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and the Company Board so
determines in accordance with the definition of "Superior Proposal".
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless and until this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with Section 7.1(g), nothing in this Section 5.3 will affect
the obligations of the Company or the rights of Buyer or Sub under any other
provision of this Agreement, including the obligation of the Company to seek
the Company Stockholder Approval pursuant to Section 5.6.

  



  

(e) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
officers, directors, agents and representatives to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any
persons (other than Buyer and its representatives) conducted heretofore with
respect to any of the foregoing and will use its best efforts to cause all
persons other than Buyer who have been furnished with confidential
information regarding the Company in connection with the solicitation of or
discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal within the 10 months prior to
the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information. The Company
agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party
from the confidentiality and stand still provisions of any agreement to which
the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or becomes a party, and will
immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have
heretofore been given under any such provisions authorizing any Person to
make an Acquisition Proposal, unless the Company Board determines in good
faith that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

  



  

(f) The Company will ensure that the officers, directors and all employees
agents and representatives of the Company or its Subsidiaries are aware of
the restrictions in this Section 5.3 as reasonably necessary to avoid
violations thereof. Any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
Section 5.3 by any officer, director, employee, agent or
representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant, or other retained representative) of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, at the direction or with the consent of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, will be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.3 by the
Company.

  



  

#### **Section 5.4** _Cooperation_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable
efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions and to do or cause to be
done all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable
Law to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each of the other Transaction Documents, including using all
reasonable efforts to do the following:  (i) cooperate in the preparation and
filing of any filings or notifications that must be made under the HSR Act or
otherwise to any Governmental Entities; (ii) cooperate in the preparation and
filing of the Proxy Statement;

  



  

38      
   



  

#### **(iii) obtain consents of all third parties and Governmental Entities
necessary, proper, advisable or reasonably requested by Buyer or the Company,
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iv)
contest any legal proceeding relating to the Merger; and (v) execute any
additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company agrees to use all reasonable efforts to
encourage its employees to accept any reasonable offers of employment
extended by Buyer. If at any time after the Effective Time any further action
is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers
and directors of each party hereto shall take all such necessary action.**

  

#### ** **

  

(b) Buyer and the Company will consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, letters, white papers, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, opinions or proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of
any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any
foreign, federal, or state antitrust, competition, or fair trade law. In this
regard but without limitation, each party hereto shall promptly inform the
other of any material communication between such party and the Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice, or any other federal, foreign or state antitrust or competition
Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated herein.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or otherwise, in
connection with the compliance by the parties hereto with any Applicable Law
(including the HSR Act and similar merger notification laws or regulations of
any foreign Governmental Entity) and obtaining the consent or approval of any
Governmental Entity whose consent or approval may be required to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall not be required,
or be construed to be required, to proffer to, or agree to: (i) sell or hold
separate, or agree to sell or hold separate, before or after the Effective
Time, any assets, businesses or any interests in any assets or businesses, of
Buyer, the Company or any of their respective affiliates (or to consent to
any sale, or agreement to sell, by Buyer or the Company of any assets or
businesses, or any interests in any assets or businesses), or any change in
or restriction on the operation by Buyer or the Company of any assets or
businesses, (ii) enter into any agreement or be bound by any obligation that,
in Buyers good faith judgment, would likely have an adverse effect on the
benefits to Buyer of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
(iii) take any other action that, in Buyers good faith judgment, would be
adverse to Buyer.

  



  

#### **Section 5.5** _Company Stock Options_. (a) The Company shall take
all requisite action so that, as of the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
or not then exercisable or vested, by virtue of the Merger and
without further action on the part of Buyer, Sub, the Company or the holder
of that Company Stock Option, shall be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive, on the date that is five days after the Closing Date, an amount
in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the Option Share Amount

  



  

39      
   



  

#### **multiplied by (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock into which the applicable Company Stock Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or
exercisable by its terms). The payment of the Option Share Amount to
the holder of a Company Stock Option shall be reduced by any income or
employment Tax withholding required under (A) the Code, or (ii) any
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws. To the extent that any amounts
are withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been
paid to the holder of that Company Stock Option.**

  

 ** **

  

(b) The " _Option Share Amount_ " means (i) the Per Share Amount less (ii)
the exercise or purchase price per share of Company Common Stock subject or
related to the applicable Company Stock Option.

  



  

(c) The Company shall take all action necessary in implementing the
provisions of this Section 5.5, including amendment of the Company Stock
Option Plans or the related option agreements pursuant to a resolution of the
Board of Directors in form and substance satisfactory to Buyer, and to ensure
that, after giving effect to the foregoing, no Company Stock Option shall be
exercisable for Company Common Stock following the Effective Time. At the
Effective Time, all Company Stock Options shall be cancelled and all Company
Stock Option Plans shall terminate, and the Company shall take all actions to
ensure that such cancellations and terminations occur. All administrative and
other rights and authorities granted under any Company Stock Option Plan to
the Company, the board of directors of the Company or any committee or
designee thereof, shall, following the Effective Time, reside with the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(d) The parties agree that the Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries will
treat all payments to holders of options pursuant to this Section 5.5 of this
Agreement as occurring after the Closing Date and accordingly will treat such
payments as governed for federal income tax purposes by the "Next Day Rule"
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).  Accordingly, the
parties shall, and shall cause all parties related to the Company pursuant to
Section 267(b) of the Code to, treat such payments as occurring no earlier
than the beginning of the day following the Closing Date and all Tax Returns
shall be filed consistently therewith.

  



  

 **Section 5.6** ** _Stockholder Approval_. **(a) The Company shall call a
meeting of its stockholders to be held as soon as reasonably practical for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval.  The Company
Board will use its best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval.
The Company Board will recommend that the stockholders of the Company vote in
favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, subject
to its fiduciary duties in respect of a Superior Proposal and in compliance
by the Company with Section 5.3.

  



  

(b) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement and other proxy materials relating
to the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger and the other

  



  

40      
   



  

transactions contemplated hereby by the stockholders of the Company.  The
Proxy Statement will comply in form in all material respects with applicable
law and SEC requirements and the Company shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be cleared
for use by the SEC as soon thereafter as practicable.  The Company shall use
all commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to
any comments of the SEC with respect thereto and to cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof.  Each of Buyer and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning it (and its respective Subsidiaries) to the other as
may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action and the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the
Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to
any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of Buyer and the Company,
as the case may be, (i) shall provide the other party with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response, (ii) shall
include in such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by such
other party, and (iii) shall not file or mail such document or respond to the
SEC prior to receiving such other partys approval, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Subject to the provisions of Section
5.3, the Proxy Statement shall include the unanimous recommendation of the
Company Board in favor of the Merger.

  



  

 **Section 5.7** **_Public Announcements_**. The parties have agreed on the
content of the press release to be issued by them upon entry into this
Agreement. Buyer and the Company will not issue any press release with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise issue
any written public statements with respect to such transactions without prior
consultation with the other party, except as may be required by applicable
law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
national securities exchange.

  



  

 **Section 5.8** **_Notification of Certain Matters_**. Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to give prompt notice to Buyer, of: (i)
the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of which it is aware and which would be reasonably likely to
cause (x) any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement and made
by it to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (y) any covenant,
condition or agreement contained in this Agreement and made by it not to be
complied with or satisfied in all material respects, (ii) any failure of
Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, to comply in a timely manner with
or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder, or (iii) any change or event which would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer or the Company,
as the case may be; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

  



  

 **Section 5.9** ** _Takeover Statutes_**. If any Takeover Statute or any
similar statute, law, rule or regulation in any State of the United States
(including under the DGCL or any other law of the State of Delaware) is or
may become applicable to the

  



  

41      
   



  

Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Board shall promptly grant such approvals and
take such lawful actions as are necessary so that such transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement or by the Merger and otherwise take such lawful actions to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute, law, rule or regulation,
on such transactions.

  



  

 **Section 5.9 _Company_ _ Rights Agreement_**.  The Company Board shall
take all further action (in addition to that referenced in Section 3.30) to
the extent necessary (including amending the Company Rights Agreement) in
order to ensure that following or as a result of the execution of this
Agreement, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (i)
no person shall be deemed to be an Acquiring Person; (ii) no person shall
have the ability to exercise any Company Rights under the Company Rights
Agreement; (iii) no Company Rights shall have separated from the Company
Common Stock to which they are attached or become exercisable; and (iv) the
Company shall not have the right to exchange any Company Rights for shares of
Company Common Stock, pursuant to Section 24 of the Company Rights
Agreement or otherwise. Except in connection with the foregoing sentence,
the Company Board shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, (A)
amend the Company Rights Agreement, or (B) take any action with respect to,
or make any determination under, the Company Rights Agreement, including a
redemption of the Company Rights, in each case in order to facilitate any
Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company; _provided, however_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company Board
may (X) amend the Company Rights Agreement solely for the purpose of
extending the Distribution Date thereunder to that time immediately prior to
the consummation of an unsolicited exchange or tender offer by a third party
and (Y) take any action in connection with the Company Rights Agreement that
is required by order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

  



  

 **Section 5.10** ** _Section 16 Matters_**. Buyer, Sub and the Company
agree to cooperate fully in the structuring and timing of any dispositions
and acquisitions of equity securities by directors and officers (as defined
in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) of the Company pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to take, and cause
their respective boards of directors or compensation committees to take,
prior to the Effective Time, any and all such actions as may be reasonably
necessary to afford an exemption from liability under Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act for such acquisitions and dispositions.

  



  

 **Section 5.11** ** _Employee Benefit Matters_. (a) **With respect to each
employee benefit plan of Buyer (" _Buyer Benefit Plan_ ") in which employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries (" _Company Employees_ ") participate
after the Effective Time, for purposes of determining vesting and entitlement
to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation entitlement,
service with the Company (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company
provides past service credit) shall be treated as service with Buyer;
provided, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or to the extent

  



  

42      
   



  

that such service was not recognized under the corresponding Company Plan. To
the extent required by Applicable Law, Buyer shall cause any and all pre-
existing condition (or actively at work or similar) limitations, eligibility
waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under Buyer Benefit
Plans to be waived with respect to such Company Employees and their eligible
dependents and shall provide them with credit for any co-payments,
deductibles, and offsets (or similar payments) made during the plan year
including the Effective Time for the purposes of satisfying any applicable
deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirements under any Buyer Benefit
Plans in which they are eligible to participate after the Effective Time.

  

 ** **

  

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 5.11 with respect to employees are included for the sole benefit
of the respective parties hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any
other person, including, without limitation, any employees, former employees,
any participant in any Company Plan or any beneficiary thereof or (ii) to
continued employment with the Company or Buyer. After the Effective Time,
nothing contained in this Section 5.11 shall interfere with Buyers right to
amend, modify or terminate any Company Plan or Buyer Benefit Plan or
to terminate the employment of any employee of the Company for any reason.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall take no action
to amend, modify or terminate, and Buyer shall take all action necessary to
assume the Companys obligations under the employment agreements set forth in
Section 3.11(b)(iii) of the Company Letter.

  



  

 **Section 5.12** ** _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. **(a) After
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless (and shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law to), each person who is now or has been prior
to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or
director of the Company or any Subsidiary (the " _Indemnified Persons_ ")
against (i) all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including counsel
fees and expenses), settlement, payments or liabilities arising out of or in
connection with any claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact
that such person is or was an officer or director of the Company or any
Subsidiary, whether or not pertaining to any matter existing or occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time and whether or not asserted or claimed prior
to or at or after the Effective Time, and for which indemnification has been
provided by the Company in accordance with Applicable Law (" _Indemnified
Liabilities_ "); and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in
part on or arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the fullest extent a
corporation is permitted under the DGCL to indemnify its own directors and
officers.  Nothing contained herein shall make Buyer, Sub, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, an insurer, a co-insurer or an excess insurer in
respect of any insurance policies which

  



  

43      
   



  

may provide coverage for Indemnified Liabilities, nor shall this Section 5.12
relieve the obligations of any insurer in respect thereto. Each Indemnified
Person is intended to be a third party beneficiary of this Section 5.12.
 This Section 5.12 shall survive the consummation of the Merger at
the Effective Time, is intended to benefit each Indemnified Person and his or
her heirs and representatives, each of whom may specifically enforce its
terms against Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of Buyer and the Surviving Corporation. This
Section 5.12 shall not limit or otherwise adversely affect any rights any
Indemnified Person may have under any agreement with the Company or under the
Companys Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws as presently in effect.

  

 ** **

  

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to
any indemnification agreements between the Company and its directors and
officers as of or prior to the date hereof and any indemnification provisions
under the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) At Buyers option, Buyer will either: (i) cause the Surviving Corporation
to purchase tail liability insurance covering those persons who, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, are covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy for a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time on terms no less favorable than those of the
Companys present directors and officers liability insurance policy;
_provided, however_ , that in no event will Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation be required to pay in excess of 300% of the annual premium most
recently paid by the Company for such coverage; _provided further_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event such coverage is not available
(or is only available for an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium
most recently paid by the Company for such coverage), Buyer shall
nevertheless use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such coverage
as may be obtained for such 300% amount, or (ii) provide indemnification to
those persons who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, are covered
by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy in an
amount equal to the amount of indemnification to which such persons would
have been entitled under the Companys present directors and officers
liability insurance policy.

  



  

(d) In the event the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all

# ** **

the Company:

  



  

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and the Company;

  



  

(b) by either Buyer or the Company, upon written notice to the other party,
if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a
final and nonappealable order, decree or ruling permanently enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (which order, decree, ruling or other action the parties shall
have used their reasonable efforts to resist, resolve or lift, as applicable,
subject to the provisions of Section 5.4);

  



  

(c) by either Buyer or the Company, upon written notice to the other party,
if Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at a meeting of
the stockholders of the Company called therefore, or any adjournment or
postponement thereof; _provided, however,_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to the Company
where the failure to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval shall have been
caused by the action or failure to act of the Company and such action or
failure to act constitutes a breach by the Company of this Agreement;

  



  

(d) by either Buyer or the Company if: (i) the Merger has not been
effected on or prior to the close of business on the later of February 28,
2005 or the date 75 days after the waiting period applicable to the
consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act has expired or been terminated
_; provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 7.1(d)(i) shall not be available to any party whose failure
to fulfill any of its obligations contained in this Agreement has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to have occurred on or
prior to the aforesaid date;

  



  

(e) by Buyer if there has been a breach of a representation or warranty of
the Company that gives rise to a failure of the fulfillment of a condition of
the Buyers and Subs obligations to effect the Merger pursuant to Section
6.3(a)(ii) and

  



  

47      
   



  

(iii) or by the Company if there has been a breach of a representation or
warranty of the Buyer or Sub that gives rise to a failure of the fulfillment
of a condition of the Companys obligations to effect the Merger pursuant to
Section 6.2(a)(ii) and (iii), in each case which breach has not been cured
within 30 calendar days following written notice to the party committing such
breach, or immediately, if such breach by its nature or timing cannot be
cured within such time period;

  



  

(f) by Buyer, upon written notice to the Company, in the event of a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change; or

  



  

(g) by the Company, upon written notice to the Buyer, if the Company Board
shall have exercised its rights set forth in Section 5.3(d); _provided,_
that, in order for the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section
7.1(g) to be deemed effective, the Company shall have complied with the
provisions of Section 5.3, including the notice provisions thereof and the
provisions of 7.5.

  



  

The right of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of any party hereto, any Person
controlling any such party or any of their respective officers or directors,
whether prior to or after the execution of this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 7.2** ** _Effect of Termination_**. In the event of termination
of this Agreement by either Buyer or the Company, as provided in Section 7.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability
hereunder on the part of the Company, Buyer, Sub or their respective officers
or directors (except for the last sentence of Section 5.1(a), Section
7.2, Section 7.5 and Article VIII which shall survive the termination);
_provided, however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 7.2 shall
relieve any party hereto from any liability for any breach of a
representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 7.3** ** _Amendment_**. Subject to compliance with Applicable
Law, this Agreement may be amended by the Company and Buyer (on behalf of
itself and Sub), by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company, except that
after any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company, there may not be, without further approval of
such stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement that reduces the amount or
changes the form of the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to
the holders of the Company Common Stock, other than as contemplated by this
Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

  



  

 **Section 7.4** ** _Waiver_**. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and

  



  

48      
   



  

(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein for the benefit of such party which may legally be waived. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party. No delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
waiver on the part of any party hereto of any right, power or privilege
hereunder operate as a waiver of any other right, power or privilege
hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. Unless otherwise
provided, the rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that the parties hereto may otherwise
have at law or in equity. The failure of any party to this Agreement
to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.

  



  

 **Section 7.5** ** _Termination Fees_**. (a) The Company will pay to Buyer,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to
$4,500,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") if this Agreement is terminated as
follows:

  



  

(i) if Buyer shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(f), then
the Company will pay the Termination Fee on the business day following such
termination; _provided, however,_ the Company shall not be required to pay
the Termination Fee if the Company was otherwise entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Sections 7.1(b), (d), or (e); and

  



  

(ii) if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g),
then the Company will pay the Termination Fee prior to such termination.

  



  

(b) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
7.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, Buyer would not enter into this
Agreement.  Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amounts
due pursuant to Section 7.5, the Company will also pay to Buyer interest on
such amount from the date this payment was due until the date it was made
equal to 8.5%, compounded monthly, on the date such payment was required to
be made.
