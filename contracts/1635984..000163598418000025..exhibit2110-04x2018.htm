be (i) in the form of the N.I.S. Reference Balance Sheet; (ii) prepared in
accordance with the N.I.S. Accounting Principles; (iii) derived from and
prepared using the relevant Books and Records; (iv) accompanied by work papers
and other supporting documentation with respect to the calculation of the

chief financial or accounting officer of Buyer certifying that the N.I.S.
Subject Balance Sheet (x) was prepared in good faith (y) is based upon the
Books and Records, and (z) was prepared in accordance with the N.I.S.
Accounting Principles. In furtherance of such preparation, Seller will make
reasonably available the employees of Seller (including the Chief Financial
Officer of Seller) and its Affiliates to Buyer and its Representatives to the
extent such employees are knowledgeable about matters reasonably relevant to
Buyer\'s preparation of the Subject Balance Sheets and shall provide access to
all documentation, records and other information of Seller and its Affiliates
as Buyer or any of its Representatives may reasonably request to the extent
reasonably relevant to the preparation of the Subject Balance Sheets;
provided, that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the business of Seller and its Affiliates.



(c)(i) Seller shall have sixty (60) days from the date on which the Final
Adjustment Statement is delivered to it (the "Review Period") to review the
Final Adjustment Statement, the Subject Balance Sheets and the calculations of
Ozark Closing Statutory Value, the N.I.S. Closing Working Capital and the
Adjustment Amount based thereon. In furtherance of such review, Buyer will,
and will cause the Companies to, make reasonably available the employees of
Buyer (including the Chief Financial Officer of Buyer) and the Companies to
Seller and its Representatives to the extent such employees are responsible
for or knowledgeable about the preparation of the Subject Balance Sheets and
shall provide access to all documentation, records and other information of
Buyer and the Companies as Seller or any of its Representatives may reasonably
request to the extent reasonably relevant to the preparation of the Subject
Balance Sheets; provided, that such access does not unreasonably interfere
with the conduct of the business of Buyer or the Companies.



(ii) If Seller believes that the Final Adjustment Statement (including any
amount or computation set forth therein) contains mathematical errors, was not
based on the Books and Records or was not prepared in accordance with the
Ozark Accounting Principles or the N.I.S. Accounting Principles, as
applicable, Seller may, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period,
deliver a notice to Buyer setting forth, in reasonable detail, each such
disputed item or amount and the basis for Seller\'s disagreement therewith
(the "Dispute Notice"). The Dispute Notice shall set forth, with respect to
each disputed item, Seller\'s position as to the correct amount or computation
that should have been included in the Final Adjustment Statement and as to the
Adjustment Amount.



(iii) If no Dispute Notice is received by Buyer with respect to any item in
the Final Adjustment Statement on or prior to the last day of the Review
Period, the amount or computation with respect to such item as set forth in
the Final Adjustment Statement shall be deemed accepted by Seller, whereupon
the amount or computation of such item shall be final and binding on the
parties.



(iv) For a period of ten (10) Business Days beginning on the date that Buyer
receives a Dispute Notice, if any, Buyer and Seller shall endeavor in good
faith to resolve by mutual agreement all matters identified in the Dispute
Notice. In the event that the parties are unable to resolve by mutual
agreement any matter in the Dispute Notice within such 10 Business Day period,
Seller may engage Deloitte LLP, or if Deloitte LLP is unwilling or unable to
serve, another accounting firm of national reputation or any other Person as
mutually agreed by the parties hereto (either being the "Independent
Accounting Firm"), to make a determination with respect to all matters in
dispute.



(v) Buyer and Seller will direct the Independent Accounting Firm to render a
determination within sixty (60) days after its retention, and Buyer, Seller
and their respective employees and agents will cooperate with the Independent
Accounting Firm during its engagement. Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on
the other hand, shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days) after the Independent Accounting Firm\'s engagement, each submit to the
Independent Accounting Firm their respective computations of the disputed
items identified in the Dispute Notice and information, arguments and support
for their respective positions, and shall concurrently deliver a copy of such
materials to the other party. Each party shall then be given an opportunity to
supplement the information, arguments and support included in its initial
submission with one additional submission to respond to any arguments or
positions taken by the other party in such other party\'s initial submission,
which supplemental information shall be submitted to the Independent
Accounting Firm (with a copy thereof to the other party) within five (5)
Business Days after the first date on which both parties have submitted their
respective initial submissions to the Independent Accounting Firm. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall thereafter be permitted to request
additional or clarifying information from the parties, and each of the parties
shall cooperate and shall cause their Representatives to cooperate with such
requests of the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall determine, based solely on the materials so presented by the parties and
upon information received in response to such requests for additional or
clarifying information and not by independent review, only those issues in
dispute specifically set forth in the Dispute Notice and shall render a
written report to Buyer and Seller (the "Adjustment Report") in which the
Independent Accounting Firm shall, after considering all matters set forth in
the Dispute Notice and applying the Ozark Accounting Principles and the N.I.S.
Accounting Principles, as applicable, determine what adjustments, if any,
should be made to the amounts and computations set forth in the Final
Adjustment Statement solely as to the disputed items and shall determine the
Adjustment Amount on that basis.



(vi) The Adjustment Report shall set forth, in reasonable detail, the
Independent Accounting Firm\'s determination with respect to each of the
disputed items or 

amounts specified in the Dispute Notice, and the revisions, if any, to be made
to the Final Adjustment Statement, together with supporting calculations. In
resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm (i) shall be
bound to the principles of this Section 2.5 and the terms of this Agreement,
(ii) shall limit its review to matters specifically set forth in the Dispute
Notice the basis of which are mathematical errors or the failure of Buyer to
prepare the Final Adjustment Statement based upon the Books and Records or in
accordance with the Ozark Accounting Principles and the N.I.S. Accounting
Principles, as applicable, and (iii) shall not assign a value to any disputed
item higher than the highest value for such item claimed by either party or
less than the lowest value for such item claimed by either party.



(vii) All fees and expenses relating to the work of the Independent Accounting
Firm shall be shared equally by Buyer and Seller. The Adjustment Report,
absent Fraud, shall be final and binding upon Buyer and Seller, and shall be
deemed a final arbitration award that is binding on each of Buyer and Seller,
and no party shall seek further recourse to courts, other tribunals or
otherwise, other than to enforce the Adjustment Report.



(viii) The final form of the balance sheet of Ozark as of the Closing Date as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.5 is referred to herein as the
"Ozark Final Balance Sheet" and the amount of the Ozark Closing Statutory
Value calculated therefrom is referred to as the "Ozark Final Closing
Statutory Value;" the final form of the balance sheet of N.I.S. as of the
Closing Date as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.5 is referred to
herein as the "N.I.S. Final Balance Sheet" and the amount of the N.I.S.
Closing Working Capital calculated therefrom is referred to as the "N.I.S.
Final Closing Working Capital;" and the Adjustment Amount as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.5 is referred to herein as the "Final
Adjustment Amount." Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the provisions of this Section 2.5 represent the sole and exclusive
method for determining the Ozark Final Balance Sheet, the Ozark Final Closing
Statutory Value, the N.I.S. Final Balance Sheet, the N.I.S. Final Closing
Working Capital, and the Final Adjustment Amount; provided, that, for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Section 2.5(c)(viii) is intended
or shall be construed to supersede, nullify, waive or in any way affect the
rights of Buyer under Article VII or Article VIII of this Agreement or in the
event of Fraud.



SECTION 2.6. Earn-Out Payment.



(a) Within ten (10) Business Days following the Renewal Retention Ratio
Determination Date, Buyer shall provide Seller with written notice of Buyer's
calculation of the Renewal Retention Ratio and reasonable supporting
documentation for such calculation. Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days
from the date of receipt of such notice to deliver written notice of its
objections to the Renewal Retention Ratio, specifying in reasonable detail the
basis for the objections. If Seller does not timely object, Buyer's
calculation of the Renewal Retention Ratio shall be binding and conclusive. If
Seller objects on a timely basis, the calculation of the Renewal Retention
Ratio will not be binding and conclusive, and Buyer and Seller shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve Seller's objections. If Buyer and Seller resolve such
objections, the amount they 

agree upon shall be final and binding, but if the objections cannot be
resolved by such negotiation within ten (10) Business Days after Buyer's
receipt of Seller's objections, Seller and Buyer shall cause the calculation
of the Renewal Retention Ratio, and all documents related thereto, to be
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm and the procedures, timelines and
expense allocations set forth in Section 2.5 with respect to the resolution of
the Closing Working Capital, to the extent applicable, shall be followed to
obtain final resolution of the Renewal Retention Ratio.



(b) Within five (5) Business Days following the final determination of the
Renewal Retention Ratio in accordance with subclause (a), the Buyer and the
Seller shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release to Buyer or Seller,
as applicable, the following amounts (each, an "Earn-Out Payment").

released to Seller and $5,000,000 shall be released to Buyer;



(ii)if the Renewal Retention Ratio is equal to or greater than 96.0% but less
than or equal to 96.5%, $1,000,000 shall be released to Seller and $4,000,000

(iii)if the Renewal Retention Ratio is greater than 96.5% but less than or
equal to 98.5%, $2,000,000 shall be released to Seller and $3,000,000 shall be
released to Buyer;



(iv)if the Renewal Retention Ratio is greater than 98.5% but less than or
equal to 99.25%, $3,000,000 shall be released to Seller and $2,000,000 shall
be released to Buyer;



(v)if the Renewal Retention Ratio is greater than 99.25% but less than or
equal to 99.9%, $4,000,000 shall be released to Seller and $1,000,000 shall be
released to Buyer; and



(vi)if the Renewal Retention Ratio is greater than 99.9%, $5,000,000 shall be
released to the Seller.



(c) Buyer and Seller understand and agree that any Earn-Out Payment paid to
the Seller is an integral part of the consideration payable to Seller in
connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and any of the
other Transaction Agreements. From and after the Closing and until January 1,
2022, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, take any action
or inaction in bad faith or with the intention or primary effect of decreasing
the amount of any Earn-Out Payment payable to Seller.

(f) Except as disclosed in Section 3.11(f) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby (alone or in combination with any event)
will result in, cause the accelerated

payment or benefit to any Company Employee or entitle any Company Employee to
severance or any other payment, in each case, pursuant to any Company Benefit
Plan. No amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form

the final regulations and other applicable guidance issued thereunder. No
Company has paid or owes compensation to any current or former employee or

compensation paid under such plan to become subject to the Tax imposed by
Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or 409A(b)(5) of the Code. Except as disclosed in
Section 3.11(f) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, no Person is entitled to

or omissions by the Seller or the Companies prior to the Closing. Except as

administered.



(i) Except as disclosed in Section 3.12 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the

Treasury Regulations, and forms issued by the Internal Revenue Service. Ozark
has maintained the information necessary to determine the Insurance
Contracts\' qualification for any applicable Tax treatment under the Code, to

contemplated thereby. Except as may be prohibited by Applicable Law, each of
the parties shall provide to the other party copies of all applications or
other communications to Governmental Entities in connection with this
Agreement in advance of the filing or submission thereof; provided, that

any such notice or communication which is in writing, shall promptly furnish
the other party with a copy thereof. If any Insurance Regulator or other
Governmental Entity requires that a hearing be held in connection with any
such approval, each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange for
such hearing to be held promptly after the notice that such hearing is
required has been received by such party. Each party shall give to the other
party reasonable prior written notice of the time and place when any meetings,
telephone calls or other conferences may be held by it with any Insurance
Regulator or other Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, and, unless prohibited by the

any condition, limitation, restriction or requirement, in each case that is
imposed by a Governmental Entity on such party or its Affiliates in connection

seek to commence any Action against a Governmental Entity or (iii) with
respect to either Buyer or Seller, a material negative effect on or impairment

funding or operation of the business of the Companies) and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement with respect to such
matters without the advance approval of the other party following such
consultation (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),

the Seller Disclosure Schedule, all of the Related Party Agreements will be

balances between Seller and its respective Affiliates (other than the
Companies), on the one hand, and such Company, on the other hand, to be paid

employment to each Scheduled Employee identified on Schedule 5.13(a) who is
actively employed (including any Scheduled Employee who is on vacation or
other paid-time off) as of the Closing Date for a position substantially
similar to the position held by such Scheduled Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date. On or prior to the Closing, Seller shall take all necessary
actions to terminate the employment with Seller or any of its Affiliates of
each such Scheduled Employee. With respect to any Scheduled Employee who is on
a leave of absence as of the Closing Date, whether paid or unpaid, including
leave under the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993 or short-term or long-term
disability leave (an "Inactive Employee"), Buyer shall make, or shall cause an
Affiliate of Buyer to make, an offer of employment to such Inactive Employee
in the manner specified in this Section 5.13(a), with such offer being
contingent upon such Inactive Employee returning to active status within six
(6) months following the Closing Date. Until an Inactive Employee returns to
active status and accepts the offer of employment made by Buyer or its
Affiliates, the Inactive Employee shall continue to be employed by Sellers or
an Affiliate of Seller during such six (6) month period. Each Scheduled
Employee identified on Schedule 5.13(a) who accepts the offer of employment
from Buyer or its affiliates or continues as an employee of the Companies
shall be referred to herein as a "Covered Employee".



(b) Terms and Conditions of Employment. For the benefit of each Covered
Employee and for a period of at least twelve (12) months from and after the
Closing Date while such Covered Employee remains employed, Buyer shall
provide, or cause the Companies to provide: (i) each Covered Employee with
base salary or wage rates that are comparable to those in effect for such
Covered Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date; and (ii) employee
benefits under Employee Benefit Plans no less favorable in the aggregate to
either (x) those Employee Benefit Plans sponsored by the Company (which shall
not include, for the avoidance of doubt, the CNS Corporation Equity
Participation Plan) and in effect as of the Closing Date or (y) those
maintained or contributed to by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer for similarly
situated Buyer employees (collectively, the "Buyer Benefit Plans").



(c) Seller Benefit Plan. Seller and its Affiliates shall retain the CNS
Corporation Equity Participation Plan (the "Seller Benefit Plan").
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Seller and
its Affiliates shall bear and be responsible, and indemnify and hold harmless,
Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company from and after the Closing
Date) for all liabilities and all obligations with respect to such Seller
Benefit Plan.



(d) Incentive and Equity Awards. Payments due to a Covered Employee under any
bonus, incentive, or equity or equity-based awards due under any Company
Benefit Plan, if any ("Company Incentive Award"), shall be paid by the Buyer
or its Affiliates in accordance with the terms and conditions of each
applicable plan.



(e) No Modification. The provisions of this Section 5.13 are for the sole
benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, express or
implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i) constitute an amendment to
or establishment of any Employee Benefit Plan or other compensation and
benefits plans maintained for or provided to Covered Employees or any other
Persons prior to or following the Closing Date, or (ii) confer upon or give to
any Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Covered Employee or any
current or former employees, directors, or independent contractors of the
Companies, Seller or any of their Affiliates, or on or after the Closing,
Buyer, the Companies or any of their post-Closing Affiliates), other than the
parties hereto, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies with
respect to the matters provided for in this Section 5.13 under or by reason of
any provision of this Agreement. Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no
obligation to continue to employ any Covered Employee following the Closing
and nothing in this Section 5.13 shall be construed to limit any rights Buyer
or its Affiliates have under any Buyer Benefit Plan or any other compensation
or benefit plan or arrangement to amend, modify or terminate any such plan or
arrangement.



SECTION 5.14. Notice of Certain Events. From the date hereof until the
Closing, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of: (i) any
circumstance, event or action of which Seller has Knowledge relating to Seller
or either Company the existence, occurrence or taking of which (A) has had, or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect or (B) has resulted or would reasonably be expected to
result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 or
6.2 to be satisfied and (ii) any Action commenced or, to the Knowledge of
Seller, threatened, against either Company that, if pending on the date
hereof, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section
3.14. From the date hereof until the Closing, Buyer shall promptly notify
Seller in writing of any circumstance, event or action relating to Buyer or
any of its Affiliates the existence, occurrence or taking of which has
resulted or would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of any of

SECTION 5.15. Release of Claims. Effective as of the Closing, Seller and its
Affiliates (each, a "Releasing Seller Party") hereby releases and absolutely
forever discharges each Company and its directors, officers and employees

director, contractor, consultant or employee of the Companies or otherwise,
arising by virtue of or in any matter related to any actions or inactions with
respect to the Companies or their affairs on or before the Closing Date. It is
the intention of the Releasing Seller Parties that the foregoing release shall
be effective as a full and final accord and satisfaction and general release
of and from all Released 

Company Matters and the final resolution by the Releasing Seller Parties and
the Released Company Parties of all Released Company Matters.

deliver to Buyer a true, complete and correct list of all Investment Assets of
Ozark with information included therein as to the Statutory Book Value and
estimated fair market value of such Investment Assets (except as otherwise

in a manner consistent with the calculations with respect to such assets in
Section 3.26(a)(i) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, in each case, as of the
close of business on a day requested in writing (delivered not less than three
(3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) by Buyer, provided that such day
shall be at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.



SECTION 5.18. Agency Agreements. Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall cause

Agreements to be assigned by Seller to Ozark. In connection with the actions

be fully performed prior to the Closing will survive until the date that is
eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date, after which time no claim for

extent known at such time) and in a written claims notice delivered to the
applicable Indemnitor prior to the expiration of the applicable survival
period set forth in clause (a) or (b) above shall not thereafter be barred by
the expiration of such survival period and such claim shall survive until
finally resolved.



SECTION 7.2. Indemnification.



(a) From and after Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and
its Affiliates, and their respective Representatives and their respective
successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified
Persons") from and against and reimburse each of them for any and all

Seller Fundamental Representation);



(ii) any breach of any representation or warranty of (x) Seller made in
Section 3.11 of this Agreement or any certificate furnished by Seller pursuant

Indemnitees under Section 7.2(a)(i) (in the case of Seller) or Section

all Indemnifiable Losses of the Indemnitees under such Section 7.2(a)(i) or
such Section 7.2(b)(i), as the case may be, exceeds $1,521,291 (the
"Deductible"), at which point such Indemnitor shall only be liable to its
respective Indemnitees for the value of the Indemnitee\'s claims under Section
7.2(a)(i) or such Section 7.2(b)(i), as the case may be, in excess of such
Deductible, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VII. Except
in the case of any Fraud, the maximum aggregate liability of Seller, on the
one hand, and Buyer on the other hand, to their respective Indemnitees for any
and all Indemnifiable Losses under Section 7.2(a)(i), in the case of Seller,
or Section 7.2(b)(i), in the case of Buyer, shall be $20,000,000.



SECTION 7.4. Definitions. As used in this Agreement:



(i) "Indemnitee" means any Person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement;



(ii) "Indemnitor" means any Person required to provide indemnification under
this Agreement;



(iii) "Indemnifiable Losses" means any and all damages, losses, liabilities,
obligations, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses) suffered or incurred by the Indemnitee; provided, that such damages,
losses, 

liabilities, obligations, costs and expenses (x) shall in no event include any
amounts constituting consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive
damages (except to the extent actually paid to a third party in connection
with a Third Party Claim) and (y) shall be net of any (A) amounts actually
recovered (after deducting related reasonable costs and expenses and any
deductibles) by the Indemnitee with respect to such damages, losses,
liabilities, obligations, costs and expenses under any insurance policy,
reinsurance agreement, warranty or indemnity or otherwise from any Person
other than a party hereto, and the Indemnitee shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnitor for any such amount that is received by it from any such other
Person with respect to such damages, losses, liabilities, obligations, costs
and expenses (after deducting related reasonable costs and expenses and any
deductibles) after any indemnification with respect thereto has actually been
paid pursuant to this Agreement, and (B) amounts to the extent expressly
reserved for and included in the calculation of the Ozark Final Closing
Statutory Value or the N.I.S. Final Closing Working Capital; and



(iv) "Third Party Claim" means any claim, action, suit, or proceeding made or
brought by any Person that is not an Indemnitee.



SECTION 7.5. Procedures for Third Party Claims.



(a) If any Indemnitee receives notice of assertion or commencement of any
Third Party Claim against such Indemnitee in respect of which an Indemnitor
may be obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the
Indemnitee shall give such Indemnitor reasonably prompt written notice (but in
no event later than thirty (30) days after becoming aware) thereof and such
notice shall include a reasonable description of the claim and any
documentation of the Third Party Claim and, to the extent identifiable, an
estimate of the Indemnifiable Loss and shall reference the specific sections
of this Agreement that form the basis of such claim; provided, that no delay
on the part of the Indemnitee in notifying any Indemnitor shall relieve the
Indemnitor from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the
extent) the Indemnitor is actually prejudiced by such delay (except that the
Indemnitor shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during the period in
which the Indemnitee failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the Indemnitee
shall deliver to the Indemnitor, promptly after the Indemnitee\'s receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received
by the Indemnitee relating to the Third Party Claim.



(b) Subject to this Section 7.5(b), the Indemnitor will be entitled to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim and, if it so chooses, to
assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnitor that is
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee. Should the Indemnitor so elect to
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor will not as long as
it conducts such defense be liable to the Indemnitee for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof
except as set forth in the next sentence. If the Indemnitor assumes such
defense, the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the defense
thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel
employed by the Indemnitor; provided, that Indemnitee will have the right to
assume the defense and/or receive reimbursement from Indemnitor for the costs
and expense of such separate counsel if (i) Indemnitor and Indemnitee are both
named parties to the proceedings and Indemnitee shall have concluded in good
faith that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them or
the availability to Indemnitee of one or more defenses or counterclaims that
are inconsistent with one or more of those that may be available to Indemnitor
in respect thereof or (ii) Indemnitor fails to diligently pursue a Third Party
Claim it has assumed. The Indemnitor will be liable for the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee for any period during which
the Indemnitor has not assumed the defense thereof (other than during any
period in which the Indemnitee shall have not yet given notice of the Third
Party Claim as provided above). In no event shall the Indemnitee\'s right to
indemnification for a Third Party Claim be adversely affected by its
assumption of the defense of such Third Party Claim. All of the parties shall
reasonably cooperate in the defense of any Third Party Claim. Such cooperation
includes the retention and (upon request) the provision to the other of
reasonably requested records and information that are relevant to such Third
Party Claim, and making employees reasonably available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnitor has assumed the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall not pay, settle,
compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnitor\'s
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). If the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnitor may only pay, settle, compromise or discharge a
Third Party Claim with the Indemnitee\'s prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, that
the Indemnitor may pay, settle, compromise or discharge such a Third Party
Claim without the written consent of the Indemnitee if such settlement (i)
includes a release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such
Third Party Claim, (ii) does not subject the Indemnitee to any injunctive
relief or other equitable remedy, (iii) does not include a statement or
admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of the
Indemnitee and (iv) only involves the payment of monetary damages by the
Indemnitor.



SECTION 7.6. Direct Claims. The Indemnitor will have a period of thirty (30)
days within which to respond in writing to any claim by an Indemnitee on
account of an Indemnifiable Loss that does not result from a Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnitor does not so respond within such 30-day period, the
Indemnitor will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the
Indemnitee may pursue such remedies as are then available to the Indemnitee.



SECTION 7.7. Additional Indemnification Procedures.



(a) In accordance with Applicable Law, an Indemnitee shall take, and shall
cause its Affiliates to take, all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate
any Indemnifiable Losses upon and after becoming aware of any facts, matters,
failures or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in any
Indemnifiable Losses.



(b) To the extent that any amounts are recoverable under any insurance policy,
reinsurance agreement, warranty or indemnity or otherwise from any Person
other than a party hereto that would reduce the amount of Indemnifiable
Losses, Indemnitee will, on a timely and expeditious basis, use commercially
reasonable efforts to effect recovery under such applicable insurance policy,
reinsurance agreement and warranty and otherwise pursue to conclusion
available remedies or causes of action to recover the amount of such claim as
may be available thereunder.



(c) In the event of payment by or on behalf of an Indemnitor to any
Indemnitee in connection with any claim or demand by a Person other than the
parties hereto or their respective Affiliates, such Indemnitor shall be
subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events
or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnitee may have any right,
defense or claim relating to such claim or demand against any claimant or
plaintiff asserting such claim or demand. Any such Indemnitee shall cooperate
with such Indemnitor in a reasonable manner, and at the cost of such
Indemnitor, in presenting any subrogated right, defense or claim.



SECTION 7.8. Release of Escrow Funds. While the specific provisions relating
to distribution and release of the Escrow Fund shall be set forth in the
Escrow Agreement, it is understood and agreed that subject to the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement, on the first Business Day following the
date that is eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date (the "Escrow
Termination Date"), there shall be automatically released from the Escrow Fund
and delivered to the Seller, an amount equal to the following: (i) the amount
of the Escrow Fund remaining in escrow as of the Escrow Termination Date,
minus (ii) the sum of all amounts, if any, that as of the Escrow Termination
Date are required to be retained in the Escrow Fund to secure satisfaction of
then-pending indemnification claims pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.



SECTION 7.9. Sole Remedy. Except as provided under Sections 10.7(b) or 2.5,
except as provided in any other Transaction Agreement, and except in the case
of any Fraud, if the Closing occurs, the parties\' sole and exclusive monetary
remedy following the Closing with respect to any and all claims arising out of
or related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
pursuant to the provisions set forth in this Article VII or Article VIII, as
applicable.

withholding Taxes, such Taxes shall be allocated based on an interim closing
of the books as of the Closing Date; and



(ii) in the case of Taxes calculated on a periodic basis, the portion of such

ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Straddle Period.



SECTION 8.2. Filing of Tax Returns.



(a) (i) Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Consolidated Returns that include Seller and the Companies,
regardless of when such Tax Returns are required to be filed. Seller shall pay

Closing Date (taking into account any extensions) other than Tax Returns
described in Section 8.2(a)(i). Seller shall pay all Taxes with respect to
such Tax Returns within the time and in the manner prescribed by Applicable
Law.



(iii) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Companies to provide
Seller and its Affiliates in a timely fashion in accordance with past practice
all filing information relating to the Companies necessary for the preparation
and filing of the Consolidated Returns.



(b) Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, Tax Returns for the Companies for taxable periods that end on or before
the Closing Date are not described in Section 8.2(a) and for any Straddle
Period. Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with the positions taken, and with accounting methods used, on the Tax Returns
filed by or with respect to the Companies prior to the date on which the
Closing occurs, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law or agreed by
Seller and Buyer. Buyer shall deliver any such Tax Return to Seller for
Seller\'s review at least forty-five (45) days (or, in the case of premium Tax
Returns, ten (10) days) prior to the date such Tax Return is required to be
filed and shall accept all reasonable comments of Seller in respect of such
Tax Returns. To the extent consistent with Applicable Law, Buyer shall, or
shall cause the Companies to, file all Tax Returns for any Straddle Period on
the basis that the relevant Tax period ended as of the Closing Date, unless
the relevant Tax Authority will not accept a Tax Return filed on that basis.
Buyer shall pay all Taxes with respect to all Tax Returns described in this
Section 8.2(b) within the time and in the manner prescribed by Applicable Law,
and Seller shall remit to Buyer within ten (10) days of Buyer\'s demand
therefor Seller\'s allocable share of such Taxes as determined under Section
8.1(a).



(c) Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause the Companies to prepare and
timely file, all Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the
Companies for any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date.



(d) Except to the extent otherwise required by Applicable Law, Buyer shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, without the prior written
consent of Seller, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, amend any Tax Returns of the Companies relating in whole or in
part to a Pre-Closing Tax Period.



SECTION 8.3. Tax Refunds.



(a) Except as described in Section 8.3(b), any Tax refund, credit, or similar
benefit (including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) (a "Tax
Refund") relating to the Companies for Taxes paid for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be the property of Seller except to the extent such Tax Refund
was included as a tax receivable or item included in a tax payable and taken
into account in calculating the Final Adjustment Amount. If received by Buyer
or the Companies, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Companies to, pay such Tax
Refund promptly to Seller. In the event that any such Tax Refund is
subsequently contested by any Tax Authority, such contest shall be handled in
accordance with the procedures in Section 7.5. Any additional Taxes owed
resulting from the contest shall be indemnified in accordance with Section
8.1.



(b) Notwithstanding Section 8.3(a), any Tax Refund received by the Companies
or Seller (or any member of the Seller Group), to the extent such Tax Refund
was taken into account in calculating the Final Adjustment Amount, will be the
property of Buyer. If received by Seller (or any member of the Seller Group),
Seller shall, or shall cause such member to, pay such Tax Refund promptly to
Buyer. In the event that any such Tax Refund is subsequently contested by any
Tax Authority, the parties shall handle such contest in accordance with the
procedures in Section 7.5. Any additional Taxes owed resulting from the
contest shall be indemnified in accordance with Section 8.1.



SECTION 8.4. Conveyance Taxes. Buyer or Seller, as appropriate, shall execute
and deliver all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the other to
comply with any filing requirements relating to any sales, use, transfer,
value added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording,
registration and other fees and any similar Taxes ("Conveyance Taxes") which
become payable in connection with the purchase of Shares by Buyer or the
consummation of any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and shall file such applications and documents as shall permit any Conveyance
Taxes to be assessed and paid. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to timely
prepare all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all
such Conveyance Taxes, including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the
application or imposition of any Conveyance Taxes. Each party shall file any
Tax Returns required to be filed by it under applicable Law in connection with
such Conveyance Taxes. Any Conveyance Taxes incurred in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
shared equally between Seller and Buyer, and the party not responsible for
filing a Tax Return with respect to such Conveyance Taxes shall remit fifty
percent (50%) of the Taxes shown on such Tax Return, payable to the
appropriate taxing authority, within ten (10) days of demand therefor from the
filing party.



SECTION 8.5. Tax Audits and Cooperation.



(a) Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall notify such other party within
fifteen (15) days after receipt by such first party or any of its Affiliates
of written notice of any pending federal, state, local, or foreign Tax audit
or examination or notice of deficiency or other adjustment, assessment or
redetermination relating to Taxes ("Tax Matters") for which such other party
or its Affiliates may be responsible under Section 8.1.



(b) Seller shall have the sole right to control, contest, resolve and defend
against any Tax Matters relating to Taxes of either Company for which Seller
is obligated to indemnify Buyer under Section 8.1; provided, that Seller shall
keep Buyer reasonably informed on an ongoing basis with respect to issues
affecting either Company and; also provided, that Seller shall not pay,
discharge, settle compromise, litigate, or otherwise dispose (collectively,
"dispose") of any item subject to such Tax proceedings with respect to any
Taxes that will adversely affect Buyer or any of its Affiliates without
obtaining the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Seller may elect to forgo
control of any Tax proceeding that it is entitled to control pursuant to this
Section 8.5(b), and shall notify Buyer if Seller elects to forgo such control.
In that event (i) Buyer shall control the conduct of such Tax proceeding, but
shall afford Seller and its Tax advisors a reasonable opportunity to
participate (at Seller\'s expense) in the conduct of such Tax proceeding,
including, without limitation, the right to participate in conferences with
all Tax Authorities and submit pertinent material in support of the Seller\'s
position and (ii) Seller shall be responsible for any reasonable fees and
other out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable outside professional fees and
costs) incurred in contesting any Tax proceeding.



(c) Seller and Buyer shall provide each other with such cooperation and
information as either of them or their respective Affiliates may reasonably
request of the other in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for
Tax Refund, or other Tax Matter. Such cooperation and information shall
include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together
with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating to
rulings or other determinations by Tax Authorities. Each party shall and shall
cause its Affiliates to make its employees available on a basis mutually
convenient to both parties to provide explanation of any documents or
information provided hereunder. Each of Seller and Buyer shall retain all Tax
Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its
possession related to Tax Matters for the first Post-Closing Tax Period and
for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the Tax period to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent notified
in writing of such extensions for the respective Tax periods, or (ii) three
years following the due date (without extensions) for such Tax Returns. The
parties shall keep any information obtained under this Section 8.5(c)
confidential except as otherwise may be necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or claims for Tax Refunds or in conducting an audit or
as otherwise may be required by Applicable Law or the rules of any stock
exchange.



SECTION 8.6. Miscellaneous.



(a) Seller and Buyer agree to treat all payments (other than interest on a
payment) made by either of them to or for the benefit of the other or the
other\'s Affiliates or the Companies under this Article VIII and under other
indemnity provisions of this Agreement as adjustments to the Purchase Price
for Tax purposes to the extent permissible under Applicable Law.



(b) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
representations and warranties of Seller in Section 3.12 and the obligations
of Seller to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Persons and of
Buyer to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Persons pursuant
to this Article VIII shall terminate on the later of the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (taking into account any applicable
extensions or tollings thereof) with respect to the Taxes or Tax liabilities
in question or sixty (60) days after the final administrative or judicial
determination of such Taxes or Tax liabilities, except for any indemnity
obligations as to which a claim has been made before the expiration of the
applicable period.



(c) At Buyer\'s option, Seller and Buyer shall timely make or shall cause the
appropriate persons to timely make, joint elections (collectively, the
"Section 338(h)(10) Elections") with respect to the purchase of the stock of
the Companies under (i) Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and (ii) any analogous
election with respect to state, local, or foreign income Taxes, to the extent
that such election is separately available, in each state, local, and foreign
jurisdiction where the Companies currently file income Tax Returns. If the
Section 338(h)(10) Elections are made, (I) Seller and Buyer shall report (or
shall cause an appropriate person to report), in connection with the
determination of Taxes, the purchase of the stock of the Companies in a manner
consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Elections and the Agreed Allocation (as
defined in Section 8.6(d)) and (II) each of Seller and Buyer shall file (and
cause their respective Affiliates to file) all Tax Returns (including the
Section 338(h)(10) Election forms and any statements, forms, and schedules in
connection therewith in a manner consistent with the Agreed Allocation,
unless, and then only to the extent, required to do so pursuant to a
determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code (and any comparable
provisions of state, local or foreign Tax law).



(d) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event later than
150 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a written
notice setting forth (with reasonable specificity) (i) Buyer\'s good faith
calculation of the aggregate deemed sales price ("ADSP") and the allocation
thereof between the Companies and among the assets of the Companies in
accordance with the principles of the applicable Treasury Regulations
("Buyer\'s Allocation"). Within 30 days after receipt thereto, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer written notice indicating whether Seller disagrees with the
Buyer\'s Allocation. If the Seller agrees with the Buyer\'s Allocation or if
the Seller fails to deliver such written notice within such 30 days, the
Buyer\'s Allocation shall constitute the agreed upon allocation (the "Agreed
Allocation"). If Seller provides timely written notice to Buyer of any
disagreement with the Buyer\'s Allocation, the parties shall negotiate in good
faith to determine the Agreed Allocation. If they do not reach agreement
within 30 days after commencing negotiations, the parties shall submit the
items in dispute to a mutually agreed upon nationally recognized accounting
firm to resolve the dispute in a manner utilizing substantially the same
dispute resolution protocols and procedures as are described in Section
2.5(c)(v) through (vii) herein. The accountant\'s determination shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the parties and shall be treated as the
Agreed Allocation. Any expenses related to the engagement of the accountant
shall be shared equally by the parties.



(e) Except as otherwise provided in or contemplated by the Transition Services
Agreement, all Tax Sharing Agreements between either Company, on the one hand,
and the Seller or an Affiliate of Seller, on the other hand, shall be amended
or terminated as of the Closing Date, such that, after the Closing Date,
neither Company shall be bound thereby or have any obligation or liability
thereunder; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt, this Section 8.6 shall
not apply to the obligations of the Buyer or the Seller under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, as soon as is practicable after the Closing
Date, each Company shall make a calculation under any Tax Sharing Agreement of
its allocation of consolidated income taxes for the taxable year that ends on
the Closing Date. For purposes of this calculation, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in any Tax Sharing Agreement, items of income, gain, loss,
deduction, expense, and credits of each Company shall be determined on the
basis of an interim closing of the books for the Pre-Closing Tax Period. To
the extent either Company has a liability under any Tax Sharing Agreement,
such Company shall make a final payment under the Tax Sharing Agreement equal
to the amount so determined. To the extent a Company is entitled to payment
under any Tax Sharing Agreement, the Seller shall make, or shall cause to be
made, a final payment to such Company equal to the amount so determined. Such
amounts shall be payable as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing
Date.



ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION PRIOR TO CLOSING



SECTION 9.1. Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing:



(a) by Seller or Buyer in writing, if there shall be any order, injunction or
decree of any Governmental Entity that prohibits or restrains any party from
consummating the transactions contemplated hereby, and such order, injunction
or decree shall have become final and non-appealable, unless the fact that
such order, injunction or decree has become final and non-appealable has been
principally caused by a material breach of this Agreement by the party seeking
to terminate this Agreement;



(b) by Seller or Buyer in writing, if the Closing has not occurred on or prior
to March 31, 2019 (as it may be extended, the "Outside Date"), unless the
failure of the Closing to occur has been principally caused by a material
breach of this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement;



(c) by either Seller or Buyer (but only so long as Seller or Buyer, as
applicable, is not in material breach under this Agreement) in writing, if a
breach of any provision of this Agreement that has been committed by the other
party would cause the failure of any mutual condition to Closing or any
condition to Closing for the benefit of the non-breaching party and such
breach is not capable of being cured by the Outside Date or is not cured
within twenty (20) calendar days after the breaching party receives written
notice from the non-breaching party that the non-breaching party intends to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c); or



(d) by mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer.



SECTION 9.2. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further
force and effect without liability of either party (or any Representative of
such party) to the other party to this Agreement; provided, that no such
termination shall relieve a party from liability for any material breach of
this Agreement occurring prior to such termination. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Section 1.1, Section 5.5, this Section 9.2 and Article X shall
survive termination hereof pursuant to Section 9.1.



ARTICLE X

GENERAL PROVISIONS



SECTION 10.1. Fees and Expenses. Except for any reimbursement of Transaction
Expenses that may be awarded as damages in any action, suit or proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or the other Transaction Agreements, each party
shall, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or the other Transaction
Agreements, pay its own Transaction Expenses incident to preparing for,
entering into and carrying out the Transaction Agreements and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated thereby including, in the case of Buyer, any
broker\'s or similar fees and other commissions to Merger and Acquisition
Capital Services, LLC.

SECTION 10.3. Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, Exhibit, Annex or Schedule, such reference is to a Section of, or an
Exhibit, Annex or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Any
fact or item disclosed in any section of each of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule
and Seller Disclosure Schedule is deemed disclosed in all other sections of
such Disclosure Schedule to the extent the applicability of such fact or item
to such other section of such Disclosure Schedule is reasonably apparent.
Disclosure of any item in the Buyer Disclosure Schedule or the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, is not deemed an admission that such
item represents a material item, fact, exception of fact, event or
circumstance or that the occurrence or non-occurrence of any change or effect
related to such item would have, or would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect. From time to time
prior to the Closing, each of Buyer and Seller shall have the right (but not
the obligation) to supplement or amend its Disclosure Schedule with respect to
any matter hereafter arising or of which it becomes aware after the date
hereof (each a "Schedule Supplement"); provided that any disclosure in any
such Schedule Supplement shall be for informational purposes only and shall
not be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement, including for purposes of the
indemnification or termination rights contained in this Agreement or of
determining whether or not the conditions set forth in Article VI have been
satisfied. The table of contents, articles, titles and headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only and do not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they are deemed to be
followed by the words "without limitation." Whenever the singular is used
herein, the same includes the plural, and whenever the plural is used herein,
the same includes the singular, where appropriate. Whenever the word "Dollars"
or the "$" sign appears in this Agreement, they mean United States Dollars,
and all transactions under this Agreement are in United States Dollars. This
Agreement has been fully negotiated by the parties hereto and may not be
construed by any Governmental Entity against either party by virtue of the
fact that such party was the drafting party.



SECTION 10.4. Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
(including all exhibits, annexes and schedules hereto), the Confidentiality
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, representations
and warranties, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. Except as set forth in Articles VII and VIII
with respect to the Buyer Indemnified Persons and the Seller Indemnified
Persons, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended or may be
construed to confer upon any Person other than the parties any right, remedy
or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.



SECTION 10.5. Governing Law. This Agreement and any dispute arising hereunder
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof, govern this Agreement, the
other Transaction Agreements and any disputes arising hereunder or thereunder.



SECTION 10.6. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned, delegated or
otherwise transferred in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise
(other than following the Closing by operation of law in a merger), by either
party without the prior written consent of the other party, and any such
assignment that is not consented to shall be null and void; provided, that
without the consent of Seller, Buyer may transfer or assign, in whole or from
time to time in part, to NWLG, the rights to purchase N.I.S., provided that no
such transfer or assignment will relieve the Buyer of its obligations
hereunder, including any payment obligations. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.



SECTION 10.7. Jurisdiction; Enforcement.



(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of the United States or any state
court, which in either case is located in the State of Delaware (each, a
"Delaware Court") for purposes of enforcing this Agreement or determining any
claim arising from or related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In any such action, suit or other proceeding, each of the parties
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to assert by way of
motion, as a defense or otherwise any claim that it is not subject to the
jurisdiction of any such Delaware Court, that such action, suit or other
proceeding is not subject to the jurisdiction of any such Delaware Court, that
such action, suit or other proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or
that the venue of such action, suit or other proceeding is improper; provided,
that nothing set forth in this sentence shall prohibit any of the parties
hereto from removing any matter from one Delaware Court to another Delaware
Court. Any final and unappealable judgment against a party in connection with
any action, suit or other proceeding will be conclusive and binding on such
party and that such award or judgment may be enforced in any court of
competent jurisdiction, either within or outside of the United States. A
certified or exemplified copy of such award or judgment will be conclusive
evidence of the fact and amount of such award or judgment. Any process or
other paper to be served in connection with any action or proceeding under
this Agreement shall, if delivered or sent in accordance with Section 10.2,
constitute good, proper and sufficient service thereof.



(b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Without the necessity of
posting bond or other undertaking, the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this Agreement, this being in addition (subject to the terms of this
Agreement) to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in
equity. In the event that any Action is brought in equity to enforce the
provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege, and each party hereby
waives any defense or counterclaim, that there is an adequate remedy at law.



(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OR ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
10.7.



SECTION 10.8. Severability; Amendment; Modification; Waiver.



(a) Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under Applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under
any Applicable Law in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability will not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be reformed, construed
and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision or portion of any provision had never been contained herein. This
Agreement may be amended or a provision hereof waived only by a written
instrument signed by each of Buyer and Seller.



(b) No delay on the part of any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on
the part of any party of any right, power or privilege, nor any single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or privilege.



SECTION 10.9. Certain Limitations.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the other
Transaction Agreements, the Seller Disclosure Schedule or any of the
Schedules, Annexes or Exhibits hereto or thereto, Buyer acknowledges and
agrees that neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including the
Companies), nor any other Person, makes or has made, and Buyer has not relied
on, any representation or warranty or covenant to Buyer, oral or written,
express or implied, other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement, any
certificate delivered by Seller pursuant to this Agreement or contained in any
of the other Transaction Agreements. Buyer further acknowledges that it has
conducted its own independent investigation of the operations and business of
the Companies.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
other Transaction Agreements, the Buyer Disclosure Schedule or any of the
Schedules, Annexes or Exhibits hereto or thereto, Seller acknowledges and
agrees that neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates, nor any other Person,
makes or has made, and Seller has not relied on, any representation or
warranty to Seller, oral or written, express or implied, other than as
expressly set forth in Article IV or any certificate delivered by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement.



SECTION 10.10. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and will become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and
delivered to the other parties. Each party may deliver its signed counterpart
of this Agreement to the other parties by means of electronic mail or any
other electronic medium utilizing image scan technology, and such delivery
will have the same legal effect as hand delivery of an originally executed
counterpart.



SECTION 10.11. No Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
any claim or cause of action arising out of this Agreement may only be brought
against, the Persons who are identified herein as parties hereto, in each case
solely to the extent of each such Person\'s express obligations hereunder and
no former, current or future Affiliate of such Person or of any of the parties
hereto, and no former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent,
representative or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing (collectively, the
"Related Parties") shall have any liability solely as a result of holding such
position or relationship, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by
any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or
other Applicable Law, for any obligations or liabilities of a party hereto for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement, document or instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith, and no
party hereto and their respective Affiliates shall have any rights of recovery
in respect hereof against any Related Party and no personal liability shall
attach to any Related Party, whether by or through attempted piercing of the
corporate veil, by the enforcement of any judgment, fine or penalty or by
virtue of any statute, regulation or other Applicable Law, or otherwise.
