Stockholders Meeting or (b) to the extent that the Company has reasonably
determined, after consultation with outside legal counsel and Parent (and its
outside counsel), that such postponement, recess or adjournment (not to
exceed five Business Days or such longer period as the parties may agree) is
necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement
required by applicable Law with respect to any event, circumstance, discovery
of information or other set of facts first arising after the date of this
Amendment (other than the proxy supplement referred to in Section 10 below) is
provided to the Companys stockholders in advance of the Company Stockholders
