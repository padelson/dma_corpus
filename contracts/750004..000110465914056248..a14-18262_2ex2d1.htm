resignation or removal.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock held
by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect
thereof.

 



 

(b) _Conversion of Certain Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common
Stock held by any Subsidiary of the Company, or by Parent or Merger Sub or any
of their wholly owned Subsidiaries, in each case, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be converted into and become one (1) fully paid share of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of All Other Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than shares canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ or converted pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_ and the shares of Company Restricted Stock (which are
addressed in _Section 3.3_)) shall be converted into the right to receive
$83.30 in cash (the " **Merger Consideration** "), without interest. For
purposes of this Agreement, " **Total Common Merger Consideration** " shall
mean the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding (other than shares canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ or
converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_ and the shares of Company Restricted
Stock (which are addressed in _Section 3.3_)) immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (y) the Merger Consideration. Each share of Company Common
Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in the first sentence of this _Section 3.1(c)_ shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
certificates (the " **Certificates** ") or book-entry shares (" **Book-Entry
Shares** ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with
_Section 3.4_) or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_, the
Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, for each such share of Company
Common Stock held by them. Pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)(ii),_ holders of Book-
Entry Shares shall have the right to receive, in accordance with _Section
3.2_, the Merger Consideration without any requirement to deliver the
Certificates or a letter of transmittal.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, par

Corporation.

 



 

(e) _Equitable Adjustment_. If, at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable into or exercisable such capital stock of the Company, shall
occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a
record date during such period, merger or other similar transaction, the
Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent item shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change to provide the holders
of shares of capital stock of the Company the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , _however_
that nothing in this _Section 3.1(e)_ shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement or to prevent Parent or Merger Sub from
exercising any remedies that may be available to them as a result of any such
change.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company, the identity
and the terms of appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the " **Paying Agent** "), it being agreed by the parties that
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC is acceptable, for the payment of
the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(c)_. Substantially
concurrently with the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of
State, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent,
for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than holders of shares to be
canceled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ or converted pursuant to _Section
3.1(b)_ and the shares of Company Restricted Stock (which are addressed in
_Section 3.3_)) cash constituting an amount equal to the Total Common Merger
Consideration (such Total Common Merger Consideration as deposited with the
Paying Agent, the " **Exchange Fund** "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall
be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 3.1(c)_, Parent
shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the
Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such payment. Nothing contained in this Section 3.2 and no
investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the
Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration. Parent shall cause the
Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of Company Common
Stock that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_ and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments
pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_. Except as provided in _Section 3.2(d)_ or
_Section 3.2(f)_, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 3.1_.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the second (2nd) Business Day thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation shall

 



      
 

 



 

cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by hand)
to each holder of record of a Certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock that
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.1(c)_ (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates, as
applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and which shall be in
the form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, the form and
substance of which letter of transmittal and instruction shall be
substantially as reasonably agreed by the Company and Parent and prepared
prior to Merger Closing.

 



 

(c) _Surrender Procedures_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. Following the Effective Time, upon surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation to the
Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor and Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to pay in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable,
the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_,
and the Certificates surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment of the appropriate amount of Merger
Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer (and accompanied
by all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent) and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay, or cause to be paid, any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this _Section 3.2(c)_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to
_Section 3.1(c)_. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable
upon surrender of any Certificate.

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent
to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to this _Article III_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record of one
or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall automatically upon
the Effective Time (or, at any later time at which such Book-Entry Shares
shall be so converted) be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry Share, the Merger Consideration. No

 



      
 

 



 

interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any
Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains unclaimed by the applicable former stockholders of the Company one
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with
this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claims for Merger Consideration in respect
thereof.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash held in the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which any
Merger Consideration in respect thereof would otherwise escheat to or become
the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, and any holder of such
Certificate who has not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ with
respect thereto shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of its claim for Merger Consideration in respect thereof (if any).

 



 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (i) no such investment shall
relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article III_, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Company
Common Stock in the amount of such losses, (ii) no such investment shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement, and (iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of
the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days
or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America. Any interest or income produced by
such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
directed by Parent.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Equity Awards; Warrants and Employee Stock Purchase Plan_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Options; Restricted Stock; Performance Units; Restricted
Stock Units_.

 



 

(i) _Company Options_. Effective as of five (5) Business Days prior to, and
conditional upon the occurrence of, the Effective Time, each holder of a
Company Option intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" within the
meaning of Section 422 of the Code (an " **Incentive Stock Option** ") granted
prior to the date hereof (or promised to be granted pursuant to Contracts or
offer letters entered into prior to the date hereof by which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is party or bound and which are described on Section
6.1(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter) and that is then outstanding and
unexercised (whether vested or unvested), shall be entitled to exercise

 



      
 

 



 

such Incentive Stock Option in full by providing the Company with the notice
of exercise and full payment of the applicable exercise price (including
through the withholding of shares of Company Common Stock otherwise issuable
upon exercise of such Incentive Stock Option) in accordance with the terms of
the applicable Incentive Stock Option. As of the Effective Time, each
Incentive Stock Option that is not exercised in accordance with the prior
sentence, and each other Company Option granted prior to the date hereof and
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time
(whether vested or unvested), shall be canceled without any action on the part
of any holder of such Company Option in consideration for the right at the
Effective Time to receive in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder
with respect thereto, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, the Option Cash Payment. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall take the actions necessary to effectuate this _Section
3.3(a)(i)_. For purposes of this Agreement, " **Option Cash Payment** " means,
with respect to any Company Option, a cash payment equal to the product of (A)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price payable per share of Company Common Stock issuable under such Company
Option, without interest and less any required withholding Taxes. For the
avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price per share of any Company Option,
whether vested or unvested as of the Effective Time, is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration, then by virtue of the occurrence of the
Effective Time and without any action on the part of the Parent, the Company
or the holder thereof, the Company Option will be canceled without payment of
any consideration to the holder.

 



 

(ii) _Company Performance Units_. Except as provided in Section 6.1(e) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, as of the Effective Time, each equity-based unit
granted prior to the date hereof (or promised to be granted pursuant to
Contracts or offer letters entered into prior to the date hereof by which the
Company of any of its Subsidiaries is party or bound and which are described
on Section 6.1(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter) and that is subject to
performance-based conditions (each a " **Performance Unit** ") pursuant to any
Company Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled without any action on the part
of any holder of any Performance Unit in consideration for the right at the
Effective Time to receive in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder
with respect thereto, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, the Performance Unit Payment. The " **Performance Unit
Payment** " means, with respect to any Performance Unit, a cash payment equal
to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Performance Unit (assuming achievement of the applicable performance-
based conditions at the maximum level) and (B) the Merger Consideration,
without interest and less any required withholding Taxes.

 



 

(iii) _Company Restricted Stock; Company Restricted Stock Units_. Except as
provided in _Section 6.1(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, each share of
Company Restricted Stock and Company Restricted Stock Unit granted prior to
the date hereof (or promised to be granted pursuant to Contracts or offer
letters entered into prior to the date hereof by which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is party or

 



      
 

 



 

bound and which are described on Section 6.1(e) of the Company Disclosure
Letter) pursuant to any Company Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled in full and
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive in consideration for such
cancellation and in full satisfaction of the rights of such holder with
respect thereto, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time (except as otherwise provided in Section 3.3(a)(iv)), a cash payment
equal to the Merger Consideration, without interest and less any required
withholding Taxes (the " **Restricted Award Payment** ").

 



 

(iv) _Manner of Making Payment_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Surviving Corporation
sufficient cash funds to make all Option Cash Payments, all Restricted Award
Payments and all Performance Unit Payments, in each case, subject to and as
required pursuant to this _Section 3.3(a)_ and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to make such payments to all holders of Company Options, Company
Restricted Stock Units, shares of Company Restricted Stock and Performance
Units, as applicable, as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time,
and in any event, within five (5) Business Days thereafter or, if later, on
the earlier of any special payroll date elected by the Surviving Corporation
and the first payroll date of the Surviving Corporation that occurs after the
Merger Closing Date; provided that to the extent payment within such time or
on such date would trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code,
such payments shall be made on the earliest date that payment would not
trigger such tax or penalty.

 



 

(v) With respect to Company Options, Performance Units, shares of Company
Restricted Stock and Company Restricted Stock Units granted, in each case,
from and after the date of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 6.1(e)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter, at the Effective Time, the Merger shall have
the effects set forth in _Section 6.1(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate actions such that (i) the
offering period in effect on the date hereof under the ESPP ends no later than
the tenth (10th) day preceding the Effective Time (the " **Final Purchase
Date** "), (ii) no new purchase or offering period under the ESPP commences on
or following the date hereof, (iii) participation in the offering period in
effect on the date hereof shall be limited to those eligible employees who are
participants on the date of this Agreement (and the Company shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable, ensure that such participants may not increase their
payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement), and (iv) as of the Effective Time, the
ESPP shall terminate. The Company shall (if necessary) notify each participant
in writing, at least ten (10) days prior to the Final Purchase Date, that the
then-current purchase date for the participants option under the ESPP has
been changed to the Final Purchase Date and that the participants option
shall be exercised automatically on the Final Purchase Date, unless prior to
such date the participant withdraws from the then-current offering period. On
the Final Purchase Date, the Company shall apply all funds credited as of such
date under such ESPP within each participants payroll withholding account to
the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of such ESPP.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) _Certain Actions_. Prior to the Merger Closing Date, the Company shall
take commercially reasonable actions to (i) effectuate the provisions of
_Section 3.3(a),_ (ii) terminate all of the Company Plans, other than the 2010
Long Term Incentive Plan, as of the Effective Time, and (iii) ensure that any
options, other equity-based awards or other rights granted or issued by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof (or promised to be
granted pursuant to Contracts or offer letters entered into prior to the date
hereof by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is party or bound) that
may entitle any Person to own any capital stock of or other equity interests
in Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries prior of the
date hereof or to receive any payment or other consideration in respect of the
foregoing shall be canceled immediately prior to the Effective Time without
any payment therefor (except for the cash payments expressly contemplated by
this _Section 3.3_ ); it being understood that the intention of the parties is
that immediately following the Effective Time no holder of any Company Option,
Company Restricted Stock Unit, share of Company Restricted Stock, Performance
Unit or any participant in any Company Plan, other than the 2010 Long Term
Incentive Plan, or other employee benefit arrangement of the Company shall
have any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock (including any
"phantom" stock, stock appreciation rights or other equity interest) of
Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries pursuant to such Company Plan, other arrangement or otherwise,
other than any rights to acquire capital stock of Parent following the
Effective Time in respect of awards granted after the date hereof in
accordance with _Section 6.1(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Parent of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such customary
and reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this _Article III_.

 



 

Section 3.5 _Withholdings_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration, the Option Cash Payment, the Performance Unit Payment and the
Restricted Award Payment, as applicable, and any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock, Company
Options, shares of Company Restricted Stock, Performance Units or Company
Restricted Stock Units, such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of applicable Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation of shares of

 



      
 

 



 

Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for
transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery
of the applicable Merger Consideration, as provided for in _Section 3.1(c)_ ,
for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_**

 



 

Except as (i) and to the extent disclosed in any form, report, schedule,
statement or other document (including all amendments thereto) filed with, or
furnished to, the SEC by the Company or SHFL entertainment, Inc., in each
case, since July 1, 2012 and publicly available prior to the date hereof (but
excluding any forward-looking disclosures set forth in any risk factor
section, any disclosure in any section relating to forward-looking statements,
any other disclosures included in any such form, report, schedule, statement
or other document to the extent they are predictive or forward-looking in
nature); _provided_ that in no event shall any disclosure in any such form,
report, schedule, statement or other document qualify or limit the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Sections 4.2_ ,
_4.3_ , _4.23_ , _4.24_ , _4.25_ or _4.26_ , or (ii) disclosed in the
corresponding section of the Company Disclosure Letter (it being understood
that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the representation
and warranty set forth in this Agreement to which it corresponds in number
and, whether or not an explicit reference or cross-reference is made, each
other representation and warranty set forth in this _Article IV_ for which it
is reasonably apparent on its face that such information is relevant to such
other representation and warranty), the Company hereby represents and warrants
to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation or legal entity duly organized
or formed, validly existing and (to the extent applicable) in good standing,
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization or formation and has the
requisite corporate or similar entity power and authority to conduct its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be (to the
extent applicable) in good standing or to have such power and authority would
not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign entity to do business,
and (to the extent applicable) is in good standing, in each jurisdiction in
which the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except
where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in good standing
would not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The copies of the Restated Articles of Incorporation of the
Company, as amended to date (the " **Charter** ") and Second Amended and
Restated Bylaws of the Company, as amended to date (the " **Bylaws** "), in
each case, as most recently filed with the Company SEC Documents, are, in each
case, true, complete and correct copies of such documents.

 



 

Section 4.2 _Capitalization; Subsidiaries_. (a) As of the date hereof, the
authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 100,000,000 shares of
Company Common

 



      
 

 



 

Stock and 10,000,000 shares of the Companys special stock, par value $0.10
per share (the " **Special Stock** "). As of July 29, 2014, (i) 38,323,704
shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding (including 546,218
shares of Company Restricted Stock), (ii) no shares of Special Stock were
issued and outstanding, and (iii) 27,800,315 shares of Company Common Stock
were held in treasury. As of July 29, 2014, there were (x) 425,644 shares of
Company Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the ESPP, and (y)
3,551,575 shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance under Company
Plans (including, as of July 29, 2014, outstanding Company Options to purchase
701,279 shares of Company Common Stock, 42,137 shares subject to outstanding
Company Restricted Stock Units, and 119,688 shares subject to outstanding
Performance Units (assuming achievement of applicable performance-based
conditions at the maximum level)). Except as set forth above, as of July 29,
2014, no shares of capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in,
the Company, or options, warrants or other rights to acquire any such stock or
securities were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. All outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all shares that may be issued
pursuant to the ESPP and the Company Plans will be, when issued in accordance
with the terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable and not subject to preemptive rights. _Section 4.2(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date hereof, with respect to
each Company Option, share of Company Restricted Stock, Company Restricted
Stock Unit, Performance Unit or other equity-based award outstanding under any
Company Plan, the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable or amount
payable thereunder (assuming achievement of applicable performance-based
conditions at the maximum level), the expiration date and exercise or
conversion price relating thereto, and, with respect to each Performance Unit,
the applicable performance targets. The per share exercise price or purchase
price for each Company Option was equal to or greater than the fair market
value of the underlying shares of Company Common Stock determined as
prescribed by the applicable Company Plan on the effective date of the
corporate action effectuating the grant of such Company Option.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in _Section 4.2(a)_ and except as expressly permitted
under _Section 6.1_ , there are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, convertible securities or other similar rights, agreements,
commitments or Contracts of any kind to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, shares of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, or securities convertible into, or
exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of capital stock of, or other equity
or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any other
equity or equity based awards, whether settled in cash or other property, or
obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or
enter into any such security, option, warrant, call, right or contract. Except
as set forth in _Section 4.2(a)_ , there are no obligations, commitments or
arrangements, contingent or otherwise, of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire shares of capital stock
of, or other equity or voting interests in, or securities convertible into, or
exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of capital stock of, or other equity
or voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. There are no
voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of capital stock
of or equity interests in the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Except as would not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, all the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company are legally and beneficially
owned by the Company or one or more wholly owned Subsidiaries of the Company,
free and clear of all Liens.

 



 

(d) As of the date hereof, the aggregate principal balance of the Company and
its Subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement, plus any other indebtedness for

_Article V_ for which it is reasonably apparent on its face that such
information is relevant to such other representation and warranty), Parent and
Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company

Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to do business, and (to the extent applicable) is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed or to be in good standing would not constitute,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. True and
correct copies of the organizational or governing documents of Parent and
Merger Sub (the " **Parent Organizational Documents** ") have previously been
provided to the Company.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Authority Relative to Agreement_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub

Organizational Documents, (ii) assuming all Gaming Approvals have been
obtained or made and the waiting periods referred to therein have expired, and
any condition precedent to such consent, approval, authorization, or waiver
has been satisfied, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent or
Merger Sub or by which any property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub is bound
or affected or (iii) result in any breach of, or constitute a default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)
under, or give to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien (other than, in the case
of the Debt Financing, any Lien required or permitted thereunder) on any of
the properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture or credit agreement, or any other Contract or other
instrument or obligation to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which
Parent or Merger Sub or any property or asset of Parent or Merger Sub is
bound, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such

cancellation that would not constitute, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger
Sub, the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Debt Financing,

to, any Governmental Authority, except for (i) the filing with the SEC of such
reports under the Exchange Act as may be required in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) compliance

obtained under applicable Gaming Laws (including with respect to the lottery-
related activities of Parent and its Subsidiaries), (v) any filings required
under the rules of Nasdaq, and (vi) such other consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, filings or notifications, the failure of which to
have, make or obtain, as applicable, would not constitute, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

is no Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing
against either Parent or Merger Sub as would constitute, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

terms of this Agreement), and any definitive agreements with respect to the
Debt Financing (which definitive agreements, whether entered into before or
after the date of this Agreement (but if entered into after the date hereof,

full force and effect and are, or in the case of Financing Agreements entered
into after the date of this Agreement will be, legal, valid and binding
obligations of Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto, enforceable against Parent (and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the
other parties thereto) in accordance with their respective terms (except as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights, and to general
equitable principles). As of the date of this Agreement, no Debt Commitment
Letter or Financing Agreement has been withdrawn, terminated, repudiated,
rescinded, amended, supplemented or modified, in any respect, and no such
withdrawal, termination, repudiation, rescission, amendment, supplement or
modification is contemplated. Parent has delivered to the Company an accurate
and complete copy of each Financing Agreement, if any, entered into on or
prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, (i) neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor,
to the Knowledge of Parent, any other counterparty thereto is in breach of any
of its covenants or other obligations set forth in, or is in default under,
any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements, and (ii) to
Parents Knowledge, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 7.2(a)_ , _7.2(b)_ and _7.2(c)_ , no event has occurred or
circumstance exists that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
or would reasonably be expected to (A) constitute or result in a breach or
default on the part of any Person under any of the Debt Commitment Letters or
Financing Agreements, (B) constitute or result in a failure to satisfy a
condition precedent or other contingency set forth in any of the Debt
Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements, (C) make any of the assumptions or
any of the statements set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters inaccurate in
any material respect or (D) otherwise result in any portion of the Debt
Financing not being available. As of the date of this Agreement, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub has received any notice or other communication from any
party to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements with
respect to

 



      
 

 



 

(i) any actual or potential breach or default on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub or any other party to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing
Agreements, or (ii) any intention of such party to terminate any of the Debt
Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements or to not provide all or any
portion of the Debt Financing. Parent and Merger Sub (both before and after
giving effect to any "market flex" provisions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letters and Financing Agreements): (x) have no reason to believe that,
assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.2(a)_ ,
_7.2(b)_ and _7.2(c)_ , they will not be able to satisfy on a timely basis
each term and condition relating to the closing or funding of the Debt
Financing; and (y) know of no fact, occurrence, circumstance or condition
that, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections
7.2(a)_ , _7.2(b)_ and _7.2(c)_ ,would reasonably be expected to (1) cause
any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements to terminate, to be
withdrawn, modified, repudiated or rescinded or to be or become ineffective,
except in accordance with its terms or (2) otherwise cause the full amount (or
any portion) of the funds contemplated to be available under the Debt
Commitment Letters to not be available to Parent and Merger Sub on a timely
basis (and in any event as of the Merger Closing). Parent and/or Merger Sub
have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees or deposits required
by the Debt Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the date of this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Sections 7.2(a)_
, _7.2(b)_ and _7.2(c)_ , the aggregate proceeds from the Debt Financing
constitute all of the financing required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are sufficient in amount to
provide Parent and Merger Sub with the funds necessary for Parent and Merger
Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to satisfy their
respective obligations under this Agreement, including for Parent and Merger
Sub to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, the aggregate Option Cash
Payments, the aggregate Restricted Award Payments, the aggregate Performance
Unit Payments, and the aggregate amount of any repayment or refinancing of
debt contemplated by this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letters (including
as contemplated by _Section 6.16_) and the payment of all fees, costs and
expenses to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation related
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including such fees and
expenses relating to the Debt Financing (such amounts, collectively, the "
**Required Payment Amount** ").

 



 

(e) There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies to the obligation
of any party to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements to
fund the full amount (or any portion) of the Debt Financing, or that would
reasonably be expected to reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing,
including any condition or other contingency relating to the availability of
any "market flex" provisions, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters as in effect on the date hereof (the " **Disclosed
Conditions** "). Other than the Disclosed Conditions, no Financing Source or
other Person has any right to impose, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any Subsidiary obligor have any obligation to accept, any condition
precedent to any funding of the Debt Financing nor any reduction to the
aggregate amount available under the Debt Commitment Letters (nor any term or
condition which would have the effect of reducing the aggregate amount
available under the Debt Commitment Letters), except in accordance with their
respective terms. There are no side letters and (except for the Debt
Commitment Letters and the Financing Agreements) there are no agreements,
contracts, arrangements or understandings, whether written or oral, with any

 



      
 

 



 

Lender, Financing Source or other Person relating to the Debt Financing or the
Debt Commitment Letters that could affect the availability of the Debt
Financing.

 



 

(f) Except with respect to the Persons set forth in _Section 5.7(f)_ of the
Parent Disclosure Letter, none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives has entered into any contract,
agreement or understanding (i) that conditioned the awarding to any agent,
broker, investment banker or financial advisor of any financial advisory role
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby on such person
agreeing to advise any of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives on an exclusive basis in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or any Acquisition
Proposal or (ii) prohibiting or seeking to prohibit any bank or investment
bank or other potential provider of debt financing from providing or seeking
to provide debt financing or financial advisory services to any Person in
connection with a transaction relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries or
in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or
any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company
agrees that a breach of the representation and warranties set forth in this
_Section 5.7_ shall not result in the failure of a condition precedent to the
Companys obligations under this Agreement, if (notwithstanding such breach)
Parent and Merger Sub are willing and able to (and actually do) consummate the
Merger on the Merger Closing Date in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. As of the date of this Agreement,
the authorized share capital of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, 100 of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Merger Sub is,
and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent. Merger Sub was formed
solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby,
and it has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has no, and
prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations
of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Debt Financing).

 



 

Section 5.9 _Gaming Approvals and Licensing Matters_. None of Parent, Merger
Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any of their respective officers,
directors or Affiliates, any existing beneficial owner of five percent (5%) or
more of the voting stock of Parent, or any lender under the Debt Commitment
Letters, in each case who or which will be required to be licensed or found
suitable under applicable Gaming Laws in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, has
ever been denied a gaming license, approval, or related finding of suitability
by any Gaming Authority, or had any gaming license or approval revoked or
suspended. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of Parent, there are no
facts or circumstances with respect to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates insofar as such Affiliate-owned interest would be
attributable to Parent or Merger Sub under any applicable Gaming Law, that
would prevent or materially delay receipt of any Gaming Approvals.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.10 _Solvency_. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in _Sections 7.2(a)_ , _7.2(b)_ and _7.2(c)_ , each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will, after giving effect to all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Debt Financing, any Alternative
Financing and the payment of the Required Payment Amount, be Solvent at and
immediately after the Effective Time. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term " **Solvent** " means that, as of any date of determination and with
respect to any Person: (a) the sum of the debt (including contingent
liabilities) of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, does not
exceed the present fair saleable value of the present assets of such Person
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (b) the capital of such Person and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is not unreasonably small in relation to the
business of such Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and (c) such
Person and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, do not have debts including
current obligations beyond their ability to pay or refinance such debts as
they mature in the ordinary course of business; _provided_ , _however_ , for
the purposes hereof, the amount of any contingent liability at any time shall
be computed as the amount that, in light of all of the facts and circumstances
existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected
to become an actual or matured liability (irrespective of whether such
contingent liabilities meet the criteria for accrual under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard No. 5).

 



 

Section 5.11 _NRS 78.378 to 78.3793 and NRS 78.411 to 78.444; Ownership of
Company Securities_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, nor the "affiliates" or "associates" of any of them is, nor at
any time during the last two (2) years has any such Person been, an
"interested stockholder" of the Company, in each case as such term is defined
in NRS 78.3787 and NRS 78.423. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries beneficially owns (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act) any shares of Company Common Stock or
other securities of the Company or any options, warrants or other rights to
acquire Company Common Stock or other securities of the Company.

any employment agreement with any of the Companys directors, officers or
employees, (b) offered employment to any of the Companys directors, officers
or employees, (c) had negotiations with any of the Companys directors,
officers or employees regarding employment after the Merger Closing or (d)
sold, or offered to sell, any direct or indirect equity interest in the
Company to any of the Companys directors, officers or employees.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Brokers_. Other than Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.,
each of whose fees and expenses shall be borne solely by Parent, no broker,
finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other
fee or commission in connection with the Merger and any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or
on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

 



 

Section 5.14 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Article V, none of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates nor any other Person
on behalf of any of them makes any express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to Parent, Merger Sub or their

 



      
 

 



 

respective businesses or with respect to any other information provided, or
made available, to the Company or any of its Representatives or Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including the accuracy
or completeness thereof. Except with respect to the representations and
warranties of the Company expressly set forth in Article IV, there is and has
been no reliance by the Parent, Merger Sub, Financing Sub, any of their
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives on any express or
implied representation or warranty of the Company in connection with the

Section 6.2 _Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_.

 



 

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Proxy Statement_. As promptly as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement (and in any event no later
than the later of (x) twenty-five (25) calendar days after the date of this
Agreement or (y) ten (10) Business Days after the filing of the Companys Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014), the Company shall prepare and
cause to be filed with the SEC in preliminary form a proxy statement relating
to the Stockholders Meeting (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " **Proxy Statement** "). Except as expressly contemplated by
_Section 6.5(c)_ or _Section 6.5(d)_, the Proxy Statement shall include the
Company Board Recommendation with respect to the Merger. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC) or any request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall provide Parent
with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on the other hand.
Each of the parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to respond
as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC (or the staff
of the SEC) with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts so that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in
all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose
comments on such document or response (which comments shall be provided
promptly and be reasonably considered).

 



 

(b) _Covenants of Parent with Respect to the Proxy Statement_. Parent shall
furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as may
be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the Proxy Statement,
including such information that is required by the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement,
and shall otherwise assist and cooperate with the Company in the preparation
of the Proxy Statement and the resolution of comments from the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC). Parent will, upon request of the Company, confirm and/or
supplement the information relating to Parent or Merger Sub supplied by it for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement, such that at the time of the mailing of the
Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of
the Stockholders Meeting, such information shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Mailing of Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_. The Company shall,
as promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days
following the Proxy Statement Clearance Date), (x) establish a record date for
and give notice of a meeting of its stockholders, for the purpose of voting
upon the adoption of this Agreement (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof, the " **Stockholders  Meeting**") and (y) mail to the holders of
Company Common Stock as of the record date established for the Stockholders
Meeting a Proxy Statement (such date, the " **Proxy Date** "). The Company
shall duly call, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Proxy Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company, in its reasonable judgment and following consultation with Parent,
shall determine the length of any period for the solicitation of proxies from
its stockholders and, furthermore, that the Company may postpone, recess or
adjourn the Stockholders Meeting: (i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) for
the absence of a quorum or (iii) to allow reasonable additional time for the
filing and distribution of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the
Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel) is necessary or advisable under applicable Laws and for
such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated to and reviewed by
the Companys stockholders prior to the Stockholders Meeting. Once the
Company has established a record date for the Stockholders Meeting, the
Company shall not change such record date or establish a different record date
for the Stockholders Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent,
unless required to do so by applicable Law or the Bylaws. Unless the Company
Board shall have effected a Change in Recommendation, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement and shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with
the Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Laws
and all rules of the NYSE.

 



 

(d) _Amendments to Proxy Statement_. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any event or circumstance relating to the Company or Parent or any of the
Companys or Parents Subsidiaries, or their respective officers or directors,
is discovered by the Company or Parent, respectively, which, pursuant to the
Exchange Act, should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the Proxy
Statement, such party shall promptly inform the others. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company agrees to correct any information provided by it for use
in the Proxy Statement which shall have become false or misleading.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto shall (and shall cause each of their applicable
Affiliates and Subsidiaries to) use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and use its reasonable best efforts to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate, as promptly as
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties agree to use
its respective reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the conditions to the
Merger set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied as promptly as practicable,
(ii) obtain all necessary consents, approvals, orders, waivers, finding of
suitability and authorizations of, actions or nonactions by, any Governmental
Authority (including Gaming Authorities) or any third party necessary in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger and make all necessary

 



      
 

 



 

registrations, declarations and filings with, and notices to, any Governmental
Authorities (including pursuant to the HSR Act any other applicable Antitrust
Law necessary to start any applicable waiting period and including under
Gaming Laws) and take all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval from, or to avoid a suit, action, proceeding or investigation by, any
Governmental Authority or other Persons necessary in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger; _provided_ , that, in no event shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries be required to pay, prior to the Effective Time, any fee, penalty
or other consideration to obtain any consent, approval, order, waiver or
authorization in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, under any Contract other than _de minimis_
amounts or amounts that are advanced or reimbursed substantially simultaneous
by Parent and (iii) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary
to consummate the Merger and any other transactions to be performed or
consummated by such party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
to carry out fully the purposes of this Agreement. In no event shall the
Company (A) be required to agree to take or enter into any action which is not
conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger or (B) agree to any obligation
or concession or other action relating to the Antitrust Approval or the
Required Gaming Approvals without the prior written consent of Parent;
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed
that any failure by the Company to agree to any such obligation or concession
by reason of Parents withholding its written consent from the Company to do
so shall not constitute a breach by the Company of this _Section 6.3_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing or elsewhere in this
Agreement, it is understood and agreed that neither Parent nor Merger Sub
shall be required to accept, make or take (or cause its applicable Affiliates
or Subsidiaries to accept, make or take) any Divestiture Action in connection
with the matters contemplated by this Section 6.3 or otherwise (x) unless such
Divestiture Action is conditioned on the consummation of the Merger, and (y)
to the extent that such Divestiture Action, individually or in the aggregate
with all other Divestiture Actions, would or would reasonably be expected to
result in the loss of more than $85,000,000 in revenues on a consolidated
basis for Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) for the most recently ended twelve month period ending as of the
last day of Parents most recently completed fiscal quarter ( _provided_ ,
that if the last day of such period is after December 31, 2014, such period
will be deemed to have ended on December 31, 2014).

 



 

(b) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees (i) promptly after the
date hereof, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the date
hereof, to file all Notification and Report Forms required under the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) to file all other
notifications required under any other Antitrust Law or any Gaming Law with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger, (including all required initial applications and documents in
respect of officers and directors and Affiliates in connection with obtaining
the Gaming Approvals (and where appropriate indications of further information
to come by supplementary filing)) as soon as reasonably practicable (and in
any event within thirty (30) days following the date hereof with respect to
the Required Gaming Approvals), (iii) to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and documentary material in its
possession that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act, any other Antitrust
Law or any Gaming Law, and (iv) to use its reasonable best efforts to take or
cause to be taken all actions necessary, proper or advisable consistent with,
and subject to, the other provisions of this _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _6.3_ , to (A) cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law as promptly as reasonably
practicable, including, if possible under applicable Law, by requesting early
termination thereof, and (B) obtain all Gaming Approvals required to permit
the parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or necessary to permit Parent to acquire, own and operate the
Company. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referred to in _Section
6.3(a)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, any other
Antitrust Law or any Gaming Law, use reasonable best efforts to (A) cooperate
in good faith in devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining any
necessary clearances under any Antitrust Laws or Gaming Laws, (B) cooperate in
all respects with each other in connection with any filing or submission and
in connection with any investigation or other inquiry, including any
proceeding initiated by a private party; (C) keep the other party reasonably
informed of any communication received by such party from, or given by such
party to, any Governmental Authority and of any communication received or
given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby (other than to the
extent relating to private or personal information pertaining to any
individual which may remain confidential); and (D) reasonably permit the other
party to review any material communication given by it to, and consult with
each other in advance of any meeting or conference, where reasonably
practicable to do so, with, any Governmental Authority or, in connection with
any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent
permitted by such applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences (telephonic or in person), where reasonably practicable to do so
and in good faith take the other partys views into account regarding the
overall strategic direction of obtaining such clearances; _provided_ , that,
Parent, after prior, good faith consultation with the Company and after
considering, in good faith, the Companys views and comments, shall have the
principal responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy for
obtaining any of the Antitrust Approvals or Required Gaming Approvals and
shall take the lead in all meetings and communications with, or Proceeding
involving, any Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining the
Antitrust Approval and the Required Gaming Approvals; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the consent of each party shall be required prior to the taking of any
action (including the failure to take any such action) in connection with
obtaining the Antitrust Approval or any Required Gaming Approvals if such
action (or failure to act) would be reasonably likely to materially delay, or
materially impair the likelihood of obtaining, any such approvals.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in _Section 6.3(a)_ and _Section 6.3(b)_, subject to the last
sentence of _Section 6.3(a)_, if any objections are asserted with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or Gaming Law or
if any Proceeding, whether judicial or administrative, is instituted (or
threatened in writing to be instituted) by any Governmental Authority or any
other private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any Antitrust Law or Gaming Law or which would otherwise prevent
or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of
Parent and the Company shall, subject to the other provisions of this _Section
6.3_ (including the last two sentences of _Section 6.3(a)_), use reasonable
best efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to permit
consummation of the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Authority vacated or reversed and taking, or agreeing to take, a Divestiture
Action.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. From the date of this
Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the Company will, and
will cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, provide
to Parent and its authorized Representatives (x) reasonable access during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice from Parent to their
respective personnel, facilities, properties, books, contracts and records as
Parent may reasonably request and (y) such financial and operating data of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and other information with respect to the
business, properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall not be required to provide access to, or cause its Subsidiaries to
provide access to, or disclose (a) any information or documents which would
(in the reasonable judgment of the Company) be reasonably likely to (i)
constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) violate any applicable Laws (and the
Company shall be permitted to implement customary "clean-room" or other
similar arrangements if the Company reasonably determines, upon advice of
outside counsel, that such arrangements are necessary to comply with
applicable Law), (iii) unreasonably disrupt the businesses and operations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) breach any agreement of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any Third Party; _provided_ , that
each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any required
consents and take such other reasonable action (such as the entry into a joint
defense agreement or other arrangement to avoid loss of attorney client
privilege) to permit such access or disclosure; or (b) if the Company or any
of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its Affiliates, on
the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation, any information that is
reasonably pertinent thereto. All information exchanged pursuant to this
_Section 6.4_ shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and the
parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective Representatives
(as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to comply with, all of their
respective obligations thereunder.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Acquisition Proposals_. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this
_Section 6.5_, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or,
if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
the Company will not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of providing non-public
information) the making of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal
or request for information that may reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, or (ii) other than informing Third Parties of the
existence of the provisions contained in this _Section 6.5_, engage in
negotiations or substantive discussions with, or furnish any nonpublic
information to, any Third Party relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry, proposal or request for information that may reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
may ascertain facts from the party making such Acquisition Proposal for the
sole purpose of the Company Board informing itself about the Acquisition
Proposal and the party making it. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately

 



      
 

 



 

cease and cause to be terminated all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, immediately request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished and
immediately terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access previously
granted to any such Person or its Representatives.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the date that the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained
at the Stockholders Meeting, in the event that the Company receives a written
Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal was made after the date of
this Agreement and did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.5_, the
Company and the Company Board and their Representatives may, subject to
compliance with this _Section 6.5(b)_, (A) engage in negotiations or
substantive discussions (including, as a part thereof, making
counterproposals) with, or (B) furnish any information and other access to,
any Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives or
potential sources of financing if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors,
and based on information then available, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior
Proposal; _provided_ , that (x) prior to furnishing any material nonpublic
information, the Company receives from such Third Party an executed Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and (y) any such material nonpublic information so
furnished has been previously provided or made available to Parent or is
provided or made available (including through posting on the Electronic Data
Room) to Parent as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours
thereafter) after being so furnished to such Third Party. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 6.5 _by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Affiliates (including the Company Board or any committee thereof) acting in
such capacity shall constitute a breach of this _Section 6.5 _by the Company

 



 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this _Section
6.5(c)_ or _Section 6.5(d)_, neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or qualify or modify in any manner adverse to
Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or so qualify or modify), the
Company Board Recommendation, (B) (x) take any action to make the provisions
of Sections 78.378 through 78.3793, inclusive, of the NRS, applicable to
Parent and its Affiliates or (y) take any action or amend its Charter and
Bylaws to expressly elect not to be governed by the provisions of Sections
78.411 through 78.444, inclusive, of the NRS, or approve a combination (as
defined in such statutes) with any Person (other than Parent and its
Affiliates), or (C) approve, adopt or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or
propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any
action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " **Change in
Recommendation** ") or (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or similar
definitive agreement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with
any Third Party constituting or relating to any Acquisition Proposal (an "
**Alternative Acquisition Agreement** "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the

 



      
 

 



 

Requisite Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make a Change in
Recommendation and terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c)(ii) and
this Section 6.5(c) if the Company Board determines (after consultation with
its outside counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the
Company has provided Parent four (4) Business Days prior written notice
advising Parent that it intends to take such action and specifying, in
reasonable detail, the reasons for such action; and provided, further, that
the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ and this _Section 6.5(c)_ unless the Company pays, or causes to
be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section
8.3(a)(ii)_ prior to or concurrently with such termination.

 



 

(d) Without limiting _Section 6.5(c)_, at any time prior to receipt of the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, in response to a written Acquisition Proposal
made after the date of this Agreement and not the result of a breach of this
_Section 6.5 _that the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) constitutes a
Superior Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ and this _Section 6.5(d)_ and, concurrently with such
termination, may enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ and this _Section
6.5(d)_ unless the Company pays, or causes to be paid, to Parent the Company
Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ prior to or
concurrently with such termination.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ and _Section 6.5(d)_, (x) unless the Company shall have provided
to Parent four (4) Business Days prior written notice (the " **6.5(e)
Notice**") advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action (and
(unless a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreement has been
provided to Parent) specifying, in reasonable detail, the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Third Party
making any such Superior Proposal) and, if applicable, a copy of the relevant
proposed transaction agreement and all material related documentation, and
(y):

 



 

(i) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have engaged, and shall have caused its Representatives to
engage, in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding changes to the terms
of this Agreement intended to cause such Acquisition Proposal to no longer
constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 



 

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered any adjustments to this Agreement
(including a change to the price terms hereof) and the other agreements
contemplated hereby that may be offered in writing by Parent (the " **Proposed
Changed Terms** ") no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth
(4th) Business Day of such four (4) Business Day period and shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and
financial advisors) that the Superior Proposal

 



      
 

 



 

would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such Proposed Changed
Terms were to be given effect.

 



 

(it being understood that any material revision or amendment to the terms of
such Superior Proposal shall require a new 6.5(e) Notice and, in such case,
all references to four (4) Business Days in this Section 6.5(e) shall be
deemed to be two (2) days).

 



 

(f) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours
or, in the event the Company Board determines to take any of the actions
contemplated by _Section 6.5(b)_ in accordance with the terms thereof,
substantially concurrent with such determination) advise Parent orally or in
writing in the event that the Company receives any Acquisition Proposal, and
in connection with such notice, provide to Parent the material terms and
conditions (including the identity of the Third Party making any such
Acquisition Proposal) of any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status and material details (including any
material change to the terms thereof) of any such Acquisition Proposal and any
discussions and negotiations concerning the material terms and conditions
thereof.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing any position or disclosing any
information reasonably required under applicable Law or in compliance with or
otherwise complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the Companys stockholders), and
to the extent referred to therein, Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) making
any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the Companys stockholders), or (iii) making any disclosure
not of the type provided in clauses (i) or (ii) above to the Companys
stockholders that is reasonably required by applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company Board shall not make a Change in Recommendation
or make or authorize any disclosure which would reasonably be expected to have
the same effect as a Change in Recommendation, except in each case in
accordance with _Section 6.5(c)_.

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " **Acquisition Proposal** " shall mean, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any bona fide proposal or offer (other than a
proposal or offer by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) from a Third Party
relating to (i) a merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation, joint venture or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries whose revenues, income, EBITDA or assets, individually or
in the aggregate, constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the
consolidated revenues, income, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (in the case of assets, based on fair market value, as determined
in good faith by the Company Board); (ii) the acquisition (whether by merger,
consolidation, equity investment, joint venture or otherwise) by any Person of
twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (based on fair

 



      
 

 



 

market value, as determined in good faith by the Company Board); (iii) the
acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, by any Person of twenty-
five percent (25%) or more of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock; (iv) any purchase, acquisition, tender offer or exchange offer
that, if consummated, would result in any Person beneficially owning twenty-
five percent (25%) or more of the Company Common Stock or any class of equity
or voting securities of the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries whose
revenues, income, EBITDA or assets, individually or in the aggregate,
constitute twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the consolidated revenues,
income, EBITDA or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in the case of
assets, based on fair market value)), or (v) any combination of the foregoing.

 



 

(ii) " **Superior Proposal** " shall mean an Acquisition Proposal (the
references to "twenty-five percent (25%)" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)") made by a
Third Party on terms that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside counsel, and
considering such factors as the Company Board considers in good faith to be
appropriate (including the conditionality and the timing and likelihood of
consummation of such proposal), are more favorable to the holders of Company
Common Stock than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (after
giving effect to all Proposed Changed Terms).

 



 

Section 6.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a)
Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification
(and all rights to advancement of expenses relating thereto) for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any matters
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger), now existing in favor of the Indemnitees as provided in
the Charter or Bylaws (or such equivalent organizational or governing
documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of
this Agreement) or in any Contract between such Indemnitee and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (in each case as in effect on the date hereof) shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. From and after
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
and advance expenses to, to the fullest extent the Company would have been
permitted to do so under applicable Law, Indemnitees with respect to (x) all
acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time at or prior
to the Effective Time or (y) any costs or expenses (including attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to
the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of
or pertains to the Merger, this Agreement and any transactions contemplated
hereby, in either case, to the fullest extent permitted by (i) the Charter or
Bylaws (or such equivalent organizational or governing documents of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement), (ii) any
indemnification agreement of the Company or its Subsidiaries or other
applicable contract as in effect on the date of this Agreement, which
provisions thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
Indemnitees or (iii) applicable Law. Parent shall cause the articles of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to

 



       
 

 



 

contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and limitation of director, officer and employee liability that are no less
favorable to the Indemnitees than those set forth in the Charter and Bylaws
and the Companys Subsidiaries organizational documents as of the date of
this Agreement, which provisions thereafter shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any Indemnitees. Parent shall also cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor the Companys obligations pursuant to Section 6.6 of the
Manhattan Merger Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand
surety for, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants
contained in this Section 6.6.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.6(a)_, to the fullest
extent the Company would have been permitted to do so under applicable Law,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation will pay in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the
expenses (including attorneys fees) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount even if it
shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 6.6(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this _Section
6.6(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all liability arising out of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and does not include an
admission of fault or wrongdoing by any Indemnitee.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, at the Companys option, the Company shall
or, if the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-
cancelable extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the "
**D andO Insurance**"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period
of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to
any claim related to any period or time at or prior to the Effective Time (the
"Tail Policies") from the Companys current insurance carrier or an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies as in effect as of the
most recent renewal date. If such prepaid Tail Policies have been obtained by
either the Company or the Surviving Corporation prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for
its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the
Surviving Corporation. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation for any
reason fails to obtain such Tail Policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the
Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in
place as of the date hereof with the Companys current insurance carrier or
with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided

 



      
 

 



 

under the Companys existing policies as of the most recent renewal date, or
(ii) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a
period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys DandO Insurance with comparable
DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time from the Companys current insurance carrier or an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier, that is no less favorable than the existing policy of the
Company as of the most recent renewal date or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of two hundred and fifty
percent (250%) of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available,
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall assume,
be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand surety for,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in
accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in
this _Section 6.6(c)_.

 



 

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.6_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.6_. The provisions of this _Section 6.6_
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her
successors, heirs or representatives. To the fullest extent the Company would
have been permitted to do so under applicable Law, Parent shall pay all
reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnitee in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this
_Section 6.6_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.6_ shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the Charter or Bylaws (or
equivalent organizational or governing documents of any of the Companys
Subsidiaries), articles of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation, under any applicable Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnitee with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this _Section 6.6_
shall survive the consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be
binding, jointly and severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the
Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall ensure that proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this
_Section 6.6_ and use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that a Person no
less financially viable than the Surviving Corporation (in the event the
Effective Time occurs) remains responsible for the obligations of such party
under this _Section 6.6_.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Unless prohibited by applicable
Law, the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall give prompt notice to the Company, upon receiving Knowledge of (a) any
notice, complaint, investigation or hearing (or communications indicating that
the same may be contemplated) from any Governmental Authority in connection
with this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, (b)
any written notice of any Person (other than a Governmental Authority)
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, (c) any actions,
suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys
Knowledge, threatened in writing against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to this
Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, or (d) any
material change, effect, development or circumstance that would reasonably be
expected to give rise to a failure of a condition precedent in _Section 7.2_
(in the case of the Company) and _Section 7.3_ (in the case of Parent);
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties herein or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder and any failure to
make such notification (in and of itself) shall not be taken into account in
determining whether the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2_ (in the case of
the Company) and _Section 7.3_ (in the case of Parent) have been satisfied or
give rise to any right of termination to any party hereto under _Article
VIII_.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release(s) announcing
the execution of this Agreement shall be in a form mutually agreed upon by
Parent and the Company. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing, and, to the extent practicable, give each other a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on, any other press release or other public
announcements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
announcement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by
applicable Law, court process or the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, (i) the Company will no longer be
required to consult with Parent in connection with any such press release or
public announcement if the Company Board has effected any Change in
Recommendation or shall have resolved to do so and (ii) the requirements of
this _Section 6.8_ shall not apply to any disclosure by the Company or Parent
of any information concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby in connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this
Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _U.S. Continuing Employees_.

 



 

(i) During the one (1)-year period commencing at the Effective Time or such
shorter period as the applicable employee may be employed, Parent shall
provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to employees of
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries who are located in the United States
(" **US Company Employees** ") a base salary or wage rate and annual bonus at
least equal to the US Company Employees base salary or wage rate and annual
bonus in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and other
compensation (excluding equity,

 



      
 

 



 

equity-based and other similar long-term incentive opportunities) and benefits
(including vacation policies, retirement benefits, health, welfare and fringe
benefits or similar arrangements) that are, in the aggregate, no less
favorable than the compensation and benefits being provided to US Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(ii) Without limiting _Section 6.9(a)(i)_, during the one (1)-year period
commencing at the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide, to US Company Employees who experience a termination of employment
severance benefits that are no less than the severance benefits such employees
would be entitled to upon such a termination of employment under the severance
provisions set forth on _Section 6.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(iii) For purposes of eligibility, vesting (including vesting in respect of
any employer matching contribution under a cash or deferred arrangement under
Section 401(k) of the Code), and benefit accrual (solely for the purposes of
determining accrual of vacation and paid time off) under the compensation and
benefit plans, programs agreements and arrangements of Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any respective Subsidiary and Affiliate thereof
providing benefits to any US Company Employees after the Merger Closing (the "
**New Plans** "), and determination of level of benefits to the extent Parent
credits prior service of its similarly situated employees, each US Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
(including any predecessor), the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor employer, which,
for the avoidance of doubt, shall include SHFL entertainment, Inc. and any of
its affiliates) before the Merger Closing, to the same extent as such US
Company Employee was entitled, before the Merger Closing, to credit for such
service under any similar Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event shall US Company Employees be entitled to service credit to the
extent such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each US Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such US Company Employee participated
immediately before the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any US
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents to the extent such exclusions or
requirements were waived or satisfied under the comparable Company Benefit
Plan, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee
and his or her covered dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the
portion of the plan year prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance,
co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee
and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or in any Company Benefit Plan, for purposes of
any Company Benefit Plan containing a definition of "change in control" or
"change of control," the Merger Closing shall be deemed to constitute a
"change in control" or "change of control."

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.9_, the terms and conditions
of employment for any US Company Employees that are governed by a collective
bargaining agreement immediately prior to the Merger Closing shall continue to
be governed by such collective bargaining agreement as of the Merger Closing
until the expiration, termination or modification of such agreement in
accordance with its terms or applicable Law.

 



 

(b) _International Continuing Employees_. For the one (1)-year period
commencing at the Effective Time or such shorter period as the applicable
employee may be employed, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company located
outside of the United States with terms and conditions of employment,
including compensation (excluding equity, equity-based and other similar long-
term incentive opportunities) and benefit plans and arrangements (including
vacation policies, retirement benefits, health, welfare and fringe benefits
and any severance or similar arrangements) that are, in the aggregate, no less
favorable than those provided to such employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time, or such other terms and conditions of employment as may be
required by applicable Law.

 



 

(c) The Company shall provide Parent, with a copy of any material written
communications intended for broad-based and general distribution to any
current or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if such
communications relate to the transactions contemplated hereby and will provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review such communications prior to
distribution.

 



 

(d) This _Section 6.9_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.9_,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 6.9_ or
is intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or
modification of the Company Benefit Plans or any other employee benefit plan
or arrangement of the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates or
limit in any way the right of the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or any other
employee benefit plans or arrangements. Nothing in this _Section 6.9_ shall
limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any US Company Employee or any
international continuing employee at any time following the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) In addition to the foregoing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to honor the Companys obligations pursuant to Section 6.9 of the Manhattan
Merger Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to take all steps reasonably
necessary to (i) obtain, or assist in obtaining, any immigrant or non-
immigrant visa, work permit or similar authorization, and any extension,
amendment or renewal thereof, with respect to the individuals listed on
Section 6.9(f)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter, which schedule shall be
updated by the Company through the Effective Time; and (ii) maintain (A) the
immigrant or non-immigrant visas with respect to the US Company Employees, and
(B) the visas, work permits or similar authorizations with respect to
employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company located outside
of the United States, in each case, for no less than six (6) months following
the Effective Time.

 



 

(g) No later than ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall make available to Parent (i) information relating to each
payment (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) or benefit
that is conditioned on or accelerated by the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to any "disqualified individual" (as defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) that is reasonably expected to be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code) and (ii) each disqualified individuals "base amount"
(as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code).

 



 

Section 6.10 _Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger_. Parent and
Merger Sub covenant and agree with the Company that between the date hereof
and the earlier of the Effective Time and the date, if any, on which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, Parent shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take or agree to take any action
(including entering into agreements with respect to any acquisitions, mergers,
consolidations or business combinations) which would reasonably be expected to
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Financing_. (a) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that
the Company and its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives
shall not have any responsibility for, or incur any liability to any Person
under, any financing that Parent and Merger Sub may raise in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any cooperation provided
pursuant to _Section 6.12_ and that Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint
and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates
and its and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them
in connection with the Debt Financing and any information utilized in
connection therewith.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the
proceeds of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions, taken as a whole
(including the flex provisions) described in the Debt Commitment Letters,
including executing and delivering all such documents and instruments as may
be reasonably required thereunder and using (and causing their Affiliates to
use) their respective reasonable best efforts to:

 



 

(i) comply with and maintain in effect the Debt Financing and the Debt
Commitment Letters, negotiate and enter into Financing Agreements with

 



      
 

 



 

respect thereto (and maintain in effect and comply with the terms thereof) on
the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (as such
terms may be modified or adjusted in accordance with the terms of any "flex"
provisions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters (including as specified in
any Fee Letter)) or on other terms no less favorable, taken as a whole, to
Parent and Merger Sub than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, without limiting the foregoing, in no event
shall any of the Financing Agreements, except in accordance with the terms of
the Debt Commitment Letters: (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing provided for in the Debt Commitment Letter (including by changing
the amount of fees or original issue discount contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters) in a manner that would adversely impact in any material
respect the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger; (B)
expand, amend or modify the conditions or other contingencies to the receipt
or funding of the Debt Financing beyond those expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters in a manner that would adversely impact in any material
respect the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to obtain the Debt Financing
(including by making any such conditions or other contingencies less likely to
be satisfied, it being agreed that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub may modify, supplement or amend the Debt Commitment Letters to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof on
the same terms) or impose any new or additional condition or other contingency
to the receipt or funding of the Debt Financing in a manner that would
adversely impact in any material respect the ability of Parent and Merger Sub
to obtain the Debt Financing; (C) contain terms (other than those terms
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters) that would reasonably be
expected to (1) prevent or delay in any material respect the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or the date on which the Debt Financing
would be obtained, or (2) make the funding of the Debt Financing less likely
to occur; or (D) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
enforce its rights against the Financing Sources.

 



 

(ii) satisfy, or cause their Representatives to satisfy all conditions to the
Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and Financing
Agreements relating thereto (including by paying any commitment, engagement,
or placement or other fees that become due and payable under or with respect
to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements);

 



 

(iii) accept (and comply with) to the fullest extent all "market flex"
provisions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and the Financing
Agreements;

 



 

(iv) enforce its rights (including through litigation, to the extent
appropriate) under the Debt Commitment Letters and Financing Agreements in the
event of a breach (or threatened breach) by the Financing Sources under the
Debt Commitment Letters and Financing Agreements relating thereto, including
seeking specific performance of the parties thereunder; and

 



      
 

 



 

(v) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions precedent thereto, cause the
Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing at or prior to the time the
Merger Closing is required to occur pursuant to the terms and conditions
hereof.

 



 

(c) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall agree to or permit any amendment,
supplement or other modification or replacement of, or grant any waiver of,
any condition, remedy or other provision under any Debt Commitment Letter or
any Financing Agreements without the prior written consent of the Company if
such amendment, supplement, modification, replacement or waiver would or would
reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount) from that contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
delivered as of the date hereof in a manner that would adversely impact in any
material respect the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger, (ii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or
modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, in each
case, in a manner that would adversely impact in any material respect the
ability of Parent and Merger Sub to obtain the Debt Financing, (iii) make it
less likely that the Debt Financing would be funded (including by making the
conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing less likely to occur (it being
agreed that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub may modify,
supplement or amend the Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not
executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date hereof on the same terms))
or otherwise prevent or delay or impair in any material respect the ability or
likelihood of Parent or Merger Sub to timely consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iv) adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Debt Commitment Letters or (v) otherwise contravene the
limitations set forth in _Section 6.11(b)(i)(A)-(D)_. Other than in
connection with an Alternative Financing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall
agree to the withdrawal, repudiation, termination or rescission of any Debt
Commitment Letter or Financing Agreement or any provision thereof without the
prior written consent of the Company (it being agreed that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub may modify, supplement or amend the Debt
Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letters
as of the date hereof on the same terms). Upon any amendment, supplement or
modification of the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section
6.11(c)_, Parent shall deliver a copy thereof to the Company and references
herein to "Debt Commitment Letters" and "Debt Commitment Letters" shall
include such documents as amended, supplemented or modified in compliance with
this _Section 6.11(c)_ and references to "Debt Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as amended, supplemented
or modified in compliance with this _Section 6.11_ and the financing
contemplated by the Financing Agreements entered into in compliance with this
_Section 6.11_, as applicable.

 



 

(d) In the event that all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes or
would reasonably be expected to become unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including any "flex" provisions) or from the sources contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements for any reason or any of the
Debt Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements shall be withdrawn,
repudiated, terminated or rescinded for any reason, (i) Parent shall promptly
so notify the Company and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
respective

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event (and in any event no later than the
Merger Closing Date), and to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to, alternative financing from the same or alternative sources
(the " **Alternative Financing** "), on terms not less favorable, in any
material respect, with respect to conditionality and enforceability, when
taken as a whole, than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters to
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, in an amount sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or replace any unavailable
portion of the Debt Financing), and to obtain a new financing commitment
letter (including any associated engagement letter and related fee letter)
with respect to such Alternative Financing (collectively, the " **New Debt
Commitment Letter** "), copies of which shall be promptly provided to the
Company (with customary redactions with respect to the fee letter). In the
event any Alternative Financing is obtained and a New Commitment Letter is
entered into in accordance with this _Section 6.11(d)_ (i) any reference in
this Agreement to "Debt Financing" or the "Financing" shall mean the debt
financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to
clause (ii) below, and (ii) any reference in this Agreement to the "Debt
Commitment Letters" (or defined terms that use such phrase) shall be deemed to
include the Debt Commitment Letter (and any related Fee Letter) to the extent
not superseded by a New Debt Commitment Letter (or related new Fee Letter), as
the case may be, at the time in question and any New Debt Commitment Letter
(and any related new Fee Letter) to the extent then in effect. Without the
Companys prior written consent, Parent shall not directly or indirectly take
any action that would or would be reasonably expected to result in the Debt
Financing not being available.

 



 

(e) Any breach of the Debt Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements by
Parent or Merger Sub shall be deemed a breach by Parent of this _Section
6.11_. Parent shall (i) furnish the Company drafts (when available) and
thereafter complete, correct and executed copies of the Financing Agreements
promptly upon their execution, (ii) give the Company prompt written notice of
any default, breach or threatened breach by any party of any of the Debt
Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements of which Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their Representatives or Affiliates become aware or any termination or
threatened termination thereof, and (iii) otherwise keep the Company
reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
(or any Alternative Financing). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall give the Company prompt (and in any event within two
(2) Business Days) notice (A) of any breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any default or breach) related to the
Debt Financing of which Parent becomes aware, (B) of the receipt or delivery
of any notice or other communication, in each case from any Person with
respect to (x) any actual or potential breach of any provisions of the Debt
Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements by Parent or Merger Sub, or any
default, termination or repudiation by any party to any of Debt Commitment
Letters or Financing Agreements or other agreements relating to the Debt
Financing or (y) any dispute or disagreement between or among parties to any
of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements with respect to the
obligation to fund the Debt Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to
be funded at the Merger Closing and (C) if at any time for any reason Parent
believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources,
contemplated by any of the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements or
will be unable to obtain Alternative Financing. Parent shall promptly provide
any information reasonably requested by

 



      
 

 



 

the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C)
of the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(f) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining
of the Debt Financing is not a condition to the Merger Closing, and reaffirms
its obligations under this _Section 6.11_.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Financing Cooperation_. (a) Subject to _Section 6.11(a)_ and
the remaining provisions of this _Section 6.12_, prior to the Merger Closing,
the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at Parents sole
expense, reasonably cooperate in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing or any Alternative Financing, which cooperation by the Company shall
consist of, at the reasonable request of Parent, (i) furnishing Parent and
Merger Sub and their Financing Sources with customary financial information
(including the information required by paragraphs 4 and 5 of Exhibit E of the
Debt Commitment Letter) regarding the Company as reasonably requested by
Parent, including all financial statements and financial data of the type
required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of
type and form customarily included in offering memoranda for private
placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act (and with such exceptions as
is customary for an offering under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, including
without limitation, no need (A) to comply with Rules 3-09, 3-10 and 3-16 of
Regulation S-X or otherwise provide separate financial statements of any
Subsidiary and (B) to include Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by
Regulation S-K Item 402(b)) and in form and substance reasonably necessary for
the Financing Sources to receive customary accountants comfort letters, to
consummate the offerings of any debt securities contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter and of the type customary for one or more confidential
information memoranda in connection with the Debt Financing (all such
information required to be delivered or prepared pursuant to this Section
6.12(a)(i), together with any replacements or restatements thereof, if any
such information would be unusable under customary practices for such

the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Parent and Merger Sub against the
Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or
future general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates or assignees (collectively,
the " **Company Related Parties** ") for all Damages suffered as a result of
the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise), and upon
payment of such amount, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated thereby (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) (except that, to the extent any termination of
this Agreement resulted from, directly or indirectly, an Intentional Breach of
this Agreement by the Company or such Intentional Breach by the Company shall
cause the Merger Closing not to occur as provided under _Section 8.2_, Parent
shall be entitled to the payment of the Company Termination Fee (to the extent
owed pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_) and to any Damages, to the extent proven,
resulting from or arising out of such Intentional Breach (as reduced by any
Company Termination Fee previously paid by the Company).

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
but subject to _Section 9.9_, the Companys right to receive payment from
Parent of the Funding Failure Termination Fee or Regulatory Failure
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ shall constitute the sole and
exclusive monetary remedy of the Company and its stockholders against Parent
and its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) and any of their respective
former, current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, assignees or
Financing Sources (collectively, the " **Parent Related Parties** ") for all
Damages suffered as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise), and upon payment of such amount, none of the Parent Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) (except that (i) to the
extent any termination of this Agreement resulted from, directly or
indirectly, an Intentional Breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub or
such Intentional Breach by Parent or Merger Sub shall cause the Merger Closing
not to occur as provided under _Section 8.2_, the Company shall be entitled
to both the payment of the Funding Failure Termination Fee or Regulatory
Failure Termination Fee (to the extent owed pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_) and
to any Damages, to the extent proven, resulting from or arising out of such
Intentional Breach (as reduced by any Funding Failure Termination Fee or

 



       
 

 



 

Regulatory Failure Termination Fee paid by Parent and (ii) nothing shall limit
the Companys rights to indemnification and reimbursement in accordance with
_Section 6.12(b)_).

 



 

(c) _Integral Part of Transaction_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) none of the Company
Termination Fee, the Funding Failure Termination Fee or the Regulatory Failure
Termination Fee is a penalty, and except as set forth in _Section 8.3(b)(ii)_
and _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_, each is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount
that will compensate Parent or the Company (as applicable) in the
circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the parties
would not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay the Company
Termination Fee, or if Parent fails to pay the Funding Failure Termination Fee
or the Regulatory Failure Termination Fee, in each case pursuant to this
_Section 8.3_ when due, and, in order to obtain such payment, any other party
hereto commences a suit that results in a judgment against such party for the
Company Termination Fee, the Funding Failure Termination Fee or the Regulatory
Failure Termination Fee, as the case may be, such party shall pay to such
other party interest on the amount of the Company Termination Fee, the Funding
Failure Termination Fee or the Regulatory Failure Termination Fee, as the case
may be, from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of
payment at the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards
of directors at any time before or after receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Requisite Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that by Law
requires further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such
further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto;
_provided_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
_Section 8.3(b)(iii)_, _Section 8.3(c)_, this _Section 8.4_, _Section
9.7_, _Section 9.8_, _Section 9.9(b)_, _Section 9.10(c)_, _Section 9.12_
or _Section 9.14_ (in each case, together with any related definitions and
other provisions of this Agreement to the extent a modification or termination
would serve to modify the substance or provisions or such Sections) may not be
amended, modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is adverse to the
Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject
to the proviso of the first sentence of _Section 8.4_, waive compliance with
any agreement or condition contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of

 



      
 

 



 

any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party to any
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

_Section 6.12(b)_, _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_ and _Section 9.13_), all

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_.

 



 

(a) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The inclusion of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter or Parent
Disclosure Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission or evidence of
materiality of such item, nor shall it establish any standard of materiality
for any purpose whatsoever. No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Letter
relating to any possible breach or violation of any contract or Law shall be
construed as an admission or indication with respect to any third party that
any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.

 



 

(c) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section,
Appendix, Schedule, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of, or an Appendix, Schedule, Annex or Exhibit to, this Agreement,
unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings for this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein,"
"hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole, including all
Exhibits, Schedules and Annexes and Appendices, and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when
used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto
unless otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement
are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and
to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term.

 



 

(e) Any Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument
that is referred to herein means such Law as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of
comparable successor Laws and the related regulations and published
interpretations thereof; _provided_ , that for purposes of any representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of a specific date
or dates, references to any Law shall be deemed to refer to such Law, as
amended, and to any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case,
as of such date. References to a Person are also to its successors and
permitted assigns.

 



 

(f) The words "made available to Parent" or words of similar import refer to
documents (x) posted to the Electronic Data Room on or prior to the date
hereof or (y) delivered in Person or electronically to Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Representatives. The specification of any dollar
amount in any representation or warranty contained in _Article IV_ or
_Article V_ is not intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower
amounts, are or are not material for purposes of this Agreement, and no party
shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such amount in any dispute or
controversy between or among the parties as to whether any obligation, item or
matter not described herein or included in the Company Disclosure Letter or
the Parent Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. The phrases "the date of this Agreement" and "the date hereof" and
terms or phrases of similar import shall be deemed to refer to August 1, 2014,
unless the context requires otherwise. When used in reference to the Company
or its Subsidiaries, the term "material" shall be measured against the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The word "extent" in the phrase "to
the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing extends,
and

 



      
 

 



 

such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The word "will" shall be construed to
have the same meaning and effect as the word "shall." References to "$" or
"dollars" in this Agreement shall mean United States dollars. Words describing
the singular number shall be deemed to include the plural and vice versa,
words denoting any gender shall be deemed to include all genders and words
denoting natural Persons shall be deemed to include business entities and vice
versa.

 



 

(g) Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part
of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the
Effective Time, on the part of Parent and the Surviving Corporation to cause
such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires Merger
Sub or Financing Sub to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub or Financing
Sub, as applicable, to take such action.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future Law,
or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable,
(b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, and (c) all
other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in a mutually acceptable manner in
order that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto. Subject to the proceeding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits,
Schedules, Annexes and Appendices hereto and other documents delivered
pursuant hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, the entire
agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties and their Affiliates, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except
for (a) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of the Companys
stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time, (b)
from and after the Effective Time, the right of the holders of Company

 



      
 

 



 

Options to receive the Option Cash Payment at the Effective Time, (c) from and

Company Options and the holders of Performance Units, as applicable, to pursue
damages (including damages for their loss of economic benefits from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (" **Derivative Damages** ") in
the event of Parents or Merger Subs breach of this Agreement or fraud, which
right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Sub ( _provided_
that this clause is not intended, and under no circumstances shall be deemed,
to create any right of the holders of Company Common Stock, the holders of
shares of Company Restricted Stock or Company Restricted Stock Units, the
holders of Company Options and the holders of Performance Units to bring an
action against Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise),
(g) the provisions of _Section 6.6_ (which shall be enforceable by the
Indemnitees), (h) the provisions of _Section 6.12(b)_ (which shall be
enforceable by the 6.12 Indemnitees) and (i) with respect to the Financing
Sources, the provisions of _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_, _Section 8.3(c)_, _Section
8.4_, this _Section 9.7_, _Section 9.8_, _Section 9.9(b)_, _Section
9.10(c)_, _Section 9.12_ and _Section 9.14_. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance with _Section 8.5_ without notice or liability to any
other Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Accordingly, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub, Financing
Sub or the Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and
enforcement thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York (except that the provisions of
the Laws of the State of Nevada shall apply with respect to (i) the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board and (ii) any provisions set forth herein that are
required to be governed by such Laws or where such Laws are otherwise
mandatorily applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby). Except as
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements
related thereto, all actions, proceedings, or counterclaims (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) against the Financing Sources arising out of or
relating to the Debt Financing and the performance thereof by the Financing
Sources shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws
provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction)
that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than
the State of New York.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.9 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, except as otherwise
set forth in this _Section 9.9_, including the limitations set forth in
_Section 9.9(b)_, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties hereto
shall be entitled, without posting a bond or other indemnity, to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is acknowledged and
agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance of
Parents and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Merger only in the
event that each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (i) the
Marketing Period, if applicable, has ended and all of the conditions set forth
in _Sections 7.1_ and _7.2_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Merger
Closing, _provided_ that such conditions are reasonably capable of being
satisfied), (ii) Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete the Merger Closing by
the date the Merger Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section
2.2_, (iii) the Debt Financing (including any Alternative Financing that has
been obtained in accordance with, and satisfies the conditions of, _Section
6.11(d)_ of this Agreement) has been funded in accordance with the terms
thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Merger
Closing assuming satisfaction by Parent or Merger Sub of the conditions
precedent thereto under their respective control, and (iv) the Company has
confirmed in an irrevocable written notice delivered to Parent that if
specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, then it
would take such actions that are within its control to cause the Merger
Closing to occur. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) in no event shall the
Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents and
Merger Subs obligations to consummate the Merger if the Debt Financing has
not been funded or will not be funded at the Closing. For the avoidance of
doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance as
and only to the extent expressly permitted by this _Section 9.9_ and the
payment of the Funding Failure Termination Fee (only to the extent expressly
permitted by _Section 8.3(a)(iv)_), under no circumstances shall the Company
be permitted or entitled to receive both such grant of specific performance to
cause the Closing to occur in accordance with this Section 9.9 and payment of
the Funding Failure Termination Fee, or alternatively, any other monetary
damages or other monetary remedies, whether under this Agreement, the
Financing Commitment Letters or otherwise.

 



 

(c) [Reserved].

 



 

(d) Subject to _Section 9.9(b)_, each party hereby agrees not to raise any
objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance
to prevent or restrain breaches of this Agreement by such party, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of such Party under this Agreement all in

injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with such order or
injunction all in accordance with the terms of this _Section 9.9_. The
parties hereto further agree, subject to _Section 9.9(b)_, that (i) by
seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section 9.9_, a party shall not in
any respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be
available to a party under this Agreement in the event that this Agreement has
been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this
_Section 9.9_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii)
nothing set forth in this _Section 9.9_ shall require any party hereto to
institute any proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section 9.9_ prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under _Article VIII_, nor shall
the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.9_ or
anything set forth in this _Section 9.9_ restrict or limit any partys right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article VIII_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State
