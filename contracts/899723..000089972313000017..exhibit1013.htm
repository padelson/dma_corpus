capital stock of CrisolteQ OY, a company organized under the laws of Finland
("Crisolteq");

WHEREAS, OMG owns 615,385 shares (the "QSI Shares") of capital stock of

ARTICLE I 

Purchase and Sale; Closing

SECTION 1.01. Purchase and Sale of the Subject Shares. At the Closing, the
Sellers shall sell, transfer and deliver or cause to be sold, transferred and
delivered to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase from the Sellers, the
Subject Shares.

SECTION 1.02. Purchase and Sale of the Purchased Assets. At the Closing, the
Sellers shall sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver, or cause to be sold,
conveyed, transferred, assigned and delivered, to Purchaser all of the assets
set forth on Schedule I (the "Purchased Assets"). The purchase and sale of the
Subject Shares and the Purchased Assets and the assumption and transfer of the
Assumed Liabilities is referred to in this Agreement as the "Acquisition". For
the avoidance of doubt, the Subject Shares do not constitute Purchased Assets.
Accordingly, Section 1.04 and 1.05 are not applicable to the Subject Shares.

SECTION 1.03. Excluded Assets. Purchaser expressly understands and agrees that
all assets of the Sellers other than the Subject Shares and the Purchased
Assets shall remain the property of Sellers and their applicable subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Excluded Assets").

SECTION 1.04. Assumed Liabilities. At the Closing, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser shall assume the Liabilities of
the Sellers to the extent relating to or arising out of the Purchased Assets,
including those set forth on Schedule II (the "Assumed Liabilities").
Purchaser's obligations under this Section 1.04 shall not be subject to offset
or reduction, whether by reason of any actual or alleged breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in any agreement or document
delivered in connection with this Agreement or any right to indemnification
hereunder or otherwise.

SECTION 1.05. Excluded Liabilities. Purchaser is assuming only the Assumed
Liabilities from the Sellers and is not assuming any other Liability of the
Sellers of whatever nature, whether presently in existence or arising
hereafter. All such other Liabilities shall be retained by and remain
Liabilities of the Sellers, as applicable (all such Liabilities not being
assumed being herein referred to as the "Excluded Liabilities").

SECTION 1.06. Limitations on Assignment of Purchased Assets. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to assign any Purchased Asset or any right thereunder
if an attempted assignment, without the consent of, or other action by, any
third party, would constitute a breach thereunder or in any way adversely
affect the rights of Purchaser or the Sellers or any of their respective
affiliates thereunder; provided that the foregoing shall not limit or affect
the Sellers' representations and warranties in Articles II and III or the
conditions set forth in Section 6.02. Each Seller and Purchaser shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts (but without any payment of money) to
obtain the consent of such third parties to any such Purchased Asset or any
right thereunder for the assignment thereof to Purchaser as Purchaser may
reasonably request. If such consent is not obtained or such other action is
not taken, the Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate in a mutually agreeable
manner to establish an arrangement under which Purchaser would obtain the
benefits and assume the obligations thereunder in accordance with this
Agreement, including sub-contracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to
Purchaser or an affiliate designated by Purchaser, or under which a Seller or
any of its affiliates would enforce (at the reasonable direction of Purchaser)
for the benefit of Purchaser or its designated affiliate, with Purchaser or
its designated affiliate assuming the obligations of such Seller or its
affiliates, any and all rights of such Seller or any of its affiliates against
a third party thereto (including, if applicable, the right to elect to
terminate such Purchased Asset in accordance with the terms thereof upon
Purchaser's request). Each Seller shall promptly pay to Purchaser or its
designated affiliate when received all monies received by such Seller or any
of its affiliates under any Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any
benefit arising thereunder, except to the extent the same represents an
Excluded Asset. Upon receipt of any required consents to assignment of a
Purchased Asset, the applicable Seller shall, or shall cause its affiliates
to, sell, convey, transfer, assign and deliver such Purchased Asset to
Purchaser with no additional purchase price due therefore. In addition,
following the Closing, the parties shall execute and deliver, or shall cause
to be executed and delivered, such documents and other instruments and shall
take, or shall cause to be taken, such further actions as may be reasonably
required to carry out this Section 1.06 and give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 1.06.

SECTION 1.07. Purchase Price; Allocation of Purchase Price

(a) The purchase price for the Purchased Assets and the Subject Shares is
$325,000,000 in cash (the "Base Purchase Price") plus the amount of payments,
if any, to be paid by Purchaser pursuant to the provisions set forth in
Exhibit A upon the terms and conditions set forth therein (together with the
Base Purchase Price, the "Purchase Price"). The Base Purchase Price shall be
paid as provided in Section 1.09, and the Base Purchase Price shall be subject
to adjustment as provided in Section 1.10.

(b) The Base Purchase Price shall be allocated to the Purchased Assets and the
Subject Shares as set forth in the statement attached hereto as Schedule III
(the "Allocation Statement"). If an adjustment is made with respect to the
Base Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.10, the Allocation Statement shall
be adjusted consistent therewith.

SECTION 1.08. Closing Date. The closing of the Acquisition (the "Closing")
shall take place at the offices of Jones Day, 901 Lakeside Avenue, Cleveland,
Ohio, 44114 U.S.A., at 10:00 a.m. on the business day that is the second full
business day after the date on which the conditions set forth in Article VI
are satisfied (or, to the extent permitted, waived by the parties entitled to
the benefits thereof), or at such other place, time and date as shall be
agreed among the Sellers and Purchaser. The date on which the Closing occurs
is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".

SECTION 1.09. Closing Deliveries. At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver to
the Sellers the following:

(i) payment, by wire transfer to one or more bank accounts designated in
writing by the Sellers (such designation to be made by the Sellers at least
three business days prior to the Closing Date), of an amount in immediately
available funds equal, in the aggregate, to the Base Purchase Price less an
amount equal to Certified Indebtedness plus an amount equal to the estimated
amount of Cash on Hand as of the close of business on the Closing Date
("Estimated Cash on Hand") as set forth in a certificate delivered by the
Sellers to Purchaser no later than three business days prior to the Closing.
Sellers will use reasonable efforts to ensure that Estimated Cash on Hand
shall be approximately $30,000,000;

(ii) payment to the applicable lenders, by wire transfer to one or more bank
accounts designated in writing by the Sellers (such designation to be made by
the Sellers on a business day that is at least three full business days prior
to the Closing Date), of an amount equal to Certified Indebtedness;

(iii) the certificate to be delivered pursuant to Section 6.03;

(iv) a counterpart of the Transition Services Agreement attached as Exhibit B
hereto (the "Transition Services Agreement"), duly executed by OMG Kokkola
Chemicals;

(v) a counterpart of the Cobalt Alloy Sales Agreement attached as Exhibit C

certificates, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by stock powers duly
endorsed in blank in proper form for transfer, with appropriate transfer tax
stamps, if any, affixed;

(ii) the certificate to be delivered pursuant to Section 6.02;

(iii) such deeds, bills of sale, endorsements, assignments and other good and
sufficient instruments of conveyance and assignment as the parties and their
respective counsel shall deem reasonably necessary to vest in Purchaser all
right, title and interest in, to and under the Purchased Assets and to
evidence Purchaser's assumption of the Assumed Liabilities;

(iv) duly signed resignations, effective immediately after the Closing, of all
directors of the Companies;

(v) a counterpart of the Transition Services Agreement duly executed by the
Sellers;

(vi) a counterpart of the Cobalt Alloy Sales Agreement duly executed by OMG
Finland;

(vii) a counterpart of the Distribution Agreement duly executed by OMG
Americas;

(viii) a counterpart of the Services Agreement duly executed by OMG Americas;
and

(ix) evidence reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser that the Contract listed as
item 31 on Section 3.09(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Letter has been
amended to remove OMG Kokkola Chemicals as a party thereto.

SECTION 1.10. Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to the Sellers a working capital statement (the "Final
Working Capital Statement"), setting forth the Net Working Capital as of the
close of business on the Closing Date (the "Final Working Capital") and Cash
on Hand as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Final Cash on
Hand"). The Final Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in accordance
with the same accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies
used in the preparation of the Working Capital Statement.

(b) Within 30 days following receipt by the Sellers of the Final Working
Capital Statement, the Sellers shall deliver written notice to Purchaser of
any dispute the Sellers have with respect to the preparation or content of the
Final Working Capital Statement; provided, however, that the Sellers may not
dispute the accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies used
in preparing the Final Working Capital Statement if they are the same as the
accounting principles, practices, methodologies and policies used in preparing
the Working Capital Statement. If the Sellers do not so notify Purchaser of a
dispute with respect to the Final Working Capital Statement within such 30-day
period, such Final Working Capital Statement will be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties. In the event of such notification of a dispute,
Purchaser and the Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
dispute. If Purchaser and the Sellers, notwithstanding such good faith effort,
fail to resolve such dispute within 15 days after the Sellers advise Purchaser
of their objections, then Purchaser and the Sellers jointly shall engage KPMG,
LLP (the "Accounting Firm") to resolve such dispute. As promptly as
practicable, and in any event not more than 15 days thereafter, Purchaser and
the Sellers shall each prepare and submit a presentation detailing each
party's complete statement of proposed resolution of the dispute to the
Accounting Firm. As soon as practicable thereafter, Purchaser and the Sellers
shall cause the Accounting Firm to choose one of the parties' positions based
solely upon the presentations by Purchaser and the Sellers. The parties shall
share the expenses of the Accounting Firm equally. All determinations made by
the Accounting Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties.

(c) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this Section 1.10,
each party shall cooperate with and make available to the other parties and
their respective representatives all information, records, data and working
papers, and shall permit access to its facilities and personnel, as may be
reasonably required in connection with the preparation and analysis of the
Final Working Capital Statement and the resolution of any disputes thereunder
(subject to reasonable confidentiality restrictions and to providing such
assurances, releases, indemnities or other agreements as accountants may
customarily require in such circumstances).

(d) If the Target Working Capital and Estimated Cash on Hand, when taken
together, exceed Final Working Capital and Final Cash on Hand, when taken
together (each, as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.10(b)), then the
Base Purchase Price will be adjusted downward by the amount of such excess,
and the Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such
excess to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available United States
funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Purchaser to the
Sellers. Any such payment is to be made within five business days of the date
on which the Final Working Capital is finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.10.

(e) If the Final Working Capital and Final Cash on Hand, when taken together
(each, as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.10(b)), exceed the Target
Working Capital and Estimated Cash on Hand, when taken together, then the Base
Purchase Price will be adjusted upward by the amount of such excess, and
Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to such excess
to the Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available United States funds
to an account or accounts designated in writing by the Sellers to Purchaser.
Any such payment is to be made within five business days of the date on which
the Final Working Capital is finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.10.

SECTION 1.11. Withholding. Either party hereto or any of their respective
affiliates (including, effective upon the Closing with respect to Purchaser,
the Companies), shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amount
otherwise payable to the other party hereto pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as they are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under any applicable Law. If any amount is so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be timely paid to the appropriate Tax Authority and
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such other
party hereto.

together with expert advisors that it has engaged for such purpose. Purchaser
and its representatives have been provided with access to the properties,
offices, plants and other facilities, books and records of the Companies and
other information that they have requested in connection with their

contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Sellers nor any of their
affiliates or representatives are making, directly or indirectly, any
representation or warranty with respect to any estimates, projections or
forecasts involving the Companies. Purchaser acknowledges that there are
inherent uncertainties in attempting to make such estimates, projections and
forecasts and that it takes full responsibility for making its own evaluation

Assets and the Subject Shares), (ii) furnish promptly to Purchaser, at

upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreements shall terminate with respect

Purchaser acknowledges that the obligations of confidentiality and non-
disclosure with respect to any and all other information provided to Lundin
Mining Corporation and Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold Inc. by the Sellers
Representatives concerning the Sellers or any of its affiliates (other than

is defined in the Confidentiality Agreements).

(d) After the Closing, the Sellers shall hold, and shall cause their
affiliates to hold, and each shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants,
advisors and agents to hold, in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by
applicable Law, all confidential documents and information concerning the
Companies, the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the
Subject Shares, except that such information may be disclosed to the extent
Confidential Information (as that term is defined in the Confidentiality
Agreements) is permitted to be disclosed pursuant to the Confidentiality
Agreements. The obligation of the Sellers and their affiliates to hold any
such information in confidence shall be satisfied if they exercise the same
care with respect to such information as they would take to preserve the
confidentiality of their own similar information.

SECTION 5.04. Notices of Certain Events. The Sellers and Purchasers shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto of:

(x) any notice or other communication from any person (including any labor
organization, union or other similar entity) alleging that the consent of such
person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; and

(xi) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

SECTION 5.05. Reasonable Best Efforts. Prior to the Closing, Purchaser and the
Sellers shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to consummate and
make effective in the most expeditious manner possible the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement including (i) the preparation and filing of all
forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the satisfaction of the
other parties' conditions to consummating the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (iii) taking all actions reasonably necessary to obtain (and
cooperating with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization, order or
approval of, or any exemption by, any third party, including any Governmental
Entity (which actions shall include furnishing all information required under
applicable Antitrust Laws and in connection with approvals of or filings with
any other Governmental Entity) required to be obtained or made by Purchaser,
the Sellers and the Companies or any of their respective affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the taking
of any action contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement. Additionally, each of Purchaser, the Sellers and
the Companies shall use all reasonable best efforts to fulfill all conditions
precedent to the Acquisition and shall not take any action after the date of
this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to materially delay the
obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any permission, approval or consent
from any Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained prior to the Closing.

(g) Prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other
parties to this Agreement with respect to, provide any necessary information
with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other parties
(or their counsel) copies of), all filings made by such party with any
Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such party to, or
correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party to this
Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to this Agreement of any
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If any party to this Agreement or any
representative of such parties receives a request for additional information
or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will use
reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly and after
consultation with the other parties to this Agreement, an appropriate response
in compliance with such request. To the extent that transfers of any permits
issued by any Governmental Entity to the Sellers or their affiliates are
required as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the parties hereto shall use
reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers.

(h) Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as promptly as
practicable, and, in any event, no later than the 30th calendar day following
the date of this Agreement (the "Filing Deadline") any filings and/or
notifications under all applicable Antitrust Laws, including those set forth
on Schedule IV, and shall use reasonable best efforts to respond, as promptly
as practicable, to any inquiries received for additional information or
documentation and to respond, as promptly as practicable, to all inquiries and
requests received from any state Attorney General or other Governmental Entity
in connection with antitrust matters.

(i) Purchaser shall use all reasonable best efforts to resolve such
objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Laws that are
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust
Laws"). In connection therewith, if any action is instituted (or threatened to
be instituted) challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Laws, Purchaser shall use all
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and
that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the Acquisition or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section
5.05(d) shall limit the right of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.01, so long as such party hereto has, up to the time of
termination, complied in all material respects with its obligations under this
Section 5.05(d).

(j) Prior to the Closing, each party shall, and shall cause its affiliates to,
use reasonable best efforts (at its own expense) to obtain, and to cooperate
in obtaining, all consents and waivers from third parties necessary or
appropriate to permit the consummation of the Acquisition; provided, however,
that the parties shall not be required to pay or commit to pay any amount to
(or incur any obligation in favor of) any person from whom any such consent or
waiver may be required (other than nominal filing or application fees or de
minimis amounts); provided, further, that no Seller nor any of its affiliates
shall, without Purchaser's prior written consent, grant any waiver, make any
concession or otherwise amend or alter any terms of any Contract in order to
obtain any consent or waiver. Each Seller shall (i) obtain Purchaser's prior
written consent prior to distributing any documentation to be used by any
Seller or any of its affiliates to third parties in connection with the giving
or obtaining any consent or waiver and (ii) promptly upon their receipt make
available to Purchaser copies of any and all substantive correspondence
between such Seller or any of its affiliates and the party to any Contract (or
its agents) relating to any such consent or waiver or the transactions
contemplated hereby. At all times prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall keep
Purchaser reasonably informed of the status of obtaining any required third
party consents and waivers. Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents and
waivers with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
required from parties to the Contracts listed in the Seller Disclosure Letter
and that such consents and waivers have not been obtained. Subject to
compliance with this Section 5.05(e), no Seller or any of its affiliates shall
have any Liability whatsoever to Purchaser arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any consents or waivers that may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of the
termination of any Contract as a result thereof.

(k) At all times prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall keep Purchaser
reasonably informed of the status of negotiations with respect to the Subject
Agreement. Seller shall, and shall cause its affiliates to, (i) provide
Purchaser the opportunity to review and comment on all drafts of the Subject
Agreement and consider such comments in good faith and (ii) promptly upon
their receipt make available to Purchaser copies of any and all substantive
correspondence between such Seller or any of its affiliates and the counter-
party to the Subject Agreement (or its agents). In the event that OMG Kokkola
Chemicals and the counter-party to the Subject Agreement do not enter into a
binding agreement prior to Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause OMG
Kokkola Chemicals to, use its commercially reasonable efforts (x) to continue
negotiations with such counter-party in good faith and enter into the Subject
Agreement, it being understood that Purchaser shall not initiate any material
expansion of the scope of the draft Subject Agreement beyond the scope of the
latest draft disclosed to Purchaser by Seller prior to the date hereof and (y)
so long as the representation in Section 3.15(g) shall survive, to ensure the
continued discharge of wastewater to the clarification ponds owned and
operated by Boliden in a manner substantially consistent with past practice
and as described in the Boliden Permit, subject to compliance by the counter-
party with the terms of the Boliden Permit.

(l) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the parties hereto
understand and agree that nothing in this Section 5.05 shall be construed to
require any party hereto to (A) enter into any settlement, undertaking,
consent decree, stipulation or agreement with any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or (B) divest or
otherwise hold separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise), or
take any other action (or otherwise agreeing to do any of the foregoing) with
respect to any of its or any of its respective affiliates' businesses, assets
or properties.

SECTION 5.06. Expenses; Transfer Taxes. Whether or not the Closing takes
place, and except as set forth in this Section 5.06 and Article VIII and IX,
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such
expense, including all costs and expenses incurred pursuant to Sections 1.10
and 5.05. Purchaser and the Sellers shall share equally the filing fee of the
notification and report form, if any, required for the transactions
contemplated hereby pursuant to the required filings or notifications under
the Antitrust Laws set forth on Schedule 5.06.

(k) All Transfer Taxes applicable to the transfer of the Subject Shares and
the Purchased Assets shall be shared equally by Purchaser, on the one hand,
and the Sellers, on the other hand. Purchaser shall file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes. Each
party shall use reasonable efforts to avail itself of any available exemptions
from any such Transfer Taxes, and to cooperate with the other parties in
providing any information and documentation that may be necessary to obtain
such exemptions. For the avoidance of doubt, such Transfer Taxes shall include
the Finland Security Transaction Tax.

SECTION 5.07. Employee Matters. To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
Section 5.07(a) of Seller Disclosure Letter lists each Business Employee as of
the date hereof, including the name, title, work location, employer, whether
full- or part-time, whether active or on leave (and, if on leave, the nature
of the leave and the expected return date), annual salary or wage rate, most
recent annual bonus received, current annual bonus opportunity and, solely
with respect to the Business Employees in Finland, vacation and paid time off
accrual.

(d) At or prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall make, or shall cause one of
its affiliates to make, offers of employment to each of the individuals
identified in Section 5.07(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter that are not
employees of a Company (the "Transferred Employees"), so long as they
otherwise qualify for employment by Purchaser based on the hiring criteria set
forth in Section 5.07(a) of the Disclosure Letter. The Sellers shall provide
an updated list of the Transferred Employees five days prior to the Closing
Date to reflect any changes in the Transferred Employees, including, with
respect to Transferred Employees, new hires, retirements, resignations,
dismissals and other employment terminations, which may have occurred at any
time or on or prior to the Closing Date. Any offers of employment will be made
in compliance with Purchaser's usual and customary hiring procedures, which
may include, as permitted by applicable Law, the successful completion of drug
tests and background checks. Such employment offers shall provide compensation
and employee benefits that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those
applicable to such Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing;
provided, however, that the value of any previous agreement entered into by
any individual with the Sellers that would trigger any payment of compensation
or benefits solely as a result of the consummation any of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall not be included in any such determination. Purchaser
shall give Transferred Employees full credit for purposes of eligibility,
vesting and benefit accruals (other than benefit accrual under a defined
benefit pension plan (other than any Company Plan)) under the Employee Plans
or other comparable benefit plans in which such Transferred Employee
participates to the same extent recognized under the Employee Plans or other
comparable benefit plans, as applicable, immediately prior to the Closing.
Purchaser, the Companies and their affiliates shall have no obligations or
liabilities (i) with respect to any current or former individual service
providers to the Business (including employees and independent contractors of
the Sellers or the Business) other than Business Employees (including
Transferred Employees), (ii) with respect to liabilities relating to the
Business Employees who are not employees of the Companies, which liabilities
arose or were incurred prior to the Closing, other than obligations and
liabilities imposed under Company Plans and (iii) any liabilities or
obligations that arise under the Retention Agreements.

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, OMG Harjavalta shall cause OMG Finland and OMG
Kokkola Chemicals to transfer the employment of each OMG Finland Business
Employee into the sole employment of OMG Kokkola Chemicals with the result
that, as of the Closing, each such OMG Finland Business Employee shall
continue employment with the Business as of and after the Closing.

(f) Section 5.07(d) of Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth, for each
individual independent contractor engaged by the Business whose annual
compensation exceeds $100,000, such contractor's name, work location, duties
and rate of compensation.

(g) Except for the Seller Plans listed on Section 5.07(e) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, effective as of the Closing Date, each Business Employee
shall become fully vested in his or her accounts and benefits under each of
the Seller Plans.

(h) (i) Neither Purchaser nor any of its affiliates shall be obligated to
continue to employ any Business Employee for any period of time following the
Closing Date, (ii) Purchaser or its affiliates may revise, amend or terminate
any Company Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or policy in
effect from time to time following the Closing Date, (iii) nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed as an amendment of any Employee Plan, and (iv) no
provision of this Section 5.07 shall create any third-party beneficiary rights
in any current or former director, officer, employee or individual independent
contractor of any of the Companies (including any beneficiary or dependent of
such individual) or any other person.

(i) The Sellers shall cause OMG Finland to transfer the Selekta group pension
insurance, agreements numbers 367/476, 367/560 and 1572 (the "Insurance
Plans") to OMG Kokkola Chemicals (or an affiliate of Purchaser designated by
Purchaser), including all assets and liabilities relating to the Insurance
Plans (including amounts withdrawn from or borrowed against the Insurance
Plans prior to the Closing). The Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser for any
payments required to be made to the insurers in respect of the Insurance Plans
relating to service of the OMG Finland Employees prior to the Closing Date.

SECTION 5.08. Publicity. From the date hereof through the Closing Date, no
party shall, and each party shall cause its affiliates not to, issue any
public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby
without the prior consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), except as such release or announcement may be required
by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any United States or foreign
securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement (or the party whose affiliates are required to make such release
or announcement) shall allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on
such release or announcement in advance of such issuance to the extent
reasonably practicable; provided, however, that after the transactions
contemplated hereby have been announced, Purchaser and Sellers shall be
entitled to respond to questions in the ordinary course or issue any press
release or make any other public statement that, in each case, is consistent
with any public statement previously issued or made by Purchaser, Sellers or
their respective affiliates in accordance with the provisions of this Section
5.08.

SECTION 5.09. Names Following Closing. Within 90 days following the Closing,
Purchaser shall (i) change the legal names of the Companies so as not to
include the Names, and Purchaser and its affiliates shall not thereafter use
the Names except as provided in this Section 5.09, and (ii) amend the
organizational documents of the Companies as necessary to reflect the name
changes required by clause (i). "Names" means "OM Group" and "OMG" and any
names that are derivatives thereof or confusingly similar thereto, and any
trademarks or logos owned by the Sellers or any of their affiliates, or that
the Sellers or any of their affiliates have rights to use and that are set
forth on Section 5.09 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, in each case, as of
immediately after the Closing.

(a) After the Closing, Purchaser and its affiliates shall have the right to
(i) sell existing inventory and (ii) use existing packaging, labeling,
containers, stationery, business forms, supplies, advertising and promotional
materials and any similar materials bearing any Name until the earlier of 180
days following the Closing and the date existing stocks of the foregoing are
exhausted (the "Name Transition Period") (it being understood that the use of
existing stocks of the foregoing after the Name Transition Period shall not
constitute use of the Names if (x) all depictions of the Names thereon are
labeled over or otherwise deleted, blocked or covered or (y) it would be
commercially impracticable to take the actions described in the foregoing
clause (x)); provided, however, that (A) neither Purchaser nor any of its
affiliates shall take any action that could reasonably be expected to
materially impair the value of the Names, (B) when using the items listed in
clause (ii) above in the context of entering into or conducting contractual
relationships with third parties, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to inform such third parties that Purchaser or one of its affiliates,
rather than the Sellers or their affiliates, is the party entering into or
conducting the contractual relationship with such third parties, and (C)
personnel of Purchaser and its affiliates using the above items shall not, and
shall have no authority to, hold themselves out as officers, employees or
agents of the Sellers or any affiliate of any the Sellers (it being understood
that any actions taken by such personnel in compliance with this Section 5.09
shall not be considered to constitute such personnel holding themselves out in
such manner). Purchaser and its affiliates shall comply with all applicable
Laws in any use of packaging or labeling containing the Names except for such
uses as were made in the conduct of the Business prior to the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.09 to the contrary, Purchaser and
its affiliates shall not be required at any time to take any action with
respect to the use of any materials described in this Section 5.09(b) in the
possession of customers, clients, distributors, dealers and other authorized
third parties prior to the expiration of the Name Transition Period.

(b) The Sellers shall not unreasonably withhold their consent to the extension
of the Name Transition Period in the event that Purchaser and its affiliates
are not reasonably able to exhaust the existing stocks of the materials
described in Section 5.09(b) prior to the expiration of the Name Transition
Period.

(c) Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cease using the
Names on fixed assets as soon as is reasonably practicable after the Closing
and in any event within 180 days after the Closing.

(d) Nothing in this Section 5.09 shall, or be understood or construed to,
prohibit, prevent or restrict Purchaser or any of its affiliates from making
any fair use of any Name at any time.

SECTION 5.10. Business / Non-Business Assets. Prior to the Closing, the
Sellers shall effect all transfers and take all such actions as are necessary
so that any Excluded Assets and the assets set forth on Section 5.10 of the
Seller Disclosure Letter are held by an affiliate of the Sellers. The Sellers
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to transfer all of OMG's and
its affiliates' right, title and interest in and to the QSI Shares to OMG
Kokkola Chemicals prior to the Closing and, in the event such transfer does
not occur prior to the Closing, shall continue to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such transfer as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Closing. In the event that at any time or from time to time after
the Closing Date the Sellers, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other
hand, (or any of their respective affiliates) shall receive or otherwise
possess any asset (including cash) that should belong to another person
pursuant to this Agreement, such person shall promptly transfer, or cause to
be transferred, such asset to the person so entitled thereto to the extent
permitted by applicable Law. In furtherance of the foregoing and Section 1.06,
(a) Purchaser undertakes and agrees to return any Excluded Assets and the
assets set forth on Section 5.10 of the Seller Disclosure Letter that are
owned by the Sellers or any of their affiliates and are transferred to
Purchaser at or after the Closing, and to forward or remit to the Sellers of
any payments received by Purchaser or any of its affiliates on account of any
Excluded Asset and (b) the Sellers undertake and agree to transfer any
Purchased Assets and any right, title or interest in the QSI Shares that are
owned by Purchaser or any of its affiliates and are retained by the Sellers at
or after the Closing, and to forward and remit to Purchaser any payment on
account of any Purchased Asset, including any accounts or notes receivable.
Prior to any such transfer, the person receiving or possessing such asset
shall hold such asset in trust for such other person.

SECTION 5.11. Resignations.

(c) The Sellers will deliver or caused to be delivered to Purchaser the
resignations of all directors of the Companies from their positions with the
Companies at or prior to the Closing Date.

SECTION 5.12. Intercompany Matters. All intercompany accounts between the
Sellers or any of their affiliates (other than the Companies), on the one
hand, and the Companies, on the other hand, as of the Closing Date shall be
settled (irrespective of the terms of payment of such intercompany accounts)
in the manner provided in this Section 5.12. At least five business days prior
to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a
statement setting out in reasonable detail the calculation of all such
intercompany account balances substantially in the form attached as Section
5.12(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter based upon the latest available
financial information as of such date and, to the extent reasonably requested
by Purchaser, provide Purchaser with supporting documentation to verify the
underlying intercompany charges and transactions. To the extent any
intercompany account balances remain outstanding as of the Closing, the
Purchaser and Seller will settle all outstanding balances within 15 calendar
days after the Closing or as soon as reasonably practicable after such
outstanding balances are finally determined. If the aggregate of all such
outstanding intercompany account balances owed to the Sellers or any of their
affiliates (other than the Companies) exceeds the aggregate of all such
outstanding intercompany account balances owed to the Companies, then the
Companies shall pay to OMG such difference. If the aggregate of all such
outstanding intercompany account balances owed to the Companies exceeds the
aggregate of all such outstanding intercompany account balances owed to the
Sellers or any of their affiliates (other than the Companies), then OMG shall
pay to the Companies such difference.

(c) Except for the settlement of intercompany accounts as contemplated under
Section 5.12(a), all intercompany Contracts between the Sellers or any of
their affiliates (other than the Companies) relating to the Business, on the
one hand, and the Companies, on the other hand, shall, in each case, be
terminated immediately prior to the Closing without any further liability or
obligation on the part of any party thereto.

SECTION 5.13. Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; No-Hire. The Sellers agree
that none of the Sellers nor any of their subsidiaries shall (i) for a period
of three years after the Closing Date engage in, control or manage any
business that develops, commercializes, manufactures, markets, distributes or
sells products currently in development by or commercialized, manufactured,
marketed, distributed or sold by, the Business as of the Closing Date
(including any business that conducts activities competitive with the
Business) (the "Restricted Business"); provided, however, that the
restrictions contained in this Section 5.13(a)(i) shall not restrict the
acquisition by the Sellers or any of their affiliates, directly or indirectly,
of less than 5% of the outstanding capital stock of any publicly traded
company engaged in the Restricted Business or in the provision of services of
a type competitive with those provided in the Restricted Business, (ii) for a
period of three years after the Closing Date solicit the performance of
services by any current employee of the Companies, other than pursuant to a
general solicitation made to the general public or (iii) for a period of one
year after the Closing Date, employ or receive or accept the performance of
services by any current employee of the Companies.

(h) If any provision contained in this Section 5.13 shall for any reason be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Section 5.13, but this Section 5.13 shall be construed as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the
intention of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants
contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of
time which is not permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be
too broad or to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to
be null, void and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be
valid or enforceable under applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction
shall construe and interpret or reform this Section 5.13 to provide for a
covenant having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other
provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and
enforceable under such applicable Law. The Sellers acknowledge that Purchaser
may be irreparably harmed by any breach of this Section 5.13 and that there
would be no adequate remedy at law or in damages to compensate Purchaser for
any such breach. The Sellers agree that Purchaser shall be entitled to seek
injunctive relief requiring specific performance by the Sellers of this
Section 5.13.

SECTION 5.14. Insurance Policies. The Sellers shall use reasonable efforts in
good faith to facilitate the making of any claims by the Companies under the
Policies. If any Policy does not permit the Companies to directly file a
claim, the Sellers or their affiliates shall file such claim on behalf of the
Companies and shall use reasonable best efforts to seek reimbursement under
the applicable Policy. Any reimbursement obtained by the Sellers or their
affiliates shall be promptly remitted to the Companies, as applicable.

SECTION 5.15. No Further Financial Obligations. Purchaser acknowledges that in
the course of conduct by the Companies of their respective businesses,
Sellers, and their respective affiliates, and direct and indirect subsidiaries
of any of them (collectively, but excluding the Companies, the "OM Group
Entities") entered into various arrangements (i) in which guarantees were
issued by the OM Group Entities and (ii) in which the OM Group Entities are
the primary obligors on other agreements, in any such case to support or
facilitate business transactions or programs of the Companies, including those
arrangements set forth in Section 5.15 of the Sellers Disclosure Letter. The
arrangements referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) are hereinafter
referred to as the "Guarantees". It is understood that the Guarantees shall
not continue after the Closing. Purchaser agrees that it shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain replacements of the Guarantees which
will be in effect at the Closing or, in the case of the Guarantees described
in the foregoing clause (ii), to arrange for itself or one of its subsidiaries
to be substituted as the primary obligor thereon as of the Closing Date. In
the event that Purchaser is unable to satisfy the terms of the immediately
preceding sentence, Purchaser and its affiliates shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the OM Group Entities from and against any and all losses and
Liabilities of the OM Group Entities relating to the Guarantees.

SECTION 5.16. Cobalt Alloy Sales Agreement. The Sellers shall provide written
notice to Purchaser of the timing and amount of any assignment and payment
required to be made to OMG Finland pursuant to Article 11.2 of the Special
Provisions of the Cobalt Alloy Sales Agreement at least five business days
prior thereto.

(vi) by mutual written consent of the Sellers and Purchaser;

(vii) by the Sellers if any of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.01 or

have been waived by the Sellers;

(viii) by Purchaser if any of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.01 or
6.02 shall have become incapable of fulfillment by the End Date, and shall not
have been waived by Purchaser; or

(ix) by the Sellers, on the one hand, or Purchaser on the other hand, if the
Closing does not occur on or prior to the sixth month anniversary of the date
hereof (the "End Date"); provided, however, that the End Date shall be
extended automatically to the nine month anniversary of the date hereof if on
the six month anniversary of the date hereof the conditions to Closing set
forth in Article VI other than the conditions set forth in Section 6.01 are
satisfied (or are capable of fulfillment should the Closing occur on the next
Business Day);

provided, further, that the party seeking termination pursuant to clause (ii),
(iii) or (iv) is not then in breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

(h) In the event of termination by the Sellers or Purchaser pursuant to this

any other party of its obligations under such provisions.

ARTICLE VIII 

Tax Matters

SECTION 8.01. Tax Sharing Agreements. The Sellers shall cause the provisions
of any Tax Sharing Agreement or arrangement between the Sellers or any of
their affiliates (other than the Companies) and the Companies, to be
terminated on or before the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, no party
shall have any rights or obligations under any such Tax Sharing Agreement.

(f) Apportionment. Except as otherwise provided herein, all Taxes and Tax
liabilities with respect to the income, property or operations of the Business
that relate to any taxable period that includes but does not end on the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period") shall be apportioned between the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period as follows: (a) in the case
of Taxes that are either (i) based upon or related to income, receipts,
capital or net worth (but not including sales and compensating use Taxes), or
(ii) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of
property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than conveyances
pursuant to this Agreement, as provided under Section 5.06(b)), such Taxes
shall be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the Tax year
ended with the Closing Date; provided, however, that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated between
such two periods in proportion to the number of days in such period; and (b)
in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the Business,
or otherwise measured by the level of any item, such Taxes shall be deemed to
be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such
Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the
immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
period. Subject to the previous sentence and Section 8.02(a), the Sellers
shall be liable for all Taxes with respect to the Business attributable to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period except to the extent taken into account as a liability
in the determination of Final Net Working Capital.

(g) Return Filings.

(iii) The Sellers or their designee shall prepare and timely file (including
extensions), or cause to be prepared and timely filed (including extensions),
in proper form with the appropriate Taxing Authority all necessary Tax Returns
of or which include or relate to the Business for Pre-Closing Tax Periods that
are required to be filed (including extensions) on or prior to the Closing
Date (including all Tax Returns the Companies file jointly with a Seller or
any of its affiliates (other than the Companies)). The Sellers shall pay or
shall cause to be paid any and all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Return
filings.

(iv) The Sellers or their designee shall prepare and timely file (including
extensions), or cause to be prepared and timely filed (including extensions),
in proper form with the appropriate Taxing Authority all consolidated,
combined or unitary Tax Returns of the Sellers that include or relate to the
Business with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any short
period) that are not required to be filed on or prior to the Closing Date,
other than the consolidated, combined or unitary returns of the Companies. The
Sellers shall permit Purchaser to review and comment on each such Tax Return
prior to filing it and shall reasonably and in good faith consider such
revisions to such Tax Returns as are requested by Purchaser. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Sellers shall not be required to revise such Tax Returns to
increase income in any Pre-Closing Tax Period, unless otherwise required by
Law. The Sellers shall pay or shall cause to be paid any and all Taxes due
with respect to such Tax Returns. Purchaser shall provide or cause to be
provided to the Sellers in a timely manner all necessary data and other
information to prepare all Tax Returns described in this Section 8.01(c)(ii).

(v) Purchaser or its designee shall prepare and timely file (including
extensions), or cause to be prepared and timely filed (including extensions),
in proper form with the appropriate Taxing Authority all Tax Returns required
to be filed for any Straddle Period of the Business. Purchaser shall prepare,
or shall cause to be prepared, all such Tax Returns in a manner consistent
with past practice, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Purchaser
shall pay or cause to be paid any and all Taxes with respect to the Business
due with respect to such Tax Returns except to the extent that such Taxes
exceed the aggregate accruals or reserves for Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period taken into account in the determination of Final Net Working Capital.
The Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid to Purchaser the amount by which the
Tax due for the Pre-Closing Tax Period exceeds the amount taken into account
as liability in the determination of Final Net Working Capital for such period
at least 5 business days before any Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of
the Sellers files such Tax Return.

(vi) Purchaser shall prepare and file, or shall cause one or more of the
Companies to prepare and file, in proper form with the appropriate Taxing
Authority, all Tax Returns of or that include the Business for which the
Sellers are not responsible pursuant to Sections 8.01(c)(i) and 8.01(c)(ii).
Subject to Section 8.02, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid any and all
Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns.

(vii) With respect to any Tax Returns for any Straddle Period, to the extent
permissible, but not required, pursuant to applicable Tax Law, the Sellers may
and Purchaser or its affiliates shall, at the Sellers' direction, cause the
Business to (a) take all steps as are or may be reasonably necessary,
including the filing of elections or returns with applicable Taxing
Authorities, to cause such period to end on the Closing Date or (b) if clause
(a) is inapplicable, report the operations of the Business only for that
portion of such period ending on the Closing Date in a combined, consolidated,
or unitary Tax Return filed by the Sellers or an affiliate, notwithstanding
that such taxable period does not end on the Closing Date.

(viii) Purchaser shall prepare and file in proper form with the appropriate
Finnish Taxing Authority, all Tax Returns related to the Finland security
transaction tax payable with respect to the estimated value of the Earn-out
Payments (the "Finland Security Transaction Tax"). Purchaser shall permit the
Sellers to review and comment on each such Tax Return prior to filing it and
shall reasonably and in good faith consider such revisions to such Tax Returns
as are requested by the Sellers.

(h) Cooperation. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, audit
examinations, and any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the
Tax liabilities imposed on or relating to the Sellers or the Companies with
respect to the Business for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods or the Earn-out
Payments, Purchaser and the Companies on the one hand, and the Sellers on the
other hand, shall cooperate fully with each other, including by furnishing or
making available during normal business hours, records, personnel (as
reasonably required and at no cost to the other party), books of account,
powers of attorney or other materials necessary or helpful for the preparation
of such Tax Returns, the conduct of audit examinations or the defense of
claims by Tax authorities as to the imposition of Taxes. The Sellers and their
affiliates will need access, from time to time, after the Closing Date, to
certain accounting and Tax records and information held by the Business to the
extent such records and information pertain to events occurring prior to the
Closing Date and during the Straddle Period; therefore, Purchaser shall cause
the Business to, (i) use its best efforts to properly retain and maintain such
records until such time as the Sellers agree that such retention and
maintenance is no longer necessary; (ii) cause the Business to provide to the
Sellers information regarding the Businesses' payment of any non-US taxes
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period and original
receipts from the applicable Taxing Authorities showing payment thereof, in
each case within 5 business days of the payment of such taxes; and (iii) allow
the Sellers and their agents, at times and dates mutually acceptable to the
parties, to inspect, review and make copies of such records as the Sellers may
deem necessary or appropriate from time to time, such activities to be
conducted during normal business hours and at the Sellers' expense. Any
information obtained under this Section 8.01(d) shall be kept confidential,
except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

(i) Refunds and Credits. Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to the
Sellers any Tax refunds or credits, together with interest thereon, with
respect to the Business (except to the extent reflected on the Balance Sheet
or due as the result of the carry back of a net operating or capital loss
arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period) attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or any Tax refunds or credits attributable to the Finland Security
Transaction Tax (but in such a case, half of such Tax refund or credit)
received by or credited to Purchaser or a Company, net of any direct costs
attributable to receipt of such refund or credit, including Taxes payable with
respect to such refund, within 10 business days after the receipt of such
refund or the realization of such credit. All refunds with respect to the
Business attributable to any (i) Post-Closing Tax Period or (ii) Pre-Closing
Tax Period not otherwise payable to the Sellers shall be for the benefit of
Purchaser and if received by or otherwise credited to the Sellers or any
affiliate thereof (other than a Company), the Sellers shall pay or cause to be
paid an amount equal to such refund or credit to Purchaser within 10 business
days after the receipt of such refund or the realization of such credit. At
the Sellers' request, Purchaser and the Companies shall cooperate with the
Sellers in obtaining such refunds, including through the filing of amended Tax
Returns or refund claims as prepared by the Sellers, at their own expense.
Purchaser shall permit the Sellers to control the prosecution of any such
refund claim and, where deemed appropriate by the Sellers, shall authorize by
appropriate powers of attorney such persons as the Sellers shall designate to
represent the Companies with respect to such refund claim.

(j) None of Purchaser or any of its affiliates or any directors, officers or
employees of the foregoing shall make, or permit to be made, any election with
respect to, or otherwise change, the entity classification of the Companies
for income Tax purposes for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date without Seller's consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

(k) The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the assets that are deemed to
be acquired for U.S. federal tax purposes pursuant to this Agreement in
accordance with Section 1060 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder (and any
similar provision of U.S. state or local Law, as appropriate) (the "U.S.
Allocation"). Such allocation shall be consistent with the allocation provided
in Section 1.07(b). The U.S. Allocation shall be agreed by Purchaser and the
Sellers within 180 days after the Closing Date. If any Earn-out Payment is
made, the U.S. Allocation shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code as mutually agreed by Purchaser and the Sellers within 20 days after
the final determination of the Earn-out Payment; provided, however, that any
Earn-out Payment made shall be allocated solely to the Subject Shares in a
manner consistent with the Allocation Statement and no allocation of any Earn-
out Payment shall be made to the Purchased Assets. If Purchaser and the
Sellers cannot agree on such allocation or such adjustment within the
specified time period, Purchaser and the Sellers shall jointly retain a
nationally recognized accounting firm to resolve the disputed items. Purchaser
and the Sellers agree to file all Tax Returns (including but not limited to
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) consistent with this allocation.

(l) No party to this Agreement shall make an election under Section 338 of the
Code with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 8.02. Tax Indemnification. From and after the Closing, the Sellers
shall jointly and severally indemnify Purchaser, its affiliates (including the
Companies) and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents, successors, assigns and representatives (the "Purchaser
Indemnitees") against and hold them harmless from (i) all liability for Taxes
of the Business or any affiliated group of which the Companies have ever been
a member for the Pre-Closing Tax Period (apportioned in accordance with
Section 8.01(b)), (ii) all liability for Taxes of the Sellers or any other
corporation which is or has been affiliated with the Sellers (other than the
Companies) and (iii) any liabilities, costs, expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable expenses of investigation and attorneys' fees and
expenses), losses, damages, assessments, settlements or judgments arising out
of or incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any such Taxes
(together, a "Tax Loss"), provided, however that the Sellers shall not be
required to indemnify for any Tax to the extent the amount of such Tax was
taken on the Closing Date into account as a liability in the determination of
Final Net Working Capital. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall
not indemnify and hold harmless any Purchaser Indemnitee from any liability
for Taxes attributable to any action taken after the Closing by Purchaser, any
of its affiliates (including the Companies), or any transferee of Purchasers
or any of its affiliates (other than any such action expressly required by
applicable Law or by this Agreement) (a "Purchaser Tax Act") or attributable
to a breach by Purchaser of its obligations under this Agreement.

(m) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify the Sellers and
their affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents and representatives (the "Seller Indemnitees") and hold
them harmless from (i) all liability for Taxes of the Business for any Post-
Closing Tax Period, except to the extent arising out of Seller's breach of
representations made under this Agreement and (ii) all liability for Taxes
attributable to a Purchaser Tax Act or to a breach by Purchaser of its
obligations under this Agreement.

(n) Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims.

(i) If a claim shall be made by any Taxing Authority, which, if successful,
Purchaser reasonably determines could result in an indemnity payment to any
Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 8.02, Purchaser shall promptly
notify the Sellers in writing of such claim (a "Tax Claim"). If notice of a
Tax Claim is not given to the Sellers within a sufficient period of time to
allow the Sellers to effectively contest such Tax Claim, or in reasonable
detail to apprise the Sellers of the nature of the Tax Claim, in each case
taking into account the facts and circumstances with respect to such Tax
Claim, the Sellers shall not be liable to any Purchaser Indemnitee to the
extent that the Sellers' position is materially prejudiced as a result
thereof.

(ii) With respect to any Tax Claim relating solely to Taxes of the Business
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Sellers shall control all proceedings taken
in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser) and, without limiting the foregoing, may in its
discretion pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings,
hearings and conferences with any Taxing Authority with respect thereto;
provided, however that the Sellers shall consult with Purchaser upon
Purchaser's reasonable request for such consultation from time to time with
respect to such proceeding, and may, in their discretion, either pay the Tax
claimed and sue for a refund where applicable Law permits such refund suits or
contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; provided, however the Sellers
may not settle any controversy without Purchaser's consent. With respect to
any Tax Claim relating to Taxes of the Business for a Straddle Period, (a)
each party may participate in all proceedings taken in connection with such
Tax Claim, at its expense, and (b) the proceedings taken in connection with
such Tax Claim shall be controlled by that party which would bear the burden
of the greater portion of the sum of the adjustment and any corresponding
adjustments that may reasonably be anticipated for future Tax periods.

(iii) In no case shall any Purchaser Indemnitee settle or otherwise compromise
any Tax Claim without the Sellers' prior written consent. Neither party shall
settle a Tax Claim relating solely to Taxes of the Business for a Straddle
Period without the other party's prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(iv) The indemnification obligation set forth in Section 8.02(a) shall survive
until 30 days after the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations
(giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof).

(v) Any indemnification of a Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to this Section
8.02 shall be effected by wire transfer or transfers of immediately available
funds from the Sellers to an account or accounts designated in writing by the
applicable Purchaser Indemnitee to the Sellers within 15 days after the final
determination thereof.

Purchaser in any document or certificate delivered in connection herewith

those representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.01 (Organization,

SECTION 9.02. Other Indemnification by the Sellers.

(l) (1) From and after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall jointly and
severally indemnify and save and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnitees from
and against any Covered Losses incurred or suffered by any such Purchaser
Indemnitees to the extent resulting from or arising out of: (A) any
misrepresentation of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the
Sellers referenced in Section 9.01(a) (determined, except with respect to
Section 3.04, Section 3.08(d) or Section 3.13(a), without regard to any
qualification or exception contained therein relating to "materiality",
"material", "in all material respects" or any similar qualification (except to
the extent the word "material" (x) is in all capital letters or (y) is used in
a defined term, including Sellers Material Adverse Effect, Business Material
Adverse Effect and Material Contract); (B) any nonfulfillment or breach of any
covenant or agreement made by the Sellers in this Agreement that survives the
Closing Date pursuant to Section 9.01(b); (C) any Excluded Liability; (D) any
Seller Retained Indemnified Liabilities; and (E) any Indemnified Environmental
Liability.

(i) The Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to assert any
indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.02 after the expiration of the
applicable survival period referenced in Section 9.01; provided, however, that
if, on or prior to such expiration of the applicable survival period, a notice
of claim shall have been given to the Sellers in accordance with Section 9.04
for such indemnification, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall continue to have the
right to be indemnified with respect to such indemnification claim until such
claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided
in this Article IX.

(ii) Any indemnification of a Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to this Section
9.02 shall be effected by wire transfer or transfers of immediately available
funds from the Sellers to an account or accounts designated in writing by the
applicable Purchaser Indemnitee to the Sellers within 15 days after the final
determination thereof.

(m) The Sellers shall have no liability for indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.02(a)(i)(A) or Section 9.02(a)(i)(E) with respect to Covered Losses
for which indemnification is provided thereunder unless such Covered Losses
exceed in the aggregate $6,500,000 (such amount of Covered Losses equaling
$6,500,000, the "Deductible"), in which case the Sellers shall be liable for
(i) 50% of the first $6,500,000 in Covered Losses in excess of the Deductible
and (ii) all such Covered Losses in excess of such amount referred to in
clause (i); provided, however, that in no event shall the Sellers have any
liability or indemnification obligation pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i)(A) and
Section 9.02(a)(i)(E) for Covered Losses in excess of $40,000,000 in the
aggregate; provided, however that the preceding limitations shall not apply to
indemnification with respect to (x) any misrepresentation of or inaccuracy in
any Seller Fundamental Representation or the representations and warranties
contained in Section 3.15(g) or (y) any claims of, or causes of action arising
from, fraud. Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Sellers shall have no liability
for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i)(A) with respect to Covered
Losses for which indemnification is provided thereunder with respect to any
misrepresentation of or inaccuracy in Section 3.15(g) unless such Covered
Losses exceed in the aggregate $1,000,000; provided, however, that in no event
shall the Sellers have any liability or indemnification obligation pursuant to
Section 9.02(a)(i)(A) for Covered Losses for any misrepresentation of or
inaccuracy in Section 3.15(g) in excess of $30,000,000 in the aggregate; and
provided further, that any indemnification by Sellers with respect to Covered
Losses for any misrepresentation or inaccuracy in Section 3.15(g) shall not be
taken into account for purposes of determining the limitations on amounts
payable by Sellers pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence of this
Section 9.02(b). No Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover from an
indemnifying party more than once in respect of the same Covered Losses.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Purchaser has not made all
of the filings and/or notifications contemplated by Section 5.05(c) on or
prior to the Filing Deadline, the representations and warranties of Sellers
contained in Article II and Article III shall not be made as of the Closing
Date and shall be made only as of the date of this Agreement.

(n) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, Purchaser
acknowledges that its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all
claims relating to this Agreement, the Acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, the Companies (other than claims of, or causes of action
arising from, fraud) shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in Article VIII and this Article IX. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Purchaser and each of the Companies hereby waive, from and after the Closing,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising
from, fraud) each may have against the Sellers and their affiliates arising
under, based upon or relating to this Agreement, the Acquisition and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, the Companies any document or certificate
delivered in connection herewith, any applicable Law or otherwise (except
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in Article VIII and this
Article IX).

SECTION 9.03. Other Indemnification by Purchaser.

(j) (1) From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall indemnify and save
and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees from and against any Covered Losses
incurred or suffered by any such Seller Indemnitees to the extent resulting
from or arising out of: (A) any misrepresentation of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty of Purchaser referenced in Section 9.01(a)
(determined without regard to any qualification or exception contained therein
relating to materiality or any similar qualification or standard); (B) any
nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement made by Purchaser in
this Agreement that survives the Closing Date pursuant to Section 9.01(b); (C)
the Assumed Liabilities; and (D) subject to Section 9.01(b), the operation of
the Business after the Closing.

(i) The Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to assert any indemnification
pursuant to this Section 9.03 after the expiration of the applicable survival
period referenced in Section 9.01; provided, however, that if, on or prior to
such expiration of the applicable survival period, a notice of claim shall
have been given to Purchaser in accordance with Section 9.04 for such
indemnification, the Seller Indemnitees shall continue to have the right to be
indemnified with respect to such indemnification claim until such claim for
indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in this
Article IX.

(ii) Any indemnification of a Seller Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 9.03
shall be effected by wire transfer or transfers of immediately available funds
from Purchaser to an account or accounts designated in writing by the
applicable Seller Indemnitee to Purchaser within 15 days after the final
determination thereof.

(k) Purchaser shall have no liability for indemnification pursuant to Section
9.03(a)(i)(A) with respect to Covered Losses for which indemnification is
provided thereunder unless such Covered Losses exceed in the aggregate
$6,500,000, in which case Purchaser shall be liable for all such Covered
Losses in excess of such amount; provided, however, that in no event shall
Purchaser have any liability or indemnification obligation for Covered Losses
in excess of $40,000,000; provided, however that the preceding limitations
shall not apply to indemnification with respect to (x) any misrepresentation
of or inaccuracy in any Purchaser Fundamental Representation or (y) any claims
of, or causes of action arising from, fraud. No Seller Indemnitee shall be
entitled to recover from an indemnifying party more than once in respect of
the same Covered Losses.

(l) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, the Sellers
acknowledge that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all
claims relating to this Agreement, the Acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, and the Companies (other than claims of, or causes of
action arising from, fraud) shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in Article VIII and this Article IX. In furtherance of
the foregoing, each of the Sellers hereby waives, from and after the Closing,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes of action arising
from, fraud) it may have against Purchaser and its affiliates arising under,
based upon or relating to this Agreement, the Acquisition and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, the Companies, any document or certificate
delivered in connection herewith, any applicable Law or otherwise (except
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in Article VIII and this
Article IX.).

SECTION 9.04. Procedures. Third Party Claims. In order for a person (the
"Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under
Section 9.02 or 9.03 in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made
by any person against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim"), such
Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying party in writing (and in
reasonable detail taking into account the information then available to the
Indemnified Party) of the Third Party Claim within 10 business days after
receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party Claim;
provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party
shall have been prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the indemnifying party, as promptly as
reasonably practicable and in any event within ten days after the Indemnified
Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

(j) Assumption. If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party,
the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9.04(c), to assume the
defense thereof with counsel selected by the indemnifying party; provided,
however, that (i) such counsel is not reasonably objected to by the
Indemnified Party, (ii) prior to assuming control of such defense, the
indemnifying party must furnish the Indemnified Party with evidence that the
indemnifying party has adequate resources to defend the Third Party Claim and
fulfill its indemnity obligations, if any, hereunder. In the event that the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim in accordance
with this Section 9.04, the indemnifying party shall have a sixty (60) day
period (the "Discovery Period") following receipt by the indemnifying party of
notice of such Third Party Claim during which the indemnifying party shall be
entitled to reasonable discovery with respect to the indemnifiable nature of
the claims. The indemnifying party and the Indemnified Party shall reasonably
cooperate with each other with respect to such discovery. If the indemnifying
party does not provide written notice to the Indemnified Party by the end of
the Discovery Period that it no longer continues to assume the defense of the
Third-Party Claim, the claims made in that Third-Party Claim will be
conclusively established for purposes of this Agreement as within the scope of
and subject to indemnification hereunder. Should the indemnifying party so
elect to assume and continue the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance
with and subject to the limitations of this Section 9.04, the indemnifying
party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof
following the Discovery Period. If the indemnifying party assumes such
defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel (not reasonably objected to by the
indemnifying party), at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by
the indemnifying party, it being understood that the indemnifying party shall
control such defense in accordance with and subject to the limitations of this
Section 9.04; provided, however that the indemnifying party shall be liable
for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party (A) for
any period during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense
thereof or (B) if the Indemnified Party shall reasonably conclude, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that there is a conflict of interest
between the indemnifying party and the Indemnified Party in the conduct of the
defense of such claim. Each party shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause
its affiliates to reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any
Third Party Claim and shall retain and provide upon reasonable request records
and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim and
make employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. If the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance
with and subject to the limitations of this Section 9.04, the indemnifying
party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) before entering into any
settlement of such Third Party Claim; provided, however that consent of the
Indemnified Party shall not be required for any such settlement if (X) such
settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from
all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Third Party Claim
and does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault,
culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party, (Y)
the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
indemnifying party and (Z) such settlement does not permit any order,
injunction or other equitable relief to be entered, directly or indirectly,
against the Indemnified Party. If the indemnifying party does not assume the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to
indemnification hereunder with respect thereto if it has admitted liability
with respect to, or settled, compromised or discharged, such Third Party Claim
without the indemnifying party's prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld).

(k) Limitations on Assumption. The indemnifying party shall not be entitled to
assume or maintain control of the defense of any Third Party Claim and shall
pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (i)
the indemnifying party does not deliver to the Indemnified Party
acknowledgement of such assumption or control within 20 days of receipt of
notice of the Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 9.04(a) (but subject to
the right of the indemnifying party to elect not to continue to assume the
defense of such claim following the Discovery Period), (ii) the Third Party
Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action,
indictment, allegation or investigation, (iii) the Third Party Claim seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or any of its
affiliates (other than claims for injunctive or equitable relief that are
ancillary to a claim for monetary damages) or (iv) the indemnifying party has
failed or is failing to prosecute or defend vigorously the Third Party Claim.

(l) Tax Claims. For the avoidance of doubt, the procedures set forth in this
Section 9.04 shall not apply with regard to Covered Loss relating to Taxes,
for which indemnification provisions are set forth in Article VIII.

(m) Other Claims. In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim
against any indemnifying party under Section 9.02 or 9.03 that does not
involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected
from such Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of
such claim with reasonable promptness to the indemnifying party. Subject to
Section 9.01, the failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify the
indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability
that it may have to such Indemnified Party under Section 9.02 or 9.03, except
to the extent that the indemnifying party demonstrates that it has been
prejudiced by such failure.

(n) Mitigation. Purchaser and the Sellers shall cooperate with each other with
respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party is
obligated to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by making
commercially reasonably efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or
liability. In the event that Purchasers or the Sellers shall fail to make such
commercially reasonably efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or liability,
then notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, the other
party shall not be required to indemnify any person for any Covered Losses to
the extent that such Covered Losses would reasonably be expected to have been
avoided if Purchaser or the Sellers, as the case may be, had made such
efforts.

SECTION 9.05. No Additional Representations.

(e) Purchaser acknowledges that it and its representatives have been permitted
access to the books and records, facilities, equipment, Tax Returns,
Contracts, insurance policies (or summaries thereof) and other properties and
assets of the Business that it and its representatives have desired or
requested to see or review, and that it and its representatives have had a
full opportunity to meet with the Business Employees to discuss the Business.
Purchaser acknowledges that (i) none of the Sellers, the Companies or any
other person has made any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as
to the Business or the accuracy or completeness of any information regarding
the Business furnished or made available to Purchaser and its representatives,
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or the Seller Disclosure
Letter, (ii) Purchaser has not relied on any representation or warranty from
the Sellers or any other person in determining to enter into this Agreement,
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or the Seller Disclosure
Letter, and (iii) none of the Sellers or any other person shall have or be
subject to any liability to Purchaser or any other person resulting from the
distribution to Purchaser, or Purchaser's use of, any such information,
including any information, documents or material made available to Purchaser
in any "data rooms", management presentations or in any other form in
expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser acknowledges
that, should the Closing occur, Purchaser shall acquire the Subject Shares and
the Purchased Assets without any representation or warranty as to
merchantability or fitness of the assets of the Business for any particular
purpose, in an "as is" condition and on a "where is" basis, except as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement or the Seller Disclosure
Letter.

(f) In connection with the investigation by Purchaser of the Companies,
Purchaser has received or may receive from the Companies certain projections,
forward-looking statements and other forecasts and certain business plan
information. Purchaser acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans,
that Purchaser is familiar with such uncertainties, that Purchaser is taking
full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy
of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts or plans), and that Purchaser shall have no claim
against anyone with respect thereto. Accordingly, Purchaser acknowledges that
neither the Companies nor any of the Sellers or Sellers Representatives,
whether in an individual, corporate or any other capacity, make any
representation, warranty, or other statement with respect to, and Purchaser is
not relying on, such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts or plans).

SECTION 9.06. Determination of Loss Amount.

(g) The amount of any and all Covered Losses under this Article IX will be
determined net of (i) any Tax benefits actually realized by any party seeking
indemnification hereunder arising from the deductibility (or amortization or
capitalization or other tax benefit, etc.) of any such Covered Losses and (ii)
any amounts recovered or recoverable by any party or any affiliate of a party
under or pursuant to any insurance policy, title insurance policy, indemnity,
reimbursement arrangement or Contract pursuant to which or under which such
party or such party's affiliates is a party or has rights.

(h) In no event will the Purchaser Indemnitees be entitled to recover or make
a claim for any amounts in respect of consequential, incidental or indirect
damages, lost profits, diminutions in value or punitive damages and, in
particular, no "multiple of profits" or "multiple of cash flow" or other
valuation methodology will be used in calculating the amount of any Covered
Losses (other than for Covered Losses (i) incurred by a Purchaser Indemnitee
in connection with any Third Party Claim or (ii) with respect to any
misrepresentation of or inaccuracy in Section 3.15(g)). Attorney, consultant,
and other professional fees and disbursements incurred by an indemnifying
party in connection with this Article IX will be reasonable and based only on
time actually spent, which will be charged at no more than such professional's
standard hourly rate. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, any Covered Loss claimed hereunder will be in good faith in
light of the facts then known regarding such Covered Loss. Purchaser shall
have no right to assert any claim pursuant to this Article IX with respect to
any Covered Loss, cause of action or other claim to the extent it is a Covered
Loss, cause of action or claim with respect to which Purchaser or any of its
affiliates has taken action (or caused action to be taken) to accelerate the
time period in which such matter is asserted or payable for the purpose of
asserting a claim for indemnification hereunder.

(i) No Purchaser Indemnitee will be entitled to any indemnification under this
Article IX to the extent such matter (i) is taken into account in the
calculation of Final Working Capital or (ii) is reasonably described in the
Seller Disclosure Letter; provided that this Section 9.06(c) shall in no way
limit any indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i)(D).

SECTION 9.07. Adjustments. All payments made pursuant to Articles VIII and IX
shall be treated by the parties hereto on all applicable Tax Returns as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.

SECTION 9.08. Subrogation. After any indemnification payment is made pursuant
to this Article IX, the indemnifying party shall, to the extent of such
payment, be subrogated to all rights (if any) of the Indemnified Party against
any third party in connection with the Covered Losses to which such payment
relates. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any
Indemnified Party receiving an indemnification payment shall execute, upon the
written request of the indemnifying party, any instrument reasonably necessary
to evidence such subrogation rights.

SECTION 9.09. Environmental Indemnification.

(i) Purchaser understands and agrees that (i) each Purchaser Indemnitee's
right to indemnification under Section 9.02(a)(i)(A) for breach of the

sole and exclusive remedy against the Sellers with respect to any
environmental matter arising out of acts occurring or conditions existing on

or operations of the Companies and their predecessors, including any such
matter arising under any Environmental Laws and (ii) no Purchaser Indemnitee
will have the right to indemnification under Section 9.02(a)(i)(A) for breach
of the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.15 (other than
Section 3.15(g)) if the Covered Loss for which such right to indemnification
is an Indemnified Environmental Liability. Except as set forth in this
Agreement, effective at Closing, Purchaser hereby waives any right, whether
arising at law or in equity, to seek contribution, cost recovery, damages, or
any other recourse or remedy from the Sellers, and hereby releases the Sellers
from any claim, demand or liability, in each case with respect to any
environmental matter arising out of acts occurring or conditions existing on
or prior to Closing and relating to the past or current facilities, properties
or operations of the Companies and their predecessors. The Sellers shall have
no obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to Covered
Losses arising from any Contamination to the extent identified as a result of
any environmental sampling or testing after the Closing Date by or on behalf
of any Purchaser Indemnitee unless such sampling or testing is (i) required by
any Environmental Law (including any Environmental Law coming into effect on
or after the Closing) or Governmental Entity, (ii) required by any third party
that is legally entitled to do so, including Boliden, or (iii) incidental to
the operation of the business consistent with the historical operation of the
business and would have been undertaken even in the absence of an indemnity
provided hereunder, including such sampling or testing conducted in connection
with changes to the operation of the business as reflected in Schedule 9.09(a)
or otherwise consistent with the scope and type of historic changes to the
operation of the business. The Sellers' obligation to indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnitees for any Remedial Action pursuant to this Agreement shall be
limited to such Remedial Action (i) already underway as of the Closing Date;
(ii) reasonably necessary to satisfy the requirements of any applicable
Governmental Entity or Environmental Law in effect as of the Closing; (iii)
reasonably necessary to resolve or avoid any investigation, action, claim,
suit or proceeding by or before a Governmental Entity; (iv) reasonably
necessary to mitigate any imminent and substantial threat to human health or
the environment; or (v) reasonably necessary to comply with the terms of any
contractual obligation or take advantage of a right under a contract existing
as of the Closing; and then only to the extent that such Remedial Action is
undertaken in a reasonably cost effective manner, assuming continued
industrial use of the applicable Business Property (and industrial or non-
industrial use, as applicable, of any affected groundwater, sediments,
surrounding properties or other impacted areas) and employing risk-based
standards and institutional controls where available and reasonably
appropriate under the specific circumstances.

(j) The Sellers shall have no liability for indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.02(a)(i)(E) with respect to Indemnified Environmental Liabilities
unless a claim for such Indemnified Environmental Liabilities is asserted
prior to the fifth year anniversary of the Closing Date.

(k) In the event the Sellers make any indemnification payments to any
Purchaser Indemnitee pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i)(A) for any breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.15 (Environmental
Matters) or to Section 9.02(a)(i)(E) for Indemnified Environmental Liabilities
that is reasonably determined to be a result of Contamination existing (i) at
the "Leased Land" (as that term is defined in that certain lease agreement
("Site Lease") dated October 7, 1994 by and between Outokumpu Kokkola Zinc Oy,
Kokkola Chemicals Oy, Outokumpu Metals and Resources Oy and OM Group, Inc., as
amended; and (ii) prior to December 11, 1991 ("Pre-1991 Contamination"), then
Purchaser agrees to cause OMG Kokkola Chemicals to use reasonable good faith
efforts to pursue and exhaust such remedies as are available to it pursuant to
the Site Lease with respect to such Pre-1991 Contamination.



(i) If in connection with the foregoing OMG Kokkola Chemicals recovers any
amounts pursuant to its rights under the Site Lease for damages suffered or
incurred in connection with such Pre-1991 Contamination, then the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall promptly reimburse the Sellers for any indemnity payments
previously made to Purchaser Indemnitees by the Sellers for such Pre-1991
Contamination but only up to such amounts received by OMG Kokkola Chemicals
under the Site Lease, net of any expenses incurred in connection with the
pursuit and recovery of such amounts.

(ii) At any time within 30 days following notice by Purchaser of its
determination to pursue its rights under the Site Lease, the Sellers may at
their election assume the prosecution of OMG Kokkola Chemicals\' enforcement
of the Site Lease pursuant to this Section 9.09(c) with counsel selected by
them reasonably acceptable to Purchaser; provided however that (A) Purchaser
shall have the right to participate in the prosecution thereof and to employ
separate counsel at its own expense, (B) Purchaser shall have the right to
review and approve any significant filings, decisions or settlement agreements
made or entered into in connection with such prosecution, and (C) Purchaser
shall have the right to assume control of such prosecution if the Sellers fail
to prosecute vigorously such remedies as are available under the Site Lease.

(iii) From and after the Closing until the later of (A) the expiration of the
survival period set forth in Section 9.01(a) applicable to the representations
and warranties contained in Section 3.15 (Environmental Matters) or (B) the
satisfaction or other resolution of any indemnification claim pursuant to
Section 3.15 (Environmental Matters) or Section 9.02(a)(i)(E) pending as of
such expiration, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause OMG Kokkola Chemicals to
not, repudiate, impair or limit any right to indemnification available
pursuant to the Site Lease for Contamination.

portion thereof) or the application of any such provision (or any portion

Exhibit A

Article I 
Definitions

SECTION 1.01. Definitions. The following terms, as used herein, have the
following meanings:

"Cobalt Revenue" means, with respect to the Business for any period, the gross
amount of revenue from sales of cobalt products for such period, in arm's
length sales by the Business, excluding (i) all amounts received from resale
of cobalt metal, (ii) all by-product revenue, such as, but not limited to,
copper, nickel and germanium, (iii) all metal additive revenue components of
cobalt products, such as, but not limited to, nickel and manganese and (iv)
all other revenue of the Business. For the avoidance of doubt, cobalt revenue
from tolling, or "recycle", of metal provided by customers and refined at
Kokkola does not include any "pass-through" of metal raw material cost, and
only includes the value-added and applicable premium associated with the
Business's refining and conversion of such products.

"Cobalt Revenue Coefficient" means,

with respect to the First Earn-out Year, the result of (i) the amount, if any,
by which Cobalt Revenue for such Earn-out Year exceeds $420,000,000, divided
by (ii) $80,000,000,

with respect to the Second Earn-out Year, the result of (i) the amount, if
any, by which Cobalt Revenue for such Earn-out Year exceeds $460,000,000,
divided by (ii) $80,000,000, and,

with respect to the Third Earn-out Year, the result of (i) the amount, if any,
by which Cobalt Revenue for such Earn-out Year exceed $500,000,000, divided by
(ii) $70,000,000;

provided that in no event shall the Cobalt Revenue Coefficient for any Earn-
out Year be less than 0 or greater than 1.

"Earn-out Payment" means, with respect to a given Earn-out Year, an amount
equal to (i) $36,666,667, multiplied by (ii) the Cobalt Revenue Coefficient
for such Earn-out Year; provided that if the aggregate Cobalt Revenue for all
three Earn-out Years is at least $1,610,000,000, then, notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this definition, the Earn-out Payment for the Third
Earn-out Year shall be an amount equal to (a) $110,000,000 less (b) the sum of
the Earn-out Payments for the First Earn-out Year and the Second Earn-out
Year.

"Earn-out Year" means any of (i) the First Earn-out Year, (ii) the Second
Earn-out Year and (iii) the Third Earn-out Year.

"Final Cobalt Revenue" means, with respect to a given Earn-out Year, the
Cobalt Revenue for such Earn-out Year (1) as shown in Purchaser's calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 2.01(a) of this Exhibit A, if no notice of
disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to Section
2.01(a) of this Exhibit A or (2) if such a notice of disagreement is
delivered, (a) as agreed by Purchaser and Seller pursuant to Section 2.01(b)
of this Exhibit A or (b) in the absence of such agreement, as shown in the
Accounting Firm's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.01(b) of this
Exhibit A.

"First Earn-out Year" means the period from the beginning of the first month
immediately following the Closing Date to the first anniversary of such date.

"Second Earn-out Year" means the period from the date that is the end of the
First Earn-out Year to the first anniversary of such date.

"Third Earn-out Year" means the period from the date that is the end of the
Second Earn-out Year to the first anniversary of such date.

ARTICLE II 
Earn-out Payments and Procedures

SECTION 2.01. Calculation of Earn-out Payments. (a) As promptly as
practicable, but no later than 30 days, after the end of an Earn-out Year,
Purchaser will cause to be prepared and delivered to the Sellers a certificate
(each, an "Earn-out Certificate") setting forth in reasonable detail
Purchaser's calculation of Cobalt Revenue for such Earn-out Year. If the
Sellers disagree with Purchaser's calculation of Cobalt Revenue for such Earn-
out Year, the Sellers may, within 30 days after delivery of the Earn-out
Certificate, deliver a notice to Purchaser disagreeing with such calculation.
Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to
which the Sellers disagree, and the Sellers shall be deemed to have agreed
with all other items and amounts contained in the Earn-out Certificate. If the
Sellers do not so notify Purchaser of a dispute with respect to the Earn-out
Certificate within such 30-day period, the Earn-out Certificate will be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties.

(b) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section
2.01(a), Purchaser and the Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
such dispute. If Purchaser and the Sellers, notwithstanding such good faith
effort, fail to resolve such dispute within 15 days after the Sellers advise
Purchaser of their objections, then Purchaser and the Sellers jointly shall
engage the Accounting Firm to resolve such dispute. As promptly as
practicable, and in any event not more than 15 days thereafter, Purchaser and
the Sellers shall each prepare and submit a presentation detailing such
party's complete statement of proposed resolution of the dispute to the
Accounting Firm. As soon as practicable thereafter, Purchaser and the Sellers
shall cause the Accounting Firm to choose one of the parties' positions based
solely upon the presentations by Purchaser and the Sellers. The parties shall
share the expenses of the Accounting Firm equally. All determinations made by
the Accounting Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on the parties.

(c) For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this Section 2.01 of
Exhibit A, each party shall cooperate with and make available to the other
party and its representatives all information, records, data and working
papers, and shall permit access to its facilities and personnel, as may be
reasonably required in connection with the preparation and analysis of the
Earn-out Certificate and the resolution of any disputes thereunder (subject to
reasonable confidentiality restrictions and the provision of such assurances,
releases, indemnities or other agreements as accountants may customarily
require in such circumstances).

SECTION 2.02 Earn-out Period Conduct. During the period beginning on the
Closing Date and concluding at the end of the Third Earn-out Year, except as
provided otherwise by the written consent of OMG: (i) Purchaser Guarantor
shall cause the Business to only engage in arm's length sales of cobalt
products and (ii) Purchaser Guarantor shall, and shall cause its affiliates
to, act in good faith and not take any action the purpose of which is avoid or
lessen the payments that would otherwise be required pursuant to this Section
2.02. Subject to the preceding sentence, the parties acknowledge and agree
that OMG Kokkola Chemicals shall have complete discretion with respect to the
marketing and pricing of all of its products and services and, following the
Closing, except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.02, OMG Kokkola
Chemicals shall have the right to operate the Business as it sees fit.

SECTION 2.03. Distribution of Earn-out Payments. (d) As promptly as
practicable, but no later than five business days, after the determination of
Final Cobalt Revenue for a given Earn-out Year, Purchaser shall pay, or shall
cause to be paid, to the Sellers the Earn-out Payment for such Earn-out Year;
provided that such amount shall be reduced in accordance with Article IX for
any claims for indemnification by Purchaser pursuant to Article IX of the
Agreement that are finally determined (either by agreement between the parties
or pursuant to a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction) as of the last day of the given Earn-out Year and that have not
otherwise been satisfied. Each Earn-out Payment shall be paid by or on behalf
of Purchaser in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account of
the Sellers with a bank designated by the Sellers, by notice to Purchaser,
which notice shall be delivered not later than two Business Days following the
determination of Final Cobalt Revenue for a given Earn-out Year (or if not so
designated, then by certified or official bank check payable in immediately
available funds to the order of Seller in such amount).

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, the maximum aggregate amount of Earn-Out
Payments Purchaser and its affiliates shall be obligated to pay pursuant to
this Exhibit A shall be $110,000,000.

(f) The Sellers' right to receive any Earn-out Payment shall not be evidenced
by any form of certificate or instrument and does not represent any ownership
or equity interest in Purchaser, the Business, the Companies, the Subsidiaries
or any of their respective affiliates and does not entitle any Seller to
voting rights or rights to dividend payments.
