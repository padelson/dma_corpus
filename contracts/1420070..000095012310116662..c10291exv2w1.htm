AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement"), is entered into as of
December 27, 2010, by and among ReSearch Pharmaceutical Services, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), Roy RPS Holdings Corp., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), and RPS Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and

herein (including in the immediately preceding sentence) and not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in _Section 8.01_ hereof. 

  

 _RECITALS:_  

   

WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged with and into the
Company, with the Company surviving that merger on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein; 

  

WHEREAS, in the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock") other than (a)
shares of Company Common Stock directly owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, as treasury stock, and (b) the Dissenting Shares, will be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration; 

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Companys Board of
Directors"), acting upon the recommendation of a committee of the Companys
Board of Directors that was formed to consider the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (the "Transaction Committee") has unanimously (a)
determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement with
Parent and Merger Sub, (b) approved the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, and (c) resolved, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, to recommend adoption of this
Agreement by the stockholders of the Company; 

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition

Agreement, Warburg Pincus Private Equity X, L.P. (the "Guarantor") has
provided a guarantee in favor of the Company in the form attached as

    ##### 

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, the
parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER 

   

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), at the Effective Time, (a) Merger Sub
will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger"), and (b) the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue
its corporate existence under the DGCL as the surviving corporation in the
Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). 

  

Section 1.02 _Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place at 10:00
a.m., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania time, as soon as practicable (and, in any
event, within five (5) Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in 
_Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all such conditions), unless this Agreement
has been terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction (or
waiver) of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (not including
conditions that cannot by their nature be satisfied until the Closing but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing),
the Closing shall occur on the earlier of (x) a date during the Marketing
Period specified by Parent on no less than three (3) Business Days notice to
the Company and (y) the third (3rd) Business Day immediately following the
final day of the Marketing Period (subject, in each case, to the satisfaction
or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ for the
Closing as of the date determined pursuant to this proviso); and provided
further, in no event shall the Closing occur prior to the Fiduciary Date. The
Closing shall be held at the offices of Drinker Biddle and Reath LLP, One Logan
Square, Suite 2000, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103, unless another place is
agreed to in writing by the parties hereto, and the actual date of the Closing
is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date." 

  

Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will cause a certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to be executed, acknowledged and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger will become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with, and accepted by,
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later date or time
as may be agreed by the Company and Parent in writing and specified in the
Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL (the effective time of the
Merger being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time"). 

  

Section 1.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the
Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers,
franchises, licenses and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest
in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving
Corporation. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws_. At the Effective Time,
(a) the certificate of incorporation of the Company shall be amended by
virtue of the Merger shall be amended by virtue of the Merger to become the
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and, as so amended, shall be the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the terms thereof or as provided by applicable Law, and (b)
the by-laws of the Company shall be amended by virtue of the Merger to become
the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, which shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the terms thereof, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or as provided by applicable
Law. 

  

Section 1.06 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors
of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation. 

  

Section 1.07 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. 

  

ARTICLE II 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK 

   

Section 2.01 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time,
as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company or the holder of any capital stock of Parent,
Merger Sub or the Company: 

  

(a) Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock. Subject to the provisions of
_Section 2.03_ , each share of Company Common Stock (each, a "Share" and
collectively, the "Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries or the Company (as
treasury stock or otherwise) will automatically be cancelled and will cease
to exist, and no consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor; 

  

(b) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Subject to the provisions of _Section
2.03_, each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than (i) Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section
2.01(a)_, and (ii) Dissenting Shares), shall be cancelled and shall be
converted automatically into the right to receive $6.10 in cash,
without interest (the "Merger Consideration"), subject to any applicable
withholding rights specified in  _Section 2.05_; and 

  

(c) Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

Section 2.02 _Surrender and Payment_. __  

  

(a) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the
"Paying Agent") to act as the agent and enter into an exchange agent
agreement with such Paying Agent for the purpose of exchanging the Merger
Consideration for certificates formerly representing Shares (each, a
"Certificate"). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, cash in an amount sufficient to pay (i) the aggregate Merger
Consideration as required to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.01_; _provided_
, that the Paying Agent shall distribute the funds received by it pursuant to
clauses (ii) and (iii) of this _Section 2.02(a)_ to the Surviving
Corporation to be paid by the Surviving Corporation in accordance with
Section 2.07(a) and Section 2.07(b), (ii) the aggregate Company Stock Option
Consideration due to holders of Company Stock Options as required to be paid
pursuant to _Section 2.07(a)_, and (iii) the aggregate Company Stock Award
Consideration due to holders of Company Stock Awards as required to be paid
pursuant to _Section 2.07(b)_ (collectively, the "Payment Fund"). The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than the payment of the
Merger Consideration and shall not be subject to any claim of Parent under
this Agreement. If the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the aggregate
amounts to which holders of Shares shall be entitled under _Section
2.01(b)_, the holders of Company Stock Options shall be entitled under
_Section 2.07(a),_ and the holders of Company Stock Awards shall be entitled
under _Section 2.07(b)_, Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or
cause the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit in trust additional cash
with the Paying Agent sufficient to make all of the foregoing payments
required under this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
in any event be liable for the payment thereof, and, for the avoidance of
doubt, any losses resulting from investment of the Payment Fund shall not in
any way diminish Parents and Merger Subs obligations to pay in full all
amounts due under this Agreement. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the
Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that: (i) no
such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of Company Common Stock; and (ii) such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or
any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or
P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that
are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from, or interest or
income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, and any amounts in excess of the aggregate amounts
payable pursuant to _Section 2.01_, _2.07(a)_ and _2.07(b)_ shall be
promptly returned to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, in each case as
directed by Parent. Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration. As promptly as practicable
(but in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective
Time), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to send, to each
record holder of Shares at the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal and
instructions (which letter of transmittal and instructions shall be in the
form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company) for use
in such exchange. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_ shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock
represented by a Certificate upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a
Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter
of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the
Paying Agent. Until so surrendered, and subject to the terms set forth in
_Section 2.03_, each such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time,
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash
payable upon the surrender of any Certificate. Upon payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, each
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled,
retired and will cease to exist. 

  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition to such payment that (i) such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and (ii)
the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer
or other Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable. 

  

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificate, and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this _Article II_. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates. 

  

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Shares two (2) years after the Effective Time shall be returned to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, upon demand as directed by Parent, and any
such holder who has not exchanged Shares for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Section 2.02_ prior to that time shall thereafter
look only to Parent, as a general creditor thereof, for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Surviving
Corporation or Company shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any
amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered
prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger
Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately
prior to such time become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

  

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 2.03 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, including _Section 2.01_, Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.01(a)_) and held by a holder who has
not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto
in writing and who has properly demanded (and not withdrawn) appraisal rights
of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares being
referred to collectively as the "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such
holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights
under the DGCL with respect to such Shares) shall not be converted into
a right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be entitled to
only such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or loses such holders right to appraisal pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL,
such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_, without interest thereon. The Company
shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and any
other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL. Parent shall have, at its own expense,
the right to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any such demands, provided such proceedings shall not cause any
delay in the Closing (on the timing specified in  _Section 1.02_). The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make (or cause or permit to be made on its behalf) any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for
payment of fair value of Dissenting Shares prior to the Effective Time. 

  

Section 2.04 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company shall occur (other than the issuance of additional shares of capital
stock of the Company as expressly permitted by this Agreement), including by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including
reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, any
stock dividend or distribution paid in stock or any other similar change
occurring, or with a record date occurring after the date hereof, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted to reflect such change; _provided_ , that nothing
herein shall be construed to permit the Company to take any such action with
respect to its securities that is expressly prohibited by this Agreement. 

  

Section 2.05 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, each of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making
of such payment under any provision of any applicable Tax Law and to pay such
amounts to the appropriate taxing authority. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted, withheld and paid by the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, made such deduction, withholding, and payment. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Section 2.06 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying
Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
the Merger Consideration to be paid (without any interest thereon) in respect
of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate as contemplated under
this  _Article II_. 

   

Section 2.07 _Treatment of Stock Options and Other Stock-based
Compensation_. 

  

(a) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, as of the Effective
Time, each option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company
Stock Option") that is outstanding, vested and exercisable immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of that
Company Stock Option or any other Person, cancelled and converted into the
right to receive from Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by
(y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share
exercise price under such Company Stock Option (such amount, the "Company
Stock Option Consideration"); _provided_ , that if the exercise price
per share of any such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without
any cash payment being made in respect thereof. Each Company Stock Option
that is outstanding as of the Effective Time but is not then vested
and exercisable (and is not contractually entitled to accelerated vesting as
of the Effective Time) shall be, as of the Effective Time, exchanged for a
number of options to acquire equity securities of the Parent or an Affiliate
of Parent having an aggregate intrinsic value equal to the value of such
Company Stock Option. 

  

(b) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, as of the Effective
Time, each restricted stock award and other right, contingent or accrued, to
acquire or receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured by the
value of such shares, and each award of any kind consisting of shares of
Company Common Stock that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable
or reserved for issuance under any Company stock award plan, other than
Company Stock Options (each, a "Company Stock Award") immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of that Company Stock Award or any other
Person, cancelled and converted into the right to receive from Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of such
Company Stock Award multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration (reduced, if
applicable, by any exercise or base price applicable to such Company Stock
Award; the "Company Stock Award Consideration");  _provided_ that if the
exercise price per share of any such Company Stock Award is equal to or
greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Award shall be
cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, its board of directors and
the compensation committee of such board, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions (including obtaining any employee consents,
but which shall not include the payment of money or other consideration other
than as provided herein) that may be necessary to effectuate the provisions
of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this _Section 2.07_.

a whole).

or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or significant impediments

position through merger or acquisition ("Foreign Antitrust Laws" and,

such opinion will be delivered to Parent solely for informational purposes
promptly after the date hereof. The Company has obtained the authorization of

management and the Companys Board of Directors, and (3) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
the Companys and its Subsidiaries assets that could have a material effect
on the Companys financial statements. 

  

(ii) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that all material information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that
all such material information is accumulated and communicated to the
Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive
officer and chief financial officer of the Company required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports. The Companys executive management
has certified that it has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of
such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the date of the

2010, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Companys

design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that could
adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information, and (2) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial
reporting. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms "significant deficiency"

Subsidiaries has any Liabilities of the type required to be reflected on a

Liability required to be reflected on a balance sheet prepared in accordance
with GAAP) contained in the Company SEC Documents, (ii) were incurred since

shall exercise, consistent with the terms of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over their respective businesses, assets, and operations.

Section 5.04 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. 

  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the
terms set forth in _Article VII_, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Parents Representatives (including
financing sources and their respective Representatives), upon reasonable prior
notice, reasonable access during normal business hours and in a manner as
shall not unreasonably interfere with the business or operations of the
Company or any Subsidiary thereof, to the officers, employees, accountants,
agents, properties, offices and other facilities and to all books,
records, contracts and other assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to
Parent such other information concerning the business and properties of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably request from time to
time. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or disclose information pursuant to this _Section 5.04(a)_
to the extent that the Company has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that such access or disclosure
would jeopardize the protection of attorney-client privilege or contravene any
Law (it being agreed that the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts
to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not result in
such jeopardy or contravention). 

  

(b) Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under

Section 5.05 _No Solicitation_. 

  

(a) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall
not authorize or permit its and its Subsidiaries Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, members, advisors, agents, representatives and
investment bankers (with respect to any Person, the foregoing Persons are
referred to herein as such Persons "Representatives") to, directly or
indirectly, solicit, initiate, or knowingly take any action to facilitate or
encourage the submission or making of any Takeover Proposal or, subject to
_Section 5.05(b)_, (i) conduct or engage in any discussions or negotiations
with, disclose any non-public information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to, afford access to the business, properties, assets, books
or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or knowingly assist,
participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by, any third party that
is seeking to make, or has made, any Takeover Proposal, (ii) (A) amend or
grant any waiver (except a waiver of the standstill provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement) or release under any standstill or similar
agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or (B) approve any transaction under, or any third
party becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section 203 of the DGCL, or
(iii) enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract relating to any Takeover
Proposal (each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement"). The Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to cease immediately and cause to be terminated,
and shall not authorize or knowingly permit any of its or their
Representatives to continue, any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations, if any, with any third party conducted prior to the date hereof
with respect to any Takeover Proposal. The Company shall deliver a written
notice to each such third party to the effect that the Company is ending all
discussions and negotiations with such Person with respect to any Takeover
Proposal, effective on the date hereof, and the notice shall also request
such Person to promptly return or destroy all confidential
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries, subject to the terms
of any confidentiality agreement between the Company and such Person. 

  

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.05(a)_, prior to the Fiduciary Date, the
Companys Board of Directors, directly or indirectly through any
Representative, may, subject to _Section 5.05(c)_ and _Section 5.05(d)_ (i)
participate in negotiations or discussions with any third party that has made
(and not withdrawn) a bona fide, unsolicited Takeover Proposal after the date
hereof in writing, and (ii) thereafter furnish to such third party non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an
executed confidentiality agreement that constitutes an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, in a manner consistent with the Companys past
practice in dealing with the disclosure of commercially sensitive non-
public information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the context
of evaluating Takeover Proposals prior to the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , that the Company will promptly provide, in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to such other Person which
was not previously provided to Parent, but in each case referred to in the
foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), only if (1) the Companys Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with 

  

    ##### 

  

   

its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the
members of the Board of Directors to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law, (2) the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to
lead to a Superior Proposal and (3) such Takeover Proposal is not a result of
the Companys or any of its Representatives breach of _Section 5.05(a)_.
Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Companys Board of Directors from
disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9
and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a
Takeover Proposal, if the Company determines, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that failure to disclose such position would
reasonably be expected to constitute a violation of applicable Law. 

  

(c) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall, within one (1) Business
Day notify Parent in writing if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives receives any Takeover Proposal or any request to engage in
negotiation that could reasonably be expected to result in a Takeover
Proposal, in each case, including the identity of the Person making
such Takeover Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such Takeover
Proposal or potential Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a current and timely basis of any changes to the
financial terms, conditions or other material terms of such
Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company shall provide to Parent, as soon as practicable and in any event
within one (1) Business Day after receipt or delivery thereof, copies of all
draft agreements (and any other written material to the extent such
written material contains any financial terms, conditions or other material
terms of any Takeover Proposal) sent by or provided to the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their Representatives in connection with
such Takeover Proposal. The Company shall also promptly notify Parent of
any breach, of which the Company has Knowledge, of any existing standstill
agreement with any third party by the counterparty thereto, or any request by
any third party to waive, release or otherwise exempt such third party under
any standstill agreement. 

  

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.05(d)_, the Companys Board of
Directors shall not authorize or enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to
enter into) a Company Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence but subject to compliance with _Section 5.05(b)_ and _Section
5.05(c)_, at anytime prior to the Fiduciary Date, the Companys Board of
Directors may enter into (or permit any Subsidiary to enter into) a Company
Acquisition Agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal only if (i) (A) the
Company promptly notifies Parent, in writing, at least four (4) Business Days
(the "Notice Period") before authorizing or entering into (or causing or
authorizing a Subsidiary to enter into) such Company Acquisition Agreement,
of its intention to take such action with respect to a Superior Proposal,
which notice shall state expressly that the Company has received a Takeover
Proposal that the Companys Board of Directors intends to declare a Superior
Proposal and, absent any change to terms and conditions of this Agreement,
that the Companys Board of Directors intends to authorize the Company to
enter into such Company Acquisition Agreement, (B) the Company attaches to
such notice the most current version of the proposed Company Acquisition
Agreement (which version shall, if amended or revised, be updated on a prompt
basis and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours of such amendment
or update) and discloses the identity of the third party making such Superior
Proposal, and (C) the Company uses (and 

  

    ##### 

  

   

causes it Subsidiaries to use) its reasonable best efforts to cause its and
its Subsidiaries Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate
with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Takeover Proposal ceases
to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to
make such adjustments, and permit Parent and its Representatives, during the
Notice Period, to make a presentation to the Companys Board of Directors
regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the
extent Parent desires to make such presentation); _provided_ , that in the
event of any material revisions to the financial terms, conditions or other
material terms of the Takeover Proposal that the Companys Board of Directors
has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall deliver a new
written notice to Parent, a new Notice Period shall commence, and the Company
and Parent shall comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.05(d)_ with
respect to such new written notice; (ii) the Companys Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisors) that such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal after taking into account any adjustments made by Parent
during any applicable Notice Period(s) in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement; and (iii) at the time the Company is permitted to terminate, and
terminates, this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.04(a)_, the Company shall
pay any amounts due pursuant to _Section 7.06(b)_ hereof in accordance with
the terms, and at the times, specified therein. 

   

Section 5.06 _Information Statement; Merger Consent_. 

  

(a) The Company shall, in accordance with the DGCL and the Companys Charter
Documents, take all action necessary to seek and obtain the Requisite Company
Vote by written consent of the stockholders of the Company in the form
attached as _Exhibit B_ (the "Merger Consent") and deliver the Merger
Consent to Parent no more than one (1) Business Day after the execution of
this Agreement. The Merger Consent shall automatically terminate upon, and be
of no further force and effect from and after, any termination of this
Agreement. The Company shall comply with the DGCL, the Companys Charter
Documents, and the Exchange Act (including Regulation 14C and Schedule
14C promulgated under the Exchange Act) in connection with the Merger
Consent, including (i) preparing and delivering the Information Statement to
the Companys stockholders as required pursuant to the Exchange Act and
_Section 5.06(b)_ and providing a description of the appraisal rights
of holders of Company Common Stock available under Section 262 of the DGCL,
and (ii) giving prompt notice of the taking of the actions described in the
Merger Consent in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL to all holders of
Company Common Stock not executing the Merger Consent. 

  

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file the Information Statement with
the SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable (and after consultation with Parent) to any comments
made by the SEC with respect to the Information Statement and to cause
the Information Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as
promptly as practicable after confirmation from the SEC that it has no
further comments on the Information Statement (or that the Information
Statement is otherwise not to be reviewed by the SEC). Parent and Merger
Sub shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the
Information Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish the Company with the information
relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Information Statement. Prior 

  

    ##### 

  

   

to the filing with the SEC, or the mailing to the Companys stockholders, of
the Information Statement, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and reasonably comment on, and the Company shall
consider all reasonable comments proposed by Parent with respect to, the
Information Statement. The Company shall notify Parent reasonably promptly of
the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by
the SEC or its staff for any amendments or supplements to the
Information Statement. The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and reasonably comment on any such comments or requests
from the SEC or its staff and the Company shall reasonably consider all
comments proposed by Parent in connection with any filings with the SEC or its
staff in response thereto, and if required, the Company shall mail to its
stockholders, as promptly as reasonably practicable, such amendment or
supplement. If required by applicable Law, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agree to correct any information provided by it for use in
the Information Statement which shall have become false or misleading and the
Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders an amendment or
supplement setting forth such correction. 

  

Section 5.07 _Notices of Certain Events_. The Company shall notify Parent and
Merger Sub in writing, and Parent and Merger Sub shall notify the Company in
writing, promptly of (i) any notice or other communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the failure to
have such consent would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
party receiving such communication to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any material notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) any Legal Actions
commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, that are related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement ("Transaction Litigation"), and (iv) the occurrence or the non-
occurrence of any event, condition, change or effect between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time which causes or is reasonably likely to
cause the failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.02(a)_,
_Section 6.02(b)_ or _Section 6.02(c)_ of this Agreement (in the case of the
Company and its Subsidiaries) or _Section 6.03(a)_ or _Section 6.03(b)_ of
this Agreement (in the case of Parent and Merger Sub), to be satisfied. The
failure to comply with this _Section 5.07_ will not, in and of itself,
constitute the failure of the condition set forth in _Section 6.02(b)_ or
_Section 6.03(b)_, as the case may be, unless such failure to
comply materially prejudices the other partys ability to exercise its rights
or remedies under this Agreement prior to Closing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.07_ shall not
cure any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant for any purpose
under this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies
available hereunder to any party hereto. 

  

Section 5.08 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall control the
defense, settlement and/or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation;
_provided_ , that the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed with
respect to the status of such Transaction Litigation and shall reasonably

Transaction Litigation.

(a) For a period of not less than one (1) year following the Effective Time,
the employees of the Company who remain in the employment of the Surviving
Corporation (the "Company Continuing Employees") shall receive salaries and
employee benefits (other than any equity-based benefits) that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to similarly-situated employees of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

  

(b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, excluding both any
retiree healthcare plans or programs maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries and any equity compensation arrangement maintained by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Parent Benefit Plans") in which any
Company Continuing Employees will participate effective as of the Effective
Time or later, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
recognize all service of the Company Continuing Employees with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for vesting and
eligibility purposes (but not for (i) purposes of early retirement subsidies
under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan or (ii)
benefit accrual purposes, except for vacation, if applicable); _provided_ ,
that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that (x) such
recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or (y) such service was
not recognized under the corresponding Company Employee Plan. 

  

(c) With respect to any Parent Benefit Plan that is a medical, dental, vision
or prescription benefit plan in which any Company Continuing Employees will
participate effective in the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the insurer or
third-party administrator of such Parent Benefit Plan (i) to waive for the
plan year in which the Closing occurs all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Company Continuing Employees to the
extent waived or satisfied under the corresponding Company Employee Plan as
of the Closing Date, and (ii) to provide each Company Continuing Employee with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date in
the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of satisfying any
applicable co-payment or deductible requirements under any such Parent
Benefit Plan in the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs. 

  

(d) This _Section 5.09_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section
5.09_, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
_Section 5.09_. Nothing contained herein, express or implied (i) shall
be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement or arrangement or (ii) shall alter or limit the ability of
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
terms set forth in this _Section 5.09_ shall not create any right in any
Company Employee or any other Person to any continued employment or any term
or condition of employment with the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any
of their respective Subsidiaries. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(e) With respect to matters described in this _Section 5.09_, the Company
will not send any written notices or other written communication materials to
Company Employees without the prior written consent of Parent. 

   

Section 5.10 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor
of each Person who is now, or has been at any time since February 1, 2006 or
who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (each an "Indemnified Party") as provided in the
Companys Charter Documents, in each case as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, or pursuant to any other Contracts in effect on the date hereof
and set forth on _Section 5.10_ of the Companys Disclosure Schedule
(collectively, the "Indemnification Documents"), shall be assumed by
the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, without further action, at the
Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms, and, in the event that any
proceeding is pending or asserted or any claim made during such period,
until the final disposition of such proceeding or claim. 

  

(b) For the greater of six (6) years after the Effective Time or, with respect
to any Indemnified Party that is party to an Indemnification Document, the
maximum period under which rights to indemnification are provided under such
Indemnification Document, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law and on the terms and conditions set forth in the
applicable Indemnification Document, the Surviving Corporation (the
"Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees,
expenses, judgments and fines arising in whole or in part out of actions or
omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), and shall promptly reimburse each Indemnified Party for any legal
or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in
connection with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments and fines as such expenses are
incurred, subject to the Surviving Corporations receipt of an undertaking by
such Indemnified Party to repay such legal and other fees and expenses paid
in advance if it is ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to be indemnified under applicable Law or under the terms and
conditions set forth in the applicable Indemnification Document; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Surviving Corporation will not be liable for any
settlement effected without the Surviving Corporations prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

  

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to obtain as of the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with
a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time with at least the
same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are not
less advantageous, in the aggregate, to the directors and officers of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case with respect to claims arising
out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time
(including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement). The Company shall have a reasonable period of time to review and
approve such "tail" insurance policies. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 5.10_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party to whom this _Section 5.10_ applies without the consent of
such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that
the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.10_ applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.10_, each of whom may enforce the
provisions of this _Section 5.10_), unless such modification is required by
applicable Law. 

  

(e) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, set
forth in this _Section 5.10_. The agreements and covenants contained herein
shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which any
Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract or
otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and

Section 5.11 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement
(including those contained in this _Section 5.11_), each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, and
to satisfy all conditions within such partys control to, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary permits,
waivers, consents, approvals and actions or non-actions from Governmental
Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including
filings with Governmental Entities) and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action
or proceeding by, any Governmental Entities, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary material consents or waivers from third parties, and (iii) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Parent will
take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to cause Merger Sub to consummate the Merger on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall,
subject to applicable Law, promptly (x) cooperate and coordinate with the
other in the taking of the actions contemplated by clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) immediately above and (y) supply the other with any information that
may be reasonably required in order to effectuate the taking of such actions
(provided that each party may, at its discretion, impose reasonable
safeguards to prevent the disclosure of competitively-sensitive information
of such party to the other party). Each party hereto shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, promptly inform the other party or parties
hereto, as the case may be, of any communication from any 

  

    ##### 

   

   

Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. If the Company or Parent receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then it
shall use its reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon
as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party,
an appropriate response in compliance with such request, and, if permitted by
applicable Law and by any applicable Governmental Entity, provide the other
partys counsel with advance notice and the opportunity to attend and
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any filing made thereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Neither Parent nor the Company shall commit to or agree (or
permit their respective Subsidiaries to commit to or agree) with any
Governmental Entity to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws, without the
prior written consent of the other (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to _Section
5.11(a)_ hereof, the parties hereto shall (i) provide or cause to be provided
as promptly as reasonably practicable to Governmental Entities with
jurisdiction over the Antitrust Laws (each such Governmental Entity, a
"Governmental Antitrust Authority") information and documents requested
by any Governmental Antitrust Authority as necessary, proper or advisable to
permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including preparing and filing any notification and report form and related
material required under the HSR Act and any additional consents and filings
under any other Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable following the date
of this Agreement ( _provided_ that in the case of the filing under the HSR
Act, such filing shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of the date of
this Agreement and all filing fees in connection therewith shall be borne
solely by Parent) and thereafter to respond as promptly as practicable to any
request for additional information or documentary material that may be made
under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws and (ii) subject to
the terms set forth in _Section 5.11(c)_ hereof, use their reasonable best
efforts to take such actions as are necessary or advisable to obtain prompt
approval of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by any Governmental Entity or expiration of applicable waiting
periods. 

  

(c) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or
private party challenging the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, or any other agreement contemplated hereby, the parties shall
cooperate in all respects and shall each use its reasonable best efforts
to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates shall be required to defend,
contest or resist any action or proceeding, whether judicial or
administrative, or to take any action to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Order, in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to, and

subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action
with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding,
agreement or order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, (ii) conduct, restrict, operate,

Section 5.12 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in the form
attached hereto as  _Exhibit C_ (the "Initial Press Release"). From the date
hereof and thereafter, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that
no public release or announcement concerning the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent of the
Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except (i) for such release or announcement may be permitted by the
last sentence of _Section 5.05(b)_, (ii) if a party hereto determines in
good faith (after consultation with its legal counsel) that such release or
announcement is required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of
any applicable United States securities exchange or Governmental Entity to
which the relevant party is subject, wherever situated, in which case the
party required to make the release or announcement shall consult with the
other party about, and allow the other party reasonable time to comment
on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, or (iii) for the
Initial Press Release. If and to the extent that this _Section 5.12_
conflicts with the Confidentiality Agreement, this _Section 5.12_ shall
control in all respects. 

  

Section 5.13 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "control share acquisition," "fair
price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then each of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, and their respective board of directors shall grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such
anti-takeover Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

(a) Upon request of Parent, the Company shall provide and shall cause its

Financing to evaluate the Companys and its Subsidiaries cash management
and accounting systems for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements, and establishing bank and other accounts and blocked account
agreements and lock box arrangements in connection with the foregoing (
_provided_ that such accounts, agreements and arrangements should not
become active or take effect until the Effective Time); and (v) assisting
Parent in obtaining payoff letters and termination statements as may be
reasonably requested by Parent to extinguish indebtedness of the Company and
security interests related thereto; _provided_ , that such requested
cooperation and assistance does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
business of the Company. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary shall be
required to pay any commitment fee or similar fee or incur any liability
(other than costs and expenses that are reimbursable pursuant to this
_Section 5.14(a)_) with respect to the Debt Financing. Parent shall, promptly
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with the cooperation required by this Section. The Company hereby
consents to the use of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Debt Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is
not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or its
Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is
understood and agreed by the parties hereto that the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.02(b)_ , as applied to the Companys obligations under this
_Section 5.14(a)_, shall be deemed to be satisfied unless the Debt Financing
has not been obtained as a direct result of the Companys Willful Breach of
its obligations under this _Section 5.14(a)_. Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Representatives from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (including any action
that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are obligated or requested
by Parent or any of its Representatives to take in accordance with this
_Section 5.14(a)_) and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than historical information relating to Company or its Subsidiaries
provided by the Company in writing specifically for use in the Debt Financing
offering documents). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, but subject to the expiration of the Marketing Period, Parents
obtaining the Debt Financing is not a condition to the obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or to perform their respective obligations
hereunder. 

  

(b) For the end of each month during the period beginning with the month of
January 2011 and ending on the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to

Section 7.06 _Fees and Expenses_. 

  

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.03(a)_

(by wire transfer of immediately available funds), within five (5) Business

this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VII_, the Company or any
of its Affiliates enters into a definitive agreement in connection with such
Takeover Proposal which is subsequently consummated or consummates a

the Company shall pay Parents designee(s), on the date such transaction in
connection with a Takeover Proposal is consummated, the Termination Fee (less
the amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.06(d)_, if any) (by wire transfer of immediately available
funds). For the purpose of this _Section 7.06(c)_, all references in the
term Takeover Proposal to "15% or more" will be deemed to be references

    ##### 

  

  

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
7.03(b)_ in connection with a Willful Breach on the part of the Company and
the Termination Fee is not then payable pursuant to _Section 7.06(c)_, then
the Company shall, following receipt of an invoice therefor, promptly (in any
event within two (2) Business Days) pay all of Parents out-of-pocket fees
and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) actually incurred
by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Financing) (the "Parent Expenses"), which amount shall in no event exceed
$3,000,000 in the aggregate, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or
more accounts designated by Parent; _provided_ , that the existence
of circumstances which could require the Termination Fee to become
subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.06(c)_ shall not
relieve the Company of its obligations to pay Parent Expenses pursuant to
this _Section 7.06(d)_; _provided_ , _further_ , that the payment by the
Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section 7.06(d)_ shall
not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Termination
Fee, except that the Termination Fee shall be reduced by the amount of any
Parent Expenses previously paid to Parent pursuant to this _Section
7.06(d)_, if any. 

  

(e) Each party acknowledges and agrees that (i) the provisions of this
_Section 7.06_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger), and that, without such provisions, Parent
and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement and (ii) the
damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where
a Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate
calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to _Section
7.06(a)_, _Section 7.06(b)_, or _Section 7.06(c)_ are not a penalty but
rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate Parent for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. 

  

(f) If the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to _Section
7.06_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in
_Section 7.06_ or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent, the
costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by Parent and
its Affiliates in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
payment amount at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made through the date of payment. The parties

Section 8.02 _Interpretation; Construction_. 

  

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference
shall be to a Section of, Exhibit to or Schedule of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." A reference in this Agreement to $ or
dollars is to U.S. dollars. The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and
words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to
this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. References to "this Agreement" shall include the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Where specific language is used to clarify by example a
general statement contained herein, such specific language shall not be
deemed to modify, limit or restrict in any manner the construction of the
general statement to which it relates. To the extent that this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take or omit to take any action prior
to Closing, such agreement includes the obligation of the Company to
cause such Subsidiary to take or omit to take such actions. 

  

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. 

  

(c) All agreements and covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect
so that if a certain action constitutes a default under a certain agreement
or covenant, the fact that such action is not prohibited by another agreement
or covenant shall not affect the occurrence of such default; _provided_ ,
that the taking of any action that is expressly permitted or required by an
agreement or covenant (so long as such action is taken in accordance with such
express provisions) set forth herein shall not constitute a default under any
other covenant or agreement set forth herein. In addition, all
representations and warranties hereunder shall be given independent effect so
that if a particular representation or warranty proves to be incorrect or
is breached, the fact that another representation or warranty concerning the
same or similar subject matter is correct or is not breached will not affect
the incorrectness of or a breach of a representation and warranty
hereunder. 

  

Section 8.03 _Survival_. None of the representations and warranties contained
in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered under this Agreement will
survive the Effective Time. This Section 8.03 does not limit any covenant of
the parties to this Agreement which, by its terms, contemplates performance
after the Effective Time. The Confidentiality Agreement will (a)
survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (b)
terminate as of the Effective Time. 

  

Section 8.04 _Governing Law_. All issues and questions concerning the
construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement,
whether in contract, tort, equity or otherwise, shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to contracts made and performed in the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of Laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of
Delaware. Any claims alleged against any Parent Financing Sources in
connection with the Debt Financing shall be governed by New York law.

Section 8.05 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this

the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by the other

matter jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, in the United States

that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action or
proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 8.07_ or in such other manner

generally and unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any

hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion,
as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with
respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder,
or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this
Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder (i) any claim that

for any reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with
this _Section 8.05_, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise), and (iii) to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (x) the suit, action or
proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue
of such suit, action or proceeding is improper, or (z) this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties hereto
agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law
or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Parent
Financing Sources in connection with the Debt Financing hereby in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of any
commitment relating to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New
York (Borough of Manhattan) or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction
is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof). 

  

Section 8.06 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY

RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT,
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE GUARANTEE. EACH PARTY
TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF

ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C)
SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED

Section 8.08 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits to
this Agreement), the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties to this
Agreement with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. In the event
of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this Agreement,
the Confidentiality Agreement and the Company Disclosure Schedule (other than
an exception expressly set forth as such in the Company Disclosure Schedule),
the statements in the body of this Agreement will control. 

  

Section 8.09 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except (a) for the rights of the
holders of the Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options and Company Stock
Awards to receive the Merger Consideration, the Company Stock Option
Consideration and Company Stock Award Consideration pursuant to _Article
II_, (b) prior to the Effective Time, for the right of the holders of the

Parents designee(s) provided in _Section 7.06_, this Agreement is for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person or entity any legal or equitable right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement. The rights granted pursuant to clause (b) of this _Section
8.09_ shall only be enforceable on behalf of the holders of Company Common
Stock, Company Stock Options and Company Stock Awards by the Company in its
sole and absolute discretion, as agent for such holders, it being understood
and agreed that any and all interests in such claims shall attach to such
Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options and Company Stock Awards and
subsequently transfer therewith and, consequently, any damages, settlements
or other amounts recovered or received by the Company with respect to such
claims (net of expenses incurred by the Company in connection therewith)
may, in the Companys sole and absolute discretion, be (i) distributed, in
whole or in part, by the Company to the holders of Company Common Stock,
Company Stock Options and Company Stock Awards as of any date determined by
the Company or (ii) retained by the Company for the use and benefit of the
Company on behalf of its stockholders in any manner the Company deems fit.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) any Parent Financing
Sources in connection with the Debt Financing shall be express third party
beneficiaries of and shall be entitled to rely upon  _Section 8.13(c)_,
_Section 8.04_, _Section 8.05_, _Section 8.06_ and  _Section 8.09_
hereof, and each such Parent Financing Sources and its successors and
assigns may enforce such provisions and (ii) _Sections 8.13(c)_, _Section
8.04_, _Section 8.05_ , _Section 8.06_ and _Section 8.09_ hereof (and the
related definitions and other provisions of this Agreement to the extent a
modification or waiver or termination thereof would serve to modify the
substance or provisions of such Sections) may not be modified, waived
or terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect to any
such Parent Financing Sources without the prior written consent of such Debt
Financing Sources 

  

Section 8.10 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision
of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or
provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 8.11 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
Parent and/or Merger Sub may assign this Agreement (in whole but not in
part) without the consent of any other party hereto (i) to any of its
Affiliates, (ii) to any parties providing the Financing pursuant to the terms
thereof (including for purposes of creating a security interest herein or to
otherwise assign as collateral in respect of such Financing) or (iii) to any
third party who subsequently purchases all or substantially all of the assets
of Parent. No assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its
obligations hereunder. 

  

Section 8.12 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement and subject to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter or the
Guarantee, any and all remedies expressly conferred upon a party to this
Agreement will be cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy
contained in this Agreement, at Law or in equity. The exercise by a party to
this Agreement of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise by it of any
other remedy. 

   

Section 8.13 _Specific Performance_. __  

  

(a) Subject to _Section 8.13(b)_ and subject to the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letter or the Guarantee, the parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or in
the event (but only in the event) that such court does not have subject
matter jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, in the United States
Federal Court for the District of Delaware (including the Companys obligation
to consummate the Merger, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law
or in equity. Subject to _Section 8.13(b)_, the parties hereto hereby waive
(i) any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the
defense that a remedy at law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under
any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief. If Parent and/or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the
Company, on the other hand, brings any Legal Action to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by the other party(ies),
the End Date shall automatically be extended by (x) the amount of time during
which such Legal Action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days or (y)
such other time period established by the Delaware court presiding over such
Legal Action. 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.13_, the
parties hereby acknowledge and agree that in the event that the Termination
Fee becomes payable, the Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article
VII_ and the Termination Fee is paid in full by the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.06_, the Termination Fee shall be Parents and Merger Subs sole
and exclusive remedy under this Agreement and neither Parent nor Merger Sub
shall have any right to bring any Legal Action for specific performance or
any other Legal Action pursuant to this _Section 8.13_. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company (and each of
its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or agents other than Parent
and Merger Sub) shall not have any rights or claims against any debt
financing source (which term does not include Guarantor, Parent or any of
their respective Affiliates ("Parent Financing Sources")) in connection with
the Debt Financing, and any such Parent Financing Sources shall not have any
rights or claims against the Company (or any of its Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees or agents other than Parent and Merger Sub), in
connection with this Agreement or the Debt Financing, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; provided that, following
consummation of the Merger, the foregoing will not limit the rights of the
parties to the Debt Financing under any commitment letter related thereto. 

  

Section 8.14 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, all of which will be one and the same agreement.
This Agreement will become effective when each party to this Agreement will
have received counterparts signed by all of the other parties. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or by
