this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, following the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the
Offer, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company, with the
Company continuing as the Surviving Corporation (the " _Merger_ "), in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), whereby each issued and outstanding Share (other than (i) Shares
to be cancelled or converted in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and (ii)
Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price;

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser and
certain stockholders of the Company (the " _Principal Stockholders_ ") are
entering into support agreements, each of even date herewith (the " _Support
Agreements_ "), pursuant to which such stockholders have agreed, among other
things, to tender their Shares in the Offer;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously
(i) determined that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders, (ii) approved and declared advisable this
Agreement and the Support Agreements and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including the Offer and the Merger, and (iii) recommended
that the Companys stockholders accept the Offer, tender their Shares to the
Purchaser in the Offer and, to the extent

  

   

     
   

  



  

applicable, adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Purchaser has, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
without limitation the Offer and the Merger, and the Parent or a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (in each case, in its capacity as the sole stockholder
of Purchaser) has adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; and

  



  

WHEREAS, Parent, the Purchaser and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Offer
and the Merger.

  



  

 **AGREEMENT**

  

 ** **

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to
this Agreement agree as follows:

  



  

 ** _ARTICLE 1_** 


  

 **THE OFFER AND THE MERGER**

  

 ** **

  

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

  



  

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 7.1, and none of the events or conditions in clause (c) of
_Annex I_ shall have occurred and be continuing, as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof (but in no event later than eleven (11) Business Days
after the date of the initial public announcement of this Agreement), the
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to, commence, within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "
_Exchange Act_ "), the Offer.

  



  

(b) Subject to (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not
properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number of Shares which,
together with the number of Shares, if any, then owned of record by Parent or
the Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or the Purchaser otherwise has,
directly or indirectly, sole voting power, represents at least a majority of
all outstanding Shares (determined on a Fully Diluted Basis) entitled to vote
(A) in the election of directors or (B) upon the adoption of this Agreement
and approval of the Merger, on the date Shares are accepted for
payment (collectively, the " _Minimum Condition_ "); and (ii) the
satisfaction or waiver by Parent or the Purchaser of the other conditions and
requirements set forth in _Annex I_ , the Purchaser shall, and Parent shall
cause the Purchaser to, accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as
practicable after the Purchaser is legally permitted to do so under
applicable Law (the date and time of acceptance for payment, the "
_Acceptance Time_ "). Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to
Purchaser on a timely basis funds sufficient to purchase and pay for any
and all Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to accept for payment and
purchase pursuant to

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

the Offer. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the
holder of such Share in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of
Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with Section 2.2(e).

  



  

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in
accordance with this Agreement, including the conditions and requirements set
forth in _Annex I_. Parent and the Purchaser expressly reserve the right to
increase the Offer Price, waive any condition to the Offer (except the
Minimum Condition) or to make any other changes in the terms and
conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that unless previously
approved by the Company in writing, the Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the
Offer Price payable in the Offer, (ii) change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the maximum number of Shares to be
purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or waive the Minimum Condition, (v) amend
or modify the other conditions set forth in _Annex I_ in a manner adverse
to the holders of Shares, (vi) extend the Expiration Date other than
in accordance with this Agreement, or (vii) amend any other term of the
Offer which is adverse to the holders of Shares.

  



  

(d) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, unless extended in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at 12:00
midnight (Eastern time) on the date (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") that
is twenty (20) Business Days following the commencement of the Offer or, if
the Offer has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, at the time
and date to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration
Date, or such later time and date to which the Offer has been extended in
accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").

  



  

(e) Purchaser may, without the consent of the Company, if on or prior to any
then scheduled Expiration Date any of the conditions of the Offer are not
satisfied or waived, extend the Offer for such period as the Purchaser
determines, _provided_  that such extension shall be in increments of not
more than ten (10) Business Days if all of the conditions set forth on _Annex
I_ other than the Minimum Condition have been satisfied or waived at such
Expiration Date. In addition, if on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration
Date, any of the conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or, to the
extent waivable by the Parent or the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement,
waived by Parent or the Purchaser, subject to Parents rights in Article
7, the Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to, extend the
Offer for successive periods of up to ten (10) Business Days each, the length
of each such period to be determined by the Purchaser in its sole discretion,
in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer
beyond the Termination Date; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Purchaser
shall not be required to extend the Offer after the Company delivers, or is
required to deliver, to Parent a notice with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal that has been received by the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any
Company Representative, in accordance with Section 5.4, except to the extent
that prior to the then scheduled Expiration Date (i) the Acquisition Proposal
giving rise to such notice has been withdrawn or the Company Board has
rejected the Acquisition Proposal giving rise to such notice, (ii) the
Company Board has reconfirmed the Company Board Recommendation, and (iii) the
withdrawal or rejection of such Acquisition Proposal and the reconfirmation
of the Company Board Recommendation shall have been publicly announced by the
Company. In addition, the

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

Purchaser shall extend the then scheduled Expiration Date for any period or
periods required by applicable Law or applicable rules, regulations,
interpretations or positions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "
_SEC_ ") or its staff or the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ").

  



  

(f) If necessary to obtain sufficient Shares to reach the Short Form
Threshold (without regard to Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that
have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee),
the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, provide for a "subsequent offering
period" (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Offer, the Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause the
Purchaser to, immediately accept for payment, and pay for, all Shares that
are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer during such "subsequent offering
period". The Offer Documents shall provide for the possibility of a
"subsequent offering period" in a manner consistent with the terms of this
Section 1.1(f).

  



  

(g) The Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article 7.  If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Article 7, the Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
the Purchaser to, promptly (and in any event within twenty four (24) hours of
such termination) terminate the Offer and shall not acquire the Shares
pursuant thereto. If the Offer is terminated by the Purchaser, or this
Agreement is terminated prior to the acquisition of Shares in the Offer, the
Purchaser shall promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on
behalf of the Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all
tendered Shares that have not then been purchased in the Offer to
the registered holders thereof.

  



  

(h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
Parent and the Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule
14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits:
the Offer to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal, the notice of
guaranteed delivery, a form of summary advertisement and other ancillary
Offer documents and instruments required by the Exchange Act pursuant to
which the Offer shall be made (collectively, together with any amendments and
supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and the Purchaser
agree to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares,
as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and the Purchaser,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly
correct any information provided by such party for use in the Offer
Documents, if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable
Law, and Parent and the Purchaser agree to cause the Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in
each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company and
its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO
and the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and
the Purchaser shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In
addition, Parent and the Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel
with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral
comments, that Parent, the Purchaser or their counsel may

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments,
and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and
Parent and the Purchaser shall give due consideration to the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its
counsel.

  



  

Section 1.2 _Company Actions_.

  



  

(a) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC or as soon as
practicable thereafter, the Company shall, in a manner that complies with
Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5.4(d),
contain the Company Board Recommendation. The Schedule 14D-9 will comply in
all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act. The
Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to
promptly correct any information provided by such party for use in
the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required
by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as
so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares,
in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent, the
Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall
give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel. In addition,
the Company shall provide Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel with copies
of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the
Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such
comments, and any written or oral responses thereto.  Parent, the Purchaser
and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such
written responses and the Company shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, the
Purchaser and their counsel.

  



  

(b) Promptly after the date hereof (and in any event in sufficient time to
permit the Purchaser to commence the Offer in a timely manner) and otherwise
from time to time as requested by the Purchaser or its agents, the Company
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Purchaser mailing labels,
security position listings, non-objecting Beneficial Owner lists and any
other listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the
record or Beneficial Owners of the Shares as of the most recent practicable
date, and shall promptly furnish the Purchaser with such information
(including updated lists of holders of the Shares and their addresses,
mailing labels, security position listings and non-objecting Beneficial Owner
lists) and such other assistance as the Purchaser or its agents may
reasonably request in communicating with the record and Beneficial Owners of
Shares, in connection with the preparation and dissemination of the Schedule
TO and the Offer Documents and the solicitation of tenders of Shares in the
Offer.

  



         
 

  



  

Section 1.3 _Directors_.

  



  

(a) Promptly upon the purchase by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer of such
number of Shares as shall satisfy the Minimum Condition, and from time to
time thereafter, Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as shall
give Purchaser representation on the Company Board equal to the product of
the total number of directors on the Company Board (after giving effect to
any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this Section 1.3) and the
percentage that such number of Shares so purchased (including Shares accepted
for payment and the purchased Top-Up Shares) bears to the total number of
Shares outstanding, and the Company shall, upon request by Purchaser,
promptly increase the size of the Company Board or use its reasonable best
efforts to secure the resignations of such number of directors as is
necessary to provide Purchaser with such level of representation and shall
cause Purchasers designees to be so elected or appointed; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall be entitled to designate at least a majority of
the directors on the Company Board (as long as Parent and its Affiliates
Beneficially Own a majority of the Shares of the Company). Subject to
subsection (c) of this Section 1.3, the Company shall also cause individuals
designated by Purchaser to constitute the same percentage as such individuals
represent of the entire Company Board (but no less than a majority) on the
following: (i) each committee of the Company Board; (ii) each Board of
Directors and each committee thereof of each wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company and (iii) the designees, appointees or other similar representatives
of the Company on each Board of Directors (or other similar governing body)
and each committee thereof of each non-wholly owned Subsidiary. The
Companys obligations to appoint designees to the Company Board shall be
subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act. At the request of Purchaser,
the Company shall take all actions necessary to effect any such election or
appointment of Purchasers designees, including mailing to its stockholders
the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l
promulgated thereunder which, unless Purchaser otherwise elects, shall be so
mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent and Purchaser shall supply to
the Company all information with respect to themselves and their
respective officers, directors and Affiliates required by such Section and
Rule.

  



  

(b) Following the election or appointment of Purchasers designees pursuant
to Section 1.3(a) and prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause
the Company Board to maintain at least three directors who are members of the
Company Board on the date of this Agreement and who are not officers of the
Company and who are independent directors for purposes of the continued
listing requirements of the NYSE (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that if the number of Continuing Directors is reduced below
three for any reason, the remaining Continuing Directors shall be entitled to
elect or designate a person meeting the foregoing criteria to fill such
vacancy who shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this
Agreement or, if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other directors
shall designate three persons meeting the foregoing criteria to fill such
vacancies, and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for
purposes of this Agreement. The Company and the Company Board shall promptly
take all action as may be necessary to comply with their obligations under
this Section 1.3(b). So long as there shall be at least one Continuing
Director, any amendment or termination of this Agreement requiring action by
the Company Board, any extension of time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or Purchaser under this Agreement and any
waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or

  



        
   

  



  

conditions under this Agreement for the benefit of the Company or any
exercise of the Companys rights or remedies under this Agreement shall
require the concurrence of a majority of the Continuing Directors (or of the
sole Continuing Director if there shall then be only one Continuing
Director).

  



  

(c) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to Section 1.3(a), until the Effective Time, each
committee of the Company Board that is required by the NYSE rules or the
federal securities laws to be comprised solely of, or a majority of,
Continuing Directors shall be so comprised; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
such event, if the number of Continuing Directors shall be reduced below the
number of directors as may be required by such rules or securities laws for
any reason whatsoever, the remaining Continuing Director(s) shall be
entitled to designate persons meeting the foregoing criteria to fill such
vacancies who shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this
Agreement or, if no other Continuing Director then remains, the other
directors shall designate such number of directors as may be required by the
rules of the NYSE and the federal securities laws, to fill such vacancies who
shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of this Section
1.3(c).

  



  

Section 1.4 _The Merger_.

  



  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall
be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the Purchaser shall cease, and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "). The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and the
Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and the Purchaser shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, the Company Charter shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be amended and restated in its entirety to read as the certificate
of incorporation of the Purchaser in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that all references therein to the Purchaser shall be
deemed to be references to the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.  The bylaws of
the Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, except that all references therein
to the Purchaser shall be deemed to be references to the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

  



  

(c) The directors of the Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time

officers of the Company

  



        
   

  



  

immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time,
shall continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold

bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any
other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title
or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either

Section 1.5 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_.  The closing of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 8:00 a.m., Central Time, on a
date to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), such date to be

fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 333 West Wacker Drive, Chicago,

(the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger
shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or such other date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger, such date and time hereinafter

Section 1.6 _Meeting of Stockholders to Approve the Merger_.

  



  

(a) If elected by Parent, the Company shall prepare a proxy statement or
information statement for the Special Meeting (together with any amendments
and supplements thereto and any other required proxy materials, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") relating to the Merger and this Agreement.  If elected by
Parent, the Proxy Statement shall be so prepared prior to the Acceptance Time
such that the Proxy Statement shall be in a form ready, if necessary, to file
with the SEC as promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Time. If,
after the Acceptance Time, approval of the stockholders of the Company is
required under applicable Law

  



        
   

  



  

to consummate the Merger, the Company shall file the Proxy Statement with the
SEC as promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Time. Parent, the
Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
the Proxy Statement before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall
give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel. The
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the Purchaser, on the other hand,
agree to promptly correct any information provided by such party for use in
the Proxy Statement, if and to the extent that it shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable
Law, and the Company agrees to cause the Proxy Statement, as so corrected, to
be filed with the SEC and, if any such correction is made following the
mailing of the Proxy Statement, mailed to holders of Shares, in each case as
and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall provide
Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written comments,
and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Proxy Statement promptly after the Companys receipt of such comments, and
any written or oral responses thereto. Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses
and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and their
counsel.

  



  

(b) If, after the Acceptance Time, approval of the stockholders of the
Company is required under applicable Law to consummate the Merger, the
Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with and
subject to the requirements of applicable Law: (i) as promptly as
practicable after the Acceptance Time, in consultation with Parent, duly set
a record date for, and within five (5) Business Days after receipt of SEC
clearance of the Proxy Statement, call and give notice of a special meeting
of its stockholders (the " _Special Meeting_ ") for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon this Agreement (with the record date to be
set in consultation with Parent for a date after the Acceptance Time); (ii)
as promptly as practicable after the Acceptance Time, file the Proxy
Statement with the SEC, and, within five (5) Business Days after receipt of
SEC clearance of the Proxy Statement cause the Proxy Statement to be printed
and mailed to the stockholders of the Company; (iii) solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger, and secure any approval of the stockholders of the
Company that is required by applicable Law to effect the Merger; and (iv)
convene and hold the Special Meeting, _provided_ , that (A) the Company shall
not change the date of, postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting without
Parents prior written consent and (B) Parent may cause the Company to
postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting by prior written notice to the
Company.

  



  

(c) At the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, Parent
shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then owned of record by
Parent or the Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or the Purchaser
otherwise has, directly or indirectly, sole voting power in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to deliver or provide (or cause to be delivered
or provided), in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company, any other
approvals that are required by applicable Law to effect the Merger.

  



  

Section 1.7 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_.  Notwithstanding the
terms of Section 1.6, if after the Acceptance Time and, if applicable, the
expiration of any "subsequent

  



        
   

  



  

offering period" provided by the Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement
and, if applicable, the exercise of the Top-Up Option, Parent and the
Purchaser shall then hold of record, in the aggregate, at least 90% of the
outstanding shares (including the issuance of any Top-Up Shares) of each
class of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote on the adoption of
this Agreement under applicable Law (the " _Short Form Threshold_"), the
parties hereto agree to take all necessary and appropriate action to cause
the Merger to become effective as promptly as practicable, but no later than
the time set forth in Section 1.5, without a meeting of stockholders of the
Company in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 1.8 _Top-Up Option_.

  



  

(a) The Company hereby grants to the Purchaser an irrevocable option (the "
_Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable once upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, to purchase at the Offer Price an aggregate
number of Shares (the " _Top-Up Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of
Shares that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser
and their Affiliates at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one Share
more than the Short Form Threshold;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of Shares in excess
of the number of authorized but unissued Shares as of immediately prior to
the issuance of the Top-Up Shares (giving effect to Shares reserved for
issuance under the Company Equity Plans as if such Shares were outstanding);
provided further, that the Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the earlier of:
(x) the fifth (5th) Business Day after the later of (1) the Expiration Date
and (2) the expiration of any "subsequent offering period"; and (y) the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

  



  

(b) The obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Shares upon the exercise
of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (i) no provision of
any applicable Law (other than the rules and regulations of the NYSE,
which shall not apply for purposes of this Section 1.8) and no
judgment, injunction, Order or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-
Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares in respect of such exercise,
(ii) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of Shares owned by
Parent, Purchaser and their Affiliates constitutes one Share more than ninety
percent (90%) of the number of Shares that shall be outstanding immediately
after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares, and (iii) Purchaser has accepted for
payment all Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn.
The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Shares
is accomplished consistent with all applicable legal requirements of all
Governmental Entities, including compliance with an applicable exemption from
registration of the Top-Up Shares under the Securities Act.

  



  

(c) To exercise the Top-Up Option, the Purchaser shall send to the Company a
written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ") specifying (i) the number
of Shares that shall be owned by Parent, Purchaser and their
Affiliates immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Shares and (ii)
the place, time and date for the closing of the purchase and sale of the Top-
Up Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ ").  The Company shall, promptly after
receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to the
Purchaser confirming the number of Top-Up Shares and the aggregate purchase
price therefor (the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the Top-Up Closing, the
Purchaser shall pay the Company, in the manner set forth in Section 1.8(d)
hereof, the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares, in an
aggregate principal amount

  



        
   

  



  

equal to that specified in the Top-Up Notice Receipt, and the Company shall
cause to be issued and delivered to the Purchaser a certificate or
certificates representing the Top-Up Shares or, at the Purchasers request or
otherwise if the Company does not then have certificated Shares, the
applicable number of Book-Entry Shares. Such certificates or Book-Entry
Shares may include any legends that are required by applicable Law.

  



  

(d) Purchaser may pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for
the Top-Up Shares either (i) entirely in cash or (ii) at Purchasers
election, by (x) paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the
aggregate par value of the Top-Up Shares and (y) executing and delivering to
the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance
of the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount
paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause (x) (a " _Promissory Note_ ").
Any such Promissory Note shall be full recourse against Parent and the
Purchaser and (i) shall bear interest at the rate of 2% per annum, (ii) shall
mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
Promissory Note and (iii) may be prepaid, in whole or in part, without
premium or penalty.

  



  

(e) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Shares which Purchaser may
acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be registered under the
Securities Act and shall be issued in reliance upon an exemption for
transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Purchaser represent
and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is, or shall be upon any purchase
of Top-Up Shares, an " _accredited investor_ ", as defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D under the Securities Act. Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up
Option, and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option, if any, are being and shall be acquired by Purchaser for the purpose
of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

  



  

 ** _ARTICLE 2_** 


  

 **CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER**

  

 ** **

  

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Purchaser, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

  



  

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including each share of restricted
stock outstanding under the Company Equity Plans), other than Shares to be
cancelled or converted in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting
Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), payable net to the holder in cash,
without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable
Law in accordance with Section 2.2(e), upon surrender of the Certificate
formerly representing such Shares (or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
surrender of such Book-Entry Shares) in accordance with Section 2.2.

  



  

(b) _Cancellation or Conversion of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_.
All Shares that are held in the treasury of the Company and all Shares owned
of record by Parent, the Purchaser or any of their respective wholly owned
Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, with no payment
being made with respect thereto. At the Effective Time, all

  



        
   

  



  

Shares, if any, held by each Subsidiary of the Company shall remain
outstanding and shall become that number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation that bears the same ratio to the aggregate number of
outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation as the number
of Shares held by such Subsidiary bore to the aggregate number of outstanding
Shares of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(c) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ ") shall be converted into and
become one newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

  



  

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
designate a reputable national bank reasonably acceptable to the Company to
act as the paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent or the Purchaser shall deposit, or cause
to be deposited, with the Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall be entitled at the
Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement. Such funds shall be invested or
otherwise held by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, pending payment
thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares; _provided_
_however_ , in the event that such funds on deposit with the Paying Agent are
insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, Parent shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent such additional funds to
ensure that the Paying Agent has funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration. Earnings from such investments, if any, shall be the sole and
exclusive property of Parent, and no part of any such earnings shall accrue
to the benefit of holders of Shares.

  



  

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ "), in each case, which Shares were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to
this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and
shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or
the Paying Agent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for
payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificates and for each Book-Entry
Share.  Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (x) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise
in proper form for

  



        
   

  



  

transfer, and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest
thereon.

  



  

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. As of the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable Law.  If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_.  At any time
following the one year anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made
available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Shares, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Shares and compliance with the procedures
in Section 2.2(b), without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law in accordance with Section 2.2(e).  If, prior to
six years after the Effective Time (or otherwise immediately prior to such
time on which any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws), any holder of Shares has not complied
with the procedures in Section 2.2(b) to receive payment of the Merger
Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the payment
in respect of such Shares shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any holder of Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  



  

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the relevant Offer Price or Merger Consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts that
Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any
provision of applicable Law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld by
Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having

  



        
   

  



  

been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent.

  



  

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1(a) hereof; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as
a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require
the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond
in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

  



  

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded
appraisal for such Shares in accordance with, and who complies in
all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and shall instead represent the right to receive
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with and to
the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.  If any such holder fails to
perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under
Section 262 of the DGCL or other applicable Law, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the
Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with Section
2.2(e). The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares,
and Parent shall have the right to participate in and to control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer
to settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock Units_.

  



  

(a) _Assumption of Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, (i) each
then outstanding and unexercised option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock (such options, the " _Company Stock Options_ ") awarded under any
equity incentive plan of the Company, including the Companys 2002 Incentive
Compensation Plan, as amended, the Companys 2005 Incentive Compensation
Plan, the Companys Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, the VISX,
Incorporated 2001 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan, the VISX, Incorporated 2000
Stock Plan, the VISX, Incorporated 1995 Director Option and Stock Deferral
Plan, as amended and restated, the VISX, Incorporated 1995 Stock Plan, as
amended, or any other similar plan, agreement, or arrangement, but excluding
the Companys Amended and Restated 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the
Companys Amended and Restated 2002

  



        
   

  



  

International Stock Purchase Plan (and any similar foreign employee stock
purchase plans) (collectively, the " _Company Equity Plans_ "), whether
or not vested or exercisable prior to or as a result of the consummation of
the Merger, and (ii) each Company Equity Plan, shall, without any
further action on the part of any holder of a Company Stock Option, be
assumed by Parent. Each Company Stock Option assumed by Parent under this
Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, substantially the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under the Company Equity Plans and
the documents governing the Company Stock Options immediately before the
Effective Time, except that (x) each Company Stock Option will be exercisable
for that number of common shares, without par value, of Parent (the " _Parent
Common Stock_ ") (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the
product of (1) the number of Shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option and (2) the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the
Merger Consideration by (B) the Fair Market Value of a share of Parent Common
Stock as of the Effective Time (such quotient, the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), and
(y) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Company Stock Options will be equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (1) the per share exercise price for the shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option by (2) the
Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) (each such Company
Stock Option, as so adjusted, a " _Converted Parent Option_ "). For purposes
of this Section 2.4(a), " _Fair Market Value of a share of Parent Common
Stock_ " shall mean the per share closing sale price of Parent Company Common
Stock on the NYSE (as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape)
on the trading day immediately prior to the date on which the Effective Time
occurs.

  



  

(b) _Terms and Conditions of Converted Parent Options_.  The Converted
Parent Options shall have the same vesting schedule (including any
acceleration of vesting as provided in the Company Equity Plans) as the
Company Stock Options; _provided_ that Parent shall convert Company Stock
Options into Converted Parent Options in such a manner as to ensure that (i)
the Converted Parent Options are not subject to Section 409A of the Code as
a result of the assumption and conversion and (ii) Converted Parent
Options received with respect to Company Stock Options that were "incentive
stock options," or "ISOs," within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code
shall continue to be ISOs within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall cooperate in taking
all actions that are necessary to cause the Company Stock Options to be
assumed and converted as provided in this Section 2.4.

  



  

(c) _Treatment of Company Restricted Stock Units_.  As of the Acceptance
Time, each unvested restricted stock unit awarded under the Company Equity
Plans (" _Restricted Stock Units_ ") shall vest in full and shall be settled
for Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Company Equity Plan, which shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted
in accordance with Section 2.1(a) into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) _Equity Award Waivers_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall
use its best efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents or releases,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, from holders of
Company Stock Options under the Company Equity Plans and take all such other
action, without incurring any liabilities in connection therewith, as Parent
may deem to be necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Section 2.4 (the " _Equity Award Waivers_ "). As promptly
as practicable following the date of

  



        
   

  



  

this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
thereof administering the Company Equity Plans) shall adopt such resolutions
or take such other actions as are required to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.4.

  



  

(e) _Reservation of Shares_. Parent will (i) reserve for issuance the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock that will become subject to the Converted
Parent Options referred to in this Section 2.4 and (ii) issue or cause to be
issued the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock, upon the
exercise of the Converted Parent Options. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent will prepare and file with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) registering a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to fulfill Parents obligations under
this Section 2.4. Such registration statement will be kept effective (and the
current status of the prospectus required thereby will be maintained) for at
least as long as Converted Parent Options remain outstanding.

  



  

(f) _Notices_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will
deliver to the holders of the Converted Parent Options appropriate notices
setting forth the effect of the Merger on such holders rights pursuant to
the Company Equity Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of such
Company Stock Options, and that such Company Stock Options will continue in
effect as the Converted Parent Options on the same terms and conditions
(subject to the adjustment required by this Section 2.4 after giving effect
to the Merger).

  



  

Section 2.5 _Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plans_.  The current
offerings in progress as of the date hereof under the Companys Amended and
Restated 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the Companys Amended and
Restated 2002 International Stock Purchase Plan (and any similar foreign
employee stock purchase plans) (collectively, the " _ESPPs_ ") shall
continue, and the shares of Company Common Stock shall be issued
to participants of such ESPPs on the next currently scheduled purchase
dates thereunder occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time as provided under, and subject to the terms and conditions of, each
ESPP. In accordance with the terms of the relevant ESPP, any offering in
progress as of the Effective Time shall be shortened, and each then-
outstanding option under the ESPPs shall be exercised automatically on the
Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any
restrictions on transfer of stock in the relevant ESPP, the treatment in the

owners of each Subsidiarys outstanding capital stock or ownership interests

Ordinary Course of the Companys Business), (vii)(A)(1), (xi) or (xiii) of
Section 5.1(a) or the authorization of or making any commitment to do such
action or event; and (i) any business practice to materially accelerate the
timing or materially increase the amount of sales or shipments of products
outside of the Ordinary Course of the Companys Business and in such a manner
so as to cause the products so sold or shipped to be unable to be resold to
the end-user customer or otherwise recognized as revenue of the Company under
GAAP.

  



  

Section 3.12 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_.

  



  

(a) Except as reflected in the Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) which are required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated

notes thereto, other than (i) any liabilities and obligations incurred since

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, partnership agreement or
any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any transaction,
arrangement or relationship between or among the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand) where the purpose or intended effect of such arrangement
is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in the Companys consolidated financial statements.

acceleration under any of the Material Contracts.

  



  

Section 3.14 _Employee Benefit Plans, Options and Employment Agreements_.

  



  

(a) Section 3.14(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and accurate list of (i) each " _employee benefit plan_ " as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA (whether foreign or domestic or whether or not subject
to ERISA), (ii) all other material severance pay, salary continuation, bonus,
incentive, retirement, thrift, savings, pension, workers compensation,

related thereto, whether or not funded, in respect of any present or former
employees, directors, or officers of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or
any of the Controlled Group Members, which are sponsored or maintained by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of the Controlled Group Members or
with respect to which the Company,

  



        
   

  



  

any of its Subsidiaries, or any of the Controlled Group Members is obligated
to make payments, transfers, or contributions, or under which any of them has
or would be reasonably likely to have any material liability for premiums or
benefits for the benefit of any present or former employees or directors of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of the Controlled Group Members
whether employed within the United States or outside of the United States
(collectively, the " _Employee Benefit Plans_ "). Neither the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries nor any of the Controlled Group Members has any material
liability with respect to any plan, Contract, program, fund or arrangement of
the type described in the preceding sentence other than as set forth in the
Employee Benefit Plans. " _Controlled Group Member_ " means each member of
any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) (x) under common control
(within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ")) with the Company, or (y)
which together with the Company is treated as a single employer under Section
414(t) of the Code.

  



  

(b) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, the Company has made
available to Parent true, complete and correct copies of (i) such Employee
Benefit Plan (or a written summary of any unwritten plan) together with all
amendments, (ii) in the case of any Employee Benefit Plan for which Forms
5500 are required to be filed, the three (3) most recent annual reports (Form
5500) with schedules attached, (iii) in the case of any Employee Benefit Plan
that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, the most
recent determination letter from the IRS, (iv) each trust agreement,
insurance or group annuity contract, administration and similar agreements,
and investment management or investment advisory agreements, (v) the most
recent summary plan descriptions and employee handbook, or other similar
employee communications relating to employee benefits matters, (vi) all
personnel, payroll and employment manuals and policies, and (vii) the most
recent financial statements for each Employee Benefit Plan that is funded.

  



  

(c) Each Employee Benefit Plan is in material compliance with and has been
administered in all material respects in accordance with all applicable Laws
and the regulations thereunder, including, as applicable, ERISA and the Code,
its terms, the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreements, and
each of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries and any of the Controlled Group
Members has in all material respects met its obligations with respect to each
Employee Benefit Plan and has timely made (or timely shall make) all
required contributions thereto and is not in default or violation of and the
Company has no Knowledge of any material default or violation by any other
party to any Employee Benefit Plan. No Employee Benefit Plan is or within
the last three calendar years has been the subject of, or has received notice
that it is the subject of, an examination by a Governmental Entity or a
participant in a government sponsored amnesty, voluntary compliance or
similar program that has given rise to or is reasonably expected to give rise
to any material liability. All filings, reports, returns, and
similar documents, as to each Employee Benefit Plan required to have been
submitted to the IRS or to the United States Department of Labor, or to any
other Governmental Entity have been timely submitted.  With respect to the
Employee Benefit Plans, no event has occurred, and, to the Companys
Knowledge, no condition or set of circumstances exists in connection with
which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any of the Controlled Group
Members, or any Employee Benefit Plan participant would be reasonably likely
to be subject to any material liability (including penalties or taxes) under
any applicable Law, including ERISA or the Code, nor, to the Companys
Knowledge, would the negotiation or consummation of the transactions

  



        
   

  



  

contemplated by this Agreement be reasonably likely to give rise to any such
liability. There have been no (i) non-exempt prohibited transactions (as
defined in Section 4975(c) of the Code and Section 406 of ERISA) with respect
to any such Employee Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code
or Section 406 of ERISA, where any party dealing with such Employee Benefit
Plan or any such trust could reasonably be expected to be subject to either a
civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax
imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code, (ii) breaches of any of
the duties imposed on " _fiduciaries_ " (within the meaning of Section
3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with respect to the Employee Benefit Plans that are
subject to ERISA that could reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability or excise tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed on the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Controlled Group Members or (iii)
material breaches of any other fiduciary duty under applicable Law.

  



  

(d) With respect to the Employee Benefit Plans, there are no material
benefit obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly
accrued and there are no benefit obligations which have not been accounted
for by reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with the
requirements of GAAP, on the financial statements of the Company.  The
assets of each Employee Benefit Plan which is funded are reported at their
fair market value on the books and records of such Employee Benefit Plan.

  



  

(e) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code (each, a " _Qualified Plan_ ") has received determination,
opinion or advisory letters from the IRS to the effect that such Employee
Benefit Plan is qualified and the plan and trust related thereto are exempt
from federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of
the Code, or the Company has remaining a period of time under applicable U.S.
Department of the Treasury regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to
apply for such a letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination as to the qualified status of each such Qualified
Plan. No such determination, opinion or advisory letter has been revoked and,
no such revocation has been threatened. No such Employee Benefit Plan has
been amended or operated since the date of its most recent determination
letter or application therefor in any respect, and no act or omission has
occurred, that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect its
qualification or increase its cost. The Company has provided Parent with a
complete and accurate copy of the most recent determination letter received
prior to the date hereof for each Qualified Plan, as well as a complete and
accurate copy of each pending application for a determination letter, if any.
The Company has also provided to Parent a complete and accurate list of all
amendments to each Qualified Plan as to which a favorable determination
letter has not yet been received or application for a determination letter
made. There has been no termination, partial termination or discontinuance of
contributions to any Qualified Plan that shall result in material liability
to the Company. Each Employee Benefit Plan which is required to satisfy
Section 401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of the Code has been tested for
compliance with, and satisfies in all material respects, the requirements of
Section 401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of the Code, as the case may be, for
each plan year ending prior to the Closing Date for which testing is required
to be completed.

  



  

(f) Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any of the Controlled Group
Members has ever (i) maintained a Employee Benefit Plan that was subject to
Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA or had any liability with
respect to such plan or (ii) been obligated to

  



        
   

  



  

contribute to a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3)
of ERISA) that is subject to ERISA. No Employee Benefit Plan is funded by,
associated with or related to a "voluntary employees beneficiary
association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

  



  

(g) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Employee Benefit Plan
(other than the Company Equity Plans, the ESPPs, or an employment, severance,
change in control or similar agreement with an individual) is amendable and
terminable unilaterally by the Company or one or more of its Subsidiaries or
one of the Controlled Group Members party thereto or covered thereby at any
time without material liability to the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries or
any Controlled Group Member as a result thereof, other than for benefits
accrued as of the date of such amendment or termination and routine
administrative costs.

  



  

(h) Other than as required under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA, none of the
Employee Benefit Plans promises or provides health or other welfare benefits
(excluding normal claims for benefits under the Companys group life
insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and disability plans
and policies) or coverage to any person following retirement or other
termination of employment.

  



  

(i) There are no actions, suits, proceedings, claims, arbitrations, audits
or investigations that are pending or, to the Companys Knowledge,
threatened, with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan (i) other than claims
for benefits to be determined by the Company in the Ordinary Course of the
Companys Business, or (ii) by or on behalf of any current or former employee
of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Controlled Group
Members, and to the Companys Knowledge, no fact or event exists that could
give rise to any such matter. No action, suit, proceeding, claim,
arbitration, audit or investigation is pending or, to the Companys
Knowledge, threatened, with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, other than
claims for benefits in the Ordinary Course of the Companys Business.

  



  

(j) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a material liability, each individual who has received
compensation for the performance of services on behalf of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any Controlled Group Member has been properly classified
as an employee or independent contractor in accordance with applicable Law.
Except as set forth in Section 3.14(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no
current or former independent contractor that provides or provided personal
services to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Controlled Group
Member (other than a current or former member of the Companys Board of
Directors) is entitled to any material fringe or other benefits (other than
cash consulting fees) pursuant to any plan, Contract, program, fund or
arrangement of any kind which the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Controlled Group Member is a party or which is maintained, sponsored, or
contributed to by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Controlled
Group Member.

  



  

(k) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, (i) all liabilities with
respect to such plan are set forth on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company, its Subsidiaries and the Controlled Group Members or in the notes
thereto in accordance with GAAP; (ii) each such plan required to be
registered with a Governmental Entity has been registered; and (iii) in the
case of any such plan that is a defined benefit pension plan (or termination
indemnity plan), the fair market value of the assets of each such plan,
together with any accrued contributions and

  



        
   

  



  

applicable book reserve, is sufficient to procure or provide for the
liability for accrued benefits with respect to those current and former
employees of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Controlled Group Member
that participate in such plan according to the generally accepted country and
plan-specific actuarial or other applicable assumptions and valuations most
recently used to determine employer contributions to or the funded status of
such plans.

  



  

(l) Section 3.14(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and accurate list of (i) all employment agreements with executive employees
and any other material employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(ii) all non-competition agreements with current or former executive
employees of the Company or officers of any of its Subsidiaries; (iii) all
severance programs and policies that provide severance in excess of the
amount required by Law to the employees of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Controlled Group Member, but, excluding such programs and
policies providing only severance to the extent required by Law; and (iv) all
plans, Contracts, programs, funds and arrangements of any kind of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Controlled Group Member pursuant to
which payments (or acceleration of benefits or vesting of options or lapse of
repurchase rights) may be required upon, or may become payable directly or
indirectly as a result of or in connection with, the negotiation or
consummation of the transactions contemplated by, or the execution of, this
Agreement.

  



  

(m) All material (i) insurance premiums required to be paid with respect to,
(ii) benefits, expenses, and other amounts due and payable under, and (iii)
contributions, transfers, or payments required to be made to, any Employee
Benefit Plan on or prior to the Effective Time have been or shall be timely
made or are reflected on the Companys Balance Sheet. There are no pending
or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened or reasonably anticipated claims
by or on behalf of any plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any
such Employee Benefit Plan, or otherwise involving any such plan (other than
routine claims for benefits).

  



  

(n) With respect to any Contract or insurance policy providing funding for
benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan, (i) to the Companys Knowledge,
there is no material liability of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Controlled Group Member in the nature of a retroactive rate adjustment, loss
sharing arrangement, or other actual or contingent liability, nor, to the
Companys Knowledge, would there be any such liability if such Contract or
insurance policy was terminated on the date hereof, and (ii) neither any
party to any such Contract nor any insurance company issuing any such policy
is in receivership, conservatorship, liquidation or similar proceeding and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, no such proceedings with respect to any such
insurer are imminent.

  



  

(o) None of the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries or any Controlled Group
Member has agreed or committed to institute any plan, Contract, program, fund
or arrangement of any kind for the benefit of employees or former employees
of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Controlled Group Member other
than the Employee Benefit Plans, or to make any amendments to any of the
Employee Benefit Plans. No Employee Benefit Plan provides benefits to any
individual who is not a current or former employee of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Controlled Group Member, or the dependents or other
beneficiaries of any such current or former employee.

  



        
   

  



  

(p) Section 3.14(p) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true,
complete and correct list of each plan, program or arrangement that is or may
reasonably be deemed to be subject to Section 409A of the Code.  Each
Employee Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as
defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated since January 1,
2005 in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS Notice
2005-1 is now in documentary compliance. No Employee Benefit Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" has been materially modified (as
determined under Notice 2005-1) after October 3, 2004.  Except as set forth
in Section 3.14(p) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no award granted under
any of the Company Equity Plans or any ESPP is subject to Section 409A of the
Code.

  



  

(q) There are no outstanding Company Incentive Awards or any restricted
stock, restricted stock units, performance awards or other benefits granted
under any equity incentive plan of any Subsidiary of the Company that are
payable in cash.

  



  

(r) The negotiation or consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event
(including as a result of termination of employment on or following the
Closing), (i) entitle any current or former employee or officer of the
Company, or any of its Subsidiaries or any Controlled Group Member to
severance pay, or any other payment from the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any Controlled Group Member, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, cause a lapse of repurchase rights, trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise) of, or compensation or benefits under,
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant
to any Employee Benefit Plan or increase the amount of compensation due any
such employee or officer, or (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or
default under any Employee Benefit Plan. There is no Employee Benefit Plan or
other plan, Contract, program, fund or arrangement of any kind, that,
individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount
that would not be deductible pursuant to Sections 280G (determined without
regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code) or 162(m) of the Code.

  



  

(s) All amounts payable to holders of Company Common Stock and other
securities of the Company pursuant to the Employee Benefit Plans (i) are
being paid or granted as compensation for past services performed, future
services to be performed or future services to be refrained from performing
by such holders (and matters incidental thereto) and (ii) are not calculated
based on the number of shares tendered or to be tendered into the Offer by
the applicable holder. The compensation committee of the Company Board (the "
_Compensation Committee_ ") (each member of which the Company Board
determined is an "independent director" within the meaning of Section 303A.02
of the NYSE Listed Company Manual and is an "independent director" in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act)
(A) at a meeting duly called and held, or in action by unanimous written
consent, duly adopted resolutions approving as an "employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule
14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act (1) each Company Equity Plan, (2) each
ESPP, (3) the treatment of the Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock
Units in accordance with the terms set forth in this Agreement, the
applicable Company Equity Plan and any applicable Employee Benefit Plans, and
(4) each other Employee Benefit Plan, which resolutions have not been
rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way, and (B) has taken all other
actions necessary to satisfy the requirements of the non-

  



        
   

  



  

exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with
respect to the foregoing arrangements.

  



  

(t) All Foreign Employee Benefit Plans (i) have been maintained and funded in
all material respects in accordance with all applicable requirements
(including all applicable Tax withholding and reporting requirements and all
applicable legal filings), (ii) if they are intended to qualify for special
tax treatment, meet all material requirements for such treatment, and (iii)
if they are intended to be funded and/or book-reserved, are fully funded
and/or book reserved in all respects, as appropriate, based upon reasonable
actuarial assumptions.

  



  

(u) Except as required under Section 2.4, there is no obligation to
consult, negotiate, or reach agreement with any employee, employee group, or
employee representative with respect to the negotiation or consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(v) Each Employee Benefit Plan has timely filed with the SEC all forms,
reports, schedules, statements and other documents, including any exhibits
and schedules thereto, required to be filed by such Employee Benefit Plan
with the SEC (collectively, the " _Benefit Plan SEC Reports_ ") since its
respective inception. The Benefit Plan SEC Reports, including all forms,
reports and documents filed by the Employee Benefit Plans with the SEC after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, (i) were prepared in all
material respects in accordance with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations thereunder, and (ii) did not at the time they were filed contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated in such Benefit Plan SEC Reports or necessary in order
to make the statements in such Benefit Plan SEC Reports, in light of the
circumstances under which they were or shall be made, not misleading.

  



  

(w) Each Company Equity Plan and each Company Stock Option (i) has been duly
and validly authorized in a timely manner by all necessary action on the part
of the Company; and (ii) has timely received all authorization and
approval by the shareholders of the Company required under Law, under the
applicable listing standards or corporate governance rules and provisions of
the NYSE (or any other applicable securities exchange), or otherwise.

not since been filed, other than automatic extensions allowed by Law. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any outstanding waiver of

to all taxable years for which the statutes of limitation have not expired;
_provided_  that, with respect solely to state income Tax Returns, this

this Agreement, no Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the Company
or, during the time that a Subsidiary has continued as a Subsidiary of the
Company, a Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns has ever claimed in writing

liability for any Taxes by that jurisdiction or is required to file a Tax
Return in that jurisdiction.

  



  

(g) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary will be required to include any

(b) To the Companys Knowledge, the Company or one or more of its

Company or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, (iv) materially
restrict the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries rights to use any

conducted in order to avoid infringement of any third partys trademarks.

  



  

(e) To the Companys Knowledge, the conduct of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted does not infringe upon, violate
or constitute the unauthorized use of any Intellectual Property rights owned
by any third party. The Company and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable
measures, including implementing and enforcing a policy regarding employees
and contractors, to establish ownership of Intellectual Property and protect
the proprietary nature of the trade secrets owned by the Company and such
Subsidiary that are used in or material to the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.  The Company and its
Subsidiaries have taken reasonable measures to protect the trade secrets of
third parties provided thereto as used in Companys business. To the
Companys Knowledge, no third party is misappropriating, infringing, diluting
or violating any Intellectual Property rights owned by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that are material to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as currently conducted, and no Intellectual Property
misappropriation, infringement, dilution or violation, suits, arbitrations,
mediations (whether or not binding) or other adversarial proceedings have
been brought before any court, government agency or arbitral or mediation
tribunal against any third party by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
which remain unresolved.

a conditional release of) any of its proprietary source code contained in any

Product_ ")(other than to contractors engaged by the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries who are subject to written confidentiality obligations to the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries and the policy referenced in Section

and interest in and to such Company-proprietary source code contained in or
required for such Proprietary Products.

  



  

(g) To the Companys Knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in breach or default of any license, sublicense, agreement,
security interest or instrument to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is party or otherwise bound that either impairs or otherwise
encumbers any Intellectual Property rights owned by the Company or its
Subsidiaries or under which the Company or its Subsidiaries derive rights to
Intellectual Property that is used in and material to the Companys or
its Subsidiaries business as currently

  



        
   

  



  

conducted, and all such licenses, sublicenses, agreements and instruments are
subsisting and in full force and effect.

  



  

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Intellectual Property_ " shall
include: (i) trademarks, service marks, trade names, and Internet domain
names, together with all goodwill, registrations and applications related to
the foregoing; (ii) patents and industrial design registrations or
applications (including any continuations, divisionals, continuations-in-
part, renewals, reissues, re-examinations and applications for any of the

copies of all material licenses, sublicenses and other agreements (i)
granting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries rights in or to any
Intellectual Property owned by a third party, (ii) authorizing any Person to
use or practice any rights under, or grant sublicenses with respect to, any
Company Registered Intellectual Property, (iii) relating to Intellectual
Property and containing covenants limiting the freedom of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to (A) sell any products or services of or to any other
Person, (B) engage in any line of business, or (C) compete with any Person or

(collectively, the " _Material IP Contracts_ "). The Company has heretofore
provided to Parent true and complete copies of the IP Standard Form
Contracts, and the Company has not executed any IP Standard Form Contract
with any Person that includes material deviations, with respect to
Intellectual Property rights, from the IP Standard Form Contract terms.

therein).

  



  

(d) At the consummation of the Offer and the Merger, Parent and the Purchaser
shall have cash and cash equivalents, and available lines of credit,
sufficient to consummate the Offer and the Merger and to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement.

Section 5.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall,
and shall cause each Subsidiary of the Company and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors (including attorneys,
accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors) (collectively, "
_Company Representatives_ ") (i) to provide to Parent and the Purchaser and
their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors
(including attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial
advisors) (collectively, the " _Parent Representatives_ ") full access at
reasonable times upon prior notice to the officers, employees, agents,
properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and the Subsidiaries
and to their

  



        
   

  



  

books and records, (ii) upon notice by Parent to, and in coordination with,
any of the individuals set forth on Section 5.3 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, to provide Parent and the Purchaser the reasonable
opportunity to communicate with the Company Employees they expect to retain

information related to the ownership of capital stock of the Company,
including access to the Companys transfer agent, as Parent may request.
 Such access shall include the right to conduct Phase I
environmental reviews at any property, office or other facility of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that such access shall not
include any right to test or take samples of air, water, groundwater, soil or
any other media at any property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such
investigation or consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would contravene any Law. No investigation conducted pursuant to this Section
5.3(a) shall affect or be deemed to qualify, modify or limit any
representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to Section 5.3(a),
Parent shall comply with, and shall cause the Parent Representatives to
comply with, all of its obligations under the Nondisclosure Agreement, the

Section 3.14(a) and in Section 3.14(b) with respect to Foreign Employee
Benefit Plans.  Prior to the delivery of such information, the
representations and warranties in the first sentence of Section 3.14(a) and
in Section 3.14(b) shall apply to Foreign Employee Benefit Plans only to the
extent of the Knowledge of the Company. From and after the delivery of such
information, the representations and warranties in the first sentence of
Section 3.14(a) and in Section 3.14(b) shall be deemed to be made with
respect to Foreign Employee Benefit Plans without regard to the preceding
sentence. In addition, until the delivery of the information described in the
preceding sentences, the representations and warranties set forth in the
portions of Section 3.14 other than the first sentence of Section 3.14(a) and
Section 3.14(b), as they relate to Foreign Employee Benefit Plans, shall be
limited to the Knowledge of the Company. From and after the delivery of such
information, the preceding sentence shall no longer apply. A " _Foreign
Employee Benefit Plan_ " is any Employee Benefit Plan that provides benefits
only for employees or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who
are employed outside of the United States.

  



  

(d) Within 10 Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the Company
will provide to Parent the information described in clauses (IV), (V) and

Company and Parent, which information shall be set forth in a restated
Section 3.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Prior to the delivery of
such information, the representations and warranties in clauses (IV), (V) and
(IX) of

  



        
   

  



  

Section 3.3(b) shall not apply to Company Stock Options and Company Incentive
Awards. From and after the delivery of such information, the representations

deemed to be made with respect to Company Stock Options and Company Incentive
Awards.

  



  

(e) Within 15 Business Days after the date of this Agreement, the Company
will provide to Parent the information described in Section 3.15(h). Prior to
the delivery of such information, the representations and warranties in
Section 3.15(h) shall not apply. From and after the delivery of such
information, the representations and warranties in Section 3.15(h) shall be
deemed to be made.

  



  

Section 5.4 _No Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) From and after the date hereof until the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives
not to, directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly take any
action to facilitate or encourage (including by way of providing information)
the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers or any other efforts or
attempts that constitute, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any discussions or negotiations with
respect thereto, (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) withdraw (or change, amend, modify
or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or the Purchaser), or propose
publicly to withdraw (or change, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or the Purchaser), or otherwise make any statement or
proposal inconsistent with, the Company Board Recommendation (any action or
failure to act set forth in the foregoing clauses (ii) or (iii), a " _Change
of Board Recommendation_ "), or (iv) enter into any merger agreement, letter
of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase
agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar
Contract relating to an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any Contract or
agreement in principle that is intended or would reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or that would reasonably be expected to
cause the Company to abandon, terminate or breach its obligations hereunder
or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement,
discussion or negotiation with any Persons conducted prior to the execution
of this Agreement by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of the Company
Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and cause to be
returned or destroyed all confidential information provided by or on behalf
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such Person to the extent that
the Company is entitled to have such documents returned or destroyed.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(a), if
at any time following the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time (i)
the Company has received an Acquisition Proposal from a third party that did
not arise out of a breach of this Section 5.4, (ii) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with financial advisors and
outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably
likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (iii) after consultation with its
outside counsel, the Company Board determines in good faith that the failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, then the Company may (A)
enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and a data privacy
agreement that

  



        
   

  



  

contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the data privacy agreement executed by Parent
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (B)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal and (C) participate in discussions
or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding
such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that the Company (x) shall
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent
orally and in writing of any determination concerning an Acquisition Proposal
pursuant to this Section 5.4(b), (y) shall not, and shall not allow
its Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives to, disclose any information
to such Person without first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and a data privacy agreement that contains provisions that are no
less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
data privacy agreement executed by Parent in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (z) shall promptly provide
to Parent any information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided
to such other Person which was not previously provided to Parent.

  



  

(c) The Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any Acquisition
Proposal (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours following the
Companys, its Subsidiarys or any Company Representatives receipt of the
Acquisition Proposal), such notice to include the identity of the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal and a copy of such Acquisition Proposal and
any related documentation or correspondence or, where no such copy is
available, a reasonably detailed description of such Acquisition Proposal.
The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis (and in
no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after the occurrence of any
material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of
any Acquisition Proposal, any discussions and negotiations with respect
thereto, and the material terms and conditions thereof, including by
providing a copy of all material documentation or correspondence relating
thereto that is exchanged between the Person making an Acquisition Proposal
(or its Representatives) and the Company (or its Representatives).  The
Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive,
amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, any standstill
or confidentiality Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(a), if
the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and
financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after giving effect to
all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by
Parent (including pursuant to clause (II) below), the Company Board may at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) effect a Change of Board
Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal and/or (ii)
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii),
unless substantially concurrently with such termination the Company pays the
Breakup Fee and otherwise complies with the provisions of Section 7.1(e) and
Section 7.3; and provided further that the Company Board may not effect a
change of Company Board Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant
to the foregoing clause (ii) unless (A) the Company shall not have breached
this Section 5.4, (B) the Company Board shall have taken into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a
Notice of Adverse Recommendation, and (C):

  



         
 

  



  

(I) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent (" _Notice
of Adverse Recommendation_ "), at least five (5) Business Days in
advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to take such action with
respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and shall have
contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction
agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal and other material
documents (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a
new Notice of Adverse Recommendation and a new notice period, which shall be
three (3) Business Days in advance of the Company Boards intention to take
action pursuant to this Section 5.4(d)); and

  



  

(II) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or terminating
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good
faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.

  



  

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall prohibit the Company Board
from disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any disclosure of a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act other than a "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition
Proposal or an express reaffirmation of its recommendation to its
stockholders in favor of the Offer shall be deemed to be a Change of Board
Recommendation.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing, (i) each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall use its
reasonable best efforts to make promptly any required submissions under the
HSR Act or the EC Merger Regulation and any submissions under any applicable
foreign Competition Laws that are required to be made or which the Company
and Parent mutually agree should be made, in each case, with respect to the
Offer, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii)
Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate with one another (A) in
promptly determining whether any filings are required to be or should be made
or consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be or
should be obtained under any Law or whether any consents, approvals or
waivers are required to be or should be obtained from other parties to
Contracts or instruments material to the Companys business in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(B) in promptly making any such filings, furnishing information required in
connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any consents, permits,
authorizations,

  



        
   

  



  

approvals or waivers required to be made or which the Company and Parent
mutually agree should be made.

  



  

(b) In the event that any action, suit, proceeding or investigation relating
hereto or to the transactions contemplated hereby is commenced, whether
before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and
use their reasonable best efforts to defend vigorously against it and respond
thereto and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.6 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other
party hereto of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that
would be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to
effect the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement not to be satisfied or (b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement required to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to
this Agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in any condition
to the obligations of any party to effect the Offer, the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 5.6 shall not cure any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

  



  

Section 5.7 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and the
Purchaser agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the
prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or
announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of
any applicable Governmental Entity to which the relevant party is subject, in
which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use
its reasonable best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being
understood that the final form and content of any such release or
announcement, to the extent required, shall be at the final discretion of the
disclosing party. The Company, Parent and the Purchaser agree that the press
release announcing the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a
joint release of, and shall not be issued prior to the approval of each of,
the Company and Parent.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

  



  

(a) Until December 31, 2009, the Surviving Corporation shall provide
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who are located in the United
States with employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those benefits that were provided to such employees under the
Companys Employee Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding, for this purpose, any equity compensation arrangements that were
made available to such employees prior to the Effective Time); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation (or any of
their respective Affiliates) shall be under any

  



        
   

  



  

obligation to retain any employee or group of employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries other than as required by applicable Law.

  



  

(b) With respect to any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, excluding both
any retiree healthcare plans or programs maintained by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries and any equity compensation arrangement maintained by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") in
which any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the " _Company Employees_ ") will participate effective as of
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, recognize all service of the Company Employees with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, for vesting and eligibility purposes
(but not for (i) purposes of early retirement subsidies under any Parent
Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan or (ii) benefit accrual
purposes, except for vacation, if applicable) in any Parent Benefit Plan in
which such Company Employees may be eligible to participate after the
Effective Time; _provided_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits or to
the extent that such service was not recognized under the corresponding
Employee Benefit Plan.

  



  

(c) Except as to any communications previously approved, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not distribute or otherwise convey to any of their
respective employees without the prior written approval of Parent, any
communications intended to be made to any of their respective employees
relating to (i) the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) with respect to
any employee benefit plans or programs of Parent or Purchaser; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, with respect to communications described in clause (i) of
this sentence, if such approval is not received within forty-eight (48) hours
after the Company delivers such communication to the appropriate officer of
Parent, such approval shall be deemed to have been received by the Company.

  



  

(d) Within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof, the Company
shall deliver or make available to Parent pursuant to the data privacy
agreement executed between the Company and Parent a true, complete and
correct list that sets forth, as of the date hereof, the name and current
salary/wage rates of each full-time and part-time employee of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries and the Controlled Group Members (the " _Current
Company Employees_ "), that also indicates whether any Current Company
Employees are currently on leave of absence for any reason.

  



  

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such actions as
Parent may reasonably request so as to enable the Surviving Corporation to
effect such actions relating to the Company 401(k) Plan (the " _401(k)
Plan_") as Parent may deem necessary or appropriate, including terminating
the 401(k) Plan prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms of the
401(k) Plan and applicable Law and provided that such action does not
preclude the immediate participation of the Company Employees in any
successor plan.

  



  

(f) The Company, Parent and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that all
provisions contained in this Section 5.8 and in Section 3.14 and 3.15
with respect to Company Employees are included for the sole benefit of
Parent, the Purchaser and the Company, and that nothing in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or

  



        
   

  



  

other rights (i) in any other Person, including any Company Employees, former
Company Employees, any participant in any Employee Benefit Plan, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Affiliates. No
provision of this Section 5.8 or Section 3.14 or 3.15 shall constitute
an amendment to any Employee Benefit Plan or any employee benefit or
compensation plan, policy agreement or arrangement of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates.

  



  

Section 5.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

  



  

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide
indemnification and exculpation for (i) each person who is now or has been
prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (ii) those
individuals party to indemnification agreements listed on Section 5.9 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") which is at least
as favorable to such person as the exculpation and indemnification provided
to the Indemnified Parties by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement in the applicable Company Charter,
Company Bylaws, Subsidiaries Governance Documents and the indemnification
agreements set forth in Section 5.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule that

(b) Parent shall either (i) cause to be maintained in effect, for a period of
six years after the Effective Time, the current policy of the Companys
directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance described on

Policy_") covering acts or omissions at or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to those persons who are currently covered by the Current DandO Policy,
or (ii) obtain, in consultation with the Company, a prepaid (or "tail")
directors and officers liability insurance policy covering acts or
omissions at or prior to the Effective Time for a period of six years after
the Effective Time, with respect to those persons who are currently covered
by the Current DandO Policy on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts
no less favorable to such indemnified persons than those of the Current DandO
Policy; _provided_ , that (A) this Section 5.9(b) shall not extend or
otherwise increase obligations of the Company to provide coverage for acts or
omissions of directors or officers of any Person acquired by the Company
prior to the date of this Agreement beyond the terms provided for in the
agreements with respect to such transactions; (B) Parent may substitute one
or more policies for the Current DandO Policy, so long as such substitute
policies have at least the same coverage and amounts and contain terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to the persons currently covered by
the Current DandO Policy; (C) Parent shall not be required to pay any annual
premium for the Current DandO Policy or any substitutes with respect thereto
in excess of 250% of the annual premium to be in effect after the date
hereof; and (D) if the premium for the Current DandO Policy or any
substitutes therefor exceeds such amount, Parent shall purchase a substitute
policy with the greatest coverage available for such 250% amount.

  



  

(c) The obligations under this Section 5.9 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to
whom this Section 5.9 applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Party to
whom this Section 5.9 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 5.9).

  



        
   

  



  

Section 5.10 _Rights Agreement; State Takeover Laws_.

  



  

(a) The Company covenants and agrees that it shall not take any action which
would allow any Person (solely for purposes of this Section 5.10(a), as
defined in the Rights Agreement) other than Parent, the Purchaser, or any
Subsidiary of Parent to acquire " _Beneficial Ownership_ " (solely for
purposes of this Section 5.10(a), as defined in the Rights Agreement) of
15.0% or more of the " _Common Shares_ " without causing a " _Distribution
Date,_ " a " _Shares Acquisition Date_ " or a " _Triggering Event_ " (as each
such term is defined in the Rights Agreement) to occur. The Company
Board shall not make a determination that Parent, the Purchaser or any of
their respective Affiliates or associates, directors, officers or employees
is an " _Acquiring Person_ " for purposes of the Rights Agreement.

  



  

(b) The Company Board shall take all action reasonably necessary to render
(i) Section 2 of Article NINTH of the Company Charter and (ii) any "control
share acquisition", "fair price", "business combination" or other anti-
takeover Law that becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company,
Parent or the Purchaser, the Offer, the Merger, the Support Agreements or the
Top-Up Option, including the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, inapplicable to the
foregoing. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Company
from complying with its obligations under Section 220 of the DGCL.

  



  

Section 5.11 _Parent Agreement Concerning Purchaser_. Parent agrees to cause
the Purchaser to comply with its obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
Board, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall
adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so
that the disposition by any officer or director of the Company who is a
covered Person of the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act
(" _Section 16_") of Shares or Company Stock Options pursuant to this
Agreement, and the Offer and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for
purposes of Section 16.

  



  

Section 5.13 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company (acting through the Compensation Committee of the Company Board)
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause each agreement,
arrangement or understanding entered into by the Company or its Subsidiaries
on or after the date hereof with any of its officers, directors or employees
pursuant to which consideration is paid to such officer, director or employee
to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee
benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the
Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

  



  

Section 5.14 _Actions With Respect to Company s Outstanding Indebtedness_.
 The Company shall cooperate fully with Parent and the Purchaser and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken, all
actions (including making any filings, delivering notices and taking any
actions required by Law), and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable, as may be necessary to effect the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or as Parent may
reasonably request, including taking such actions as are described on
Schedule 5.14. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to

  



        
   

  



  

provide, or shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be provided, in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indentures and the Senior
Credit Facility, as applicable, to the trustees under the Indentures, to each
7½% Noteholder, each holder of Convertible Notes and to Bank of America,
N.A., as administrative agent under the Senior Credit Facility (or any of the
lenders thereunder), any notices and announcements required by any of the
Indentures or the Senior Credit Facility in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as they relate to the 7½% Notes, the
Convertible Notes or the Senior Credit Facility, which must be in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent.  The Company shall: (i) take
all such further actions as may be necessary to comply with all of the terms
and conditions of the Indentures and the Senior Credit Facility in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as they relate to the
7½% Notes, the Convertible Notes or the Senior Credit Facility; and (ii)
after the Acceptance Time, take such other actions with respect to the 7½%
Notes, the Convertible Notes, the Indentures or the Senior Credit Facility as
reasonably requested by Parent, including in connection with any repayment of
the 7½% Notes, the Convertible Notes or the Senior Credit Facility. In the
event that the Company is required under the terms and conditions of
the Convertible Notes Indentures to pay a conversion value with respect to
a Convertible Note surrendered for conversion based on a price per share
of Company Common Stock in excess of the Merger Consideration, the Company
shall provide Parent with supporting documentation detailing the calculation
of such conversion value, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, and Parent shall have a reasonable opportunity to review and comment

Section 8.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  



  

Section 8.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to any valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, (a) each party
shall be entitled at its election to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity, (b) the parties waive any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond, guarantee or other undertaking in connection
with the obtaining of any specific performance or injunctive relief and (c)
the parties shall waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense
of adequacy of a remedy at Law.  Either partys pursuit of specific
performance at any time shall not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver
of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be
entitled, including the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages
incurred or suffered by such party in the case of a breach of this Agreement
involving fraud or willful or intentional misconduct. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, with respect to the Company the provisions of this Section
8.13 are subject to the damage limitation set forth in Section 7.3.

Effect" or similar terms set forth therein, or references to
"substantial compliance" or "substantial conformity" or similar terms
contained in Sections 3.20, 3.21 and 3.23) except where the failure to be so
true and correct does not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect as if
such representations and warranties were made at the time of such
determination (except to the extent such representations and warranties
relate to an earlier date, in which case only as of such earlier date);

circumstances giving rise to any such conditions and may be waived by Parent
or the Purchaser in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in
their sole discretion (except the Minimum Condition may not be waived), in
each case, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The failure by
Parent or the Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights
shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time
to time.
