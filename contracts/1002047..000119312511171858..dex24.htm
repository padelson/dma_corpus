1.3 Other Definitional and Interpretive Matters

Unless otherwise expressly provided, for purposes of this Agreement, the
following rules of interpretation shall apply:

(a) _Calculation of Time Period_. When calculating the period of time before
which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken
pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the starting reference date in
calculating such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a
non-Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding
Business Day.

(b) _Gender and Number_. Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall
include all genders, and words imparting the singular number only shall
include the plural and vice versa.

(c)  _Headings_. The provision of a Table of Contents, the division of this
Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions and the insertion of
headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect or be
utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All references in this
Agreement to any " _Section_ " are to the corresponding Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise specified.

 

(d) _Herein_. The words such as " _herein_ ," " _hereinafter_ ," " _hereof_ ,"
and " _hereunder_ " refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a
subdivision in which such words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

(e) _Including_. The word " _including_ " or any variation thereof means
"including, without limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any
general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters
immediately following it.

States dollars.

(g) _Reasonable Commercial Efforts_. Reasonable commercial efforts means that
the obligated party is required to make a diligent, reasonable and good faith
effort to accomplish the applicable objective. Such obligation, however, does
not require an expenditure of funds or the incurrence of a liability on the
part of the obligated party, nor does it require that the obligated party act
in a manner that would be contrary to normal commercial practices in order to
accomplish the objective. The fact that the objective is or is not actually
accomplished is not, by itself, an indication that the obligated party did or
did not in fact utilize its reasonable commercial efforts in attempting to
accomplish the objective.

(h)  _Schedules and Exhibits_. The Schedules and Exhibits attached to this
Agreement shall be construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to
the same extent as if the same had been set forth verbatim herein. Any matter
disclosed by either party on any one Schedule with respect to any
representation, warranty or covenant of such party shall be deemed disclosed

2.6 Further Assurances; Further Conveyances and Assumptions; Consent of Third
Parties

(a) From time to time following the Closing to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and subject to reasonable restrictions, Seller shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, make available to Buyer or a Buyer Designee such
confidential data and information in personnel records of Transferred
Employees as is reasonably necessary for Buyer to integrate such employees
into Buyers or a Buyer Designees workforce and comply with its obligations
under Section 5.4.

(b) From time to time following the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, execute, acknowledge and deliver all
such further conveyances, notices, assumptions, releases and acquittances and
such other instruments, and shall take such

 



-19-   further actions, as may be necessary or appropriate to assure fully to Buyer
and its Affiliates and each of their respective successors or assigns, all of
the properties, rights, titles, interests, estates, remedies, powers and
privileges intended to be conveyed to Buyer or a Buyer Designee under this
Agreement and the Collateral Agreements and to assure fully to Seller and its
Affiliates and each of their respective successors and assigns, the
assumption of the liabilities and obligations intended to be assumed by Buyer
or a Buyer Designee under this Agreement and the Collateral Agreements, and to
otherwise make effective the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (including (i) transferring back to Seller or a Subsidiary any asset
or liability not contemplated by this Agreement to be a Purchased Asset or an
Assumed Liability, respectively, which asset or liability was transferred to
Buyer or a Buyer Designee at the Closing, and (ii) transferring to Buyer or a
Buyer Designee any asset or liability contemplated by this Agreement to be a
Purchased Asset or an Assumed Liability, respectively, which was not
transferred to Buyer or a Buyer Designee at the Closing).

(c) Nothing in this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be construed as an attempt or agreement to assign
any Purchased Asset, including any Contract, Lease, License, Governmental
Permit, certificate, approval, authorization or other right, which by its
terms or by Law is nonassignable without the consent of a Third Party or a
Governmental Body or is cancelable by a Third Party in the event of an
assignment (" _Nonassignable Assets_ ") (provided that in the event that Buyer
or a Buyer Designee notifies Seller that any Purchased Asset should be
transferred notwithstanding the right of a Third Party to cancel in the event
of an assignment, then such Purchased Asset that is cancelable by a Third
Party in the event of assignment shall not be included as a Nonassignable
Asset for purposes of this Agreement) unless and until such consents shall
have been obtained. Seller shall use all reasonable commercial efforts to
obtain such consents and deliver any required notices prior to Closing, and
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with Seller to
obtain such consents promptly. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, in
the event consents to the assignment thereof cannot be obtained, Seller and
Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate in a
mutually agreeable arrangement under which (i) Buyer or a Buyer Designee would
obtain the benefits and assume the obligations under such Nonassignable Assets
in accordance with this Agreement including by sub-contracting, sub-
licensing, or sub-leasing to Buyer or a Buyer Designee, or (ii) such
Nonassignable Assets would be held, as of and from the Closing Date, by Seller
or the applicable Subsidiary in trust for Buyer or a Buyer Designee and the
covenants and obligations thereunder would be performed by Buyer or a Buyer
Designee in Sellers or such Subsidiarys name and all benefits and
obligations existing thereunder would be for Buyers or the applicable Buyer
Designees account. Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, also
take or cause to be taken at Buyers or a Buyer Designees expense such
actions in its name or otherwise as Buyer may reasonably request so as to
provide Buyer or the applicable Buyer Designee with the benefits of the
Nonassignable Assets and to effect collection of money or other consideration
that becomes due and payable under the Nonassignable Assets, and Seller or the
applicable Subsidiary shall promptly pay over to Buyer or the applicable
Buyer Designee all money or other consideration received by it in respect to
all Nonassignable Assets. If after the Closing Date any Nonassignable Asset
becomes assignable (either because consent for the assignment thereof is
obtained or otherwise), Seller shall promptly notify Buyer and assign or
transfer such previously Nonassignable Asset to Buyer or the applicable Buyer
Designee.

 



-20-  (d) Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
use their respective reasonable commercial efforts to obtain, or to cause to
be obtained, any consent, substitution, approval, or amendment required to
transfer all rights and obligations under any and all Contracts, Leases,
Licenses, Governmental Permits, certificates, approvals, authorizations or
other rights or obligations or liabilities that constitute Assumed
Liabilities. In the case of any agreements which include obligations with
respect to products of Seller other than Engenio Products (the " _Shared
Contract_ "), Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, obtain consent and amend such agreement to remove any
obligations with respect to such products other than Engenio Products. In the
event such amendment is not obtained prior to the Closing Date, then such
Shared Contract shall be deemed to be a Nonassignable Asset in accordance with
this Section 2.6 ( _provided_ , _however_ , that, in connection with such
Nonassignable Asset, Buyer shall have no obligation to perform any of the
obligations with respect to products other than Engenio Products).

 

(e) As of and from the Closing Date, Seller on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates authorizes Buyer, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
the terms of the Nonassignable Assets, at Buyers expense, to perform all the
obligations and receive all the benefits of Seller or its Affiliates under the
Nonassignable Assets and appoints Buyer its attorney-in-fact to act in its
name on its behalf or in the name of the applicable Affiliate of Seller and on
such Affiliates behalf with respect thereto.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless and
until any consent or approval with respect to any Nonassignable Asset is
obtained, such Nonassignable Asset shall not constitute a Purchased Asset and
any associated liability shall not constitute an Assumed Liability for any
purpose under this Agreement.

 

(g) As reasonably requested by Buyer, Seller will identify the licenses
included in the Nonassignable Assets and shall cooperate with and assist
Buyer, at Buyers reasonable request and expense, to obtain licenses or
arrangements to replace the licenses, services and assets provided with
respect to any Nonassignable Asset.

 

2.7 Intellectual Property and Information

Unless expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Intellectual Property
Agreement or in any Collateral Agreement, no title, right or license of any
kind is granted to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the
Intellectual Property or Information of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller,
either directly or indirectly, by implication, by estoppel or otherwise.

Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller and any Subsidiary with the
requirements and provisions of any " _bulk-transfer_ " Laws of any
jurisdiction (collectively, the " _Bulk Sales Laws_ "), including Article 6 of
the California and Kansas Uniform Commercial Code, in each case that may
otherwise be applicable with respect to the sale of any or all of the
Purchased Assets to Buyer or a Buyer Designee. Seller agrees that the
indemnification obligations set forth in Section 9.3(b)(ii) shall apply
to Buyers waiver of the Bulk Sales Laws.

any Subsidiary such amounts as Buyer or any Buyer Designee is legally
required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any Tax Law with respect to
Taxes resulting from Sellers or any Subsidiarys sale of Purchased Assets in
any jurisdiction; _provided_ _that_ such right to deduct and withhold shall
not apply to any Transfer Taxes allocated to Buyer or a Buyer Designee under
Section 2.9(b). Buyer shall provide Seller with written notice of any
requirement to so deduct or withhold any amount no less than five (5) days
prior to the Closing Date, and shall provide Seller with a receipt from the
applicable Governmental Body documenting the remittance of such deduction or
withholding under the Code or any such Law as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date of such deduction or withholding, but in any event not later
than thirty (30) days following any such payment. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made.

(b) The Party prescribed by applicable Law as primarily liable for the
payment thereof shall be responsible for and timely pay any sales, use, stamp,
registration, documentary, filing, recording, transfer, value added or similar
fees or Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer Taxes) ("
_Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with the transfer of the Purchased
Assets and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities to and by, respectively,
Buyer and Buyer Designees pursuant to this Agreement. In the case and to the
extent of value added and similar Taxes incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby that are recoverable by Buyer or a Buyer
Designee, such Taxes shall be invoiced by Seller or its Subsidiaries to Buyer
or Buyer Designee, as applicable, paid by Buyer or Buyer Designee to Seller
or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and remitted by Seller or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to the relevant Governmental Body in accordance
with applicable Law, and Buyer or Buyer Designee shall be entitled to such
recovery. The Party prescribed by Law as primarily liable for the payment of
such Transfer Taxes shall prepare all necessary documents (including all
Returns) with respect to all such amounts in a timely manner. The applicable
party shall file such Returns and pay such Taxes and shall provide evidence
satisfactory to the other party that such Returns have been filed and Transfer
Taxes have been paid. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to minimize the amount
of Transfer Taxes.

(c) All real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem
obligations (" _Property Taxes_ ") levied with respect to the Purchased
Assets for a Straddle Period shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer
based on the number of days of such Straddle Period, and Seller shall be
liable for the proportionate amount of Property Taxes that is attributable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period within such Straddle Period, and Buyer shall be
liable for the proportionate amount of Property Taxes that is attributable to
the Post-Closing Tax Period within such Straddle Period. Any refund, rebate,
abatement or other recovery of Property Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be for the account of Seller, and any refund, rebate,
abatement or other recovery of Property Taxes attributable to the Post-
Closing Tax Period shall be for the account of Buyer. Upon receipt of any bill
(or any refund, rebate, abatement, or other recovery) for such Property Taxes,
Buyer or Seller, as applicable, shall present a statement to the other
setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which each is entitled under
this

 



-22-   Section 2.9(c) together with such supporting evidence as is reasonably
necessary to calculate the proration amount. The proration amount shall be
paid by the party owing it to the other within ten (10) days after delivery
of such statement. In the event that Buyer or Seller makes any payment for
which it is entitled to reimbursement under this Section 2.9(c), the
applicable party shall make such reimbursement promptly but in no event later
than ten (10) days after the presentation of a statement setting forth the
amount of reimbursement to which the presenting party is entitled along with
such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to calculate the amount
of reimbursement.

(d) Following the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate as reasonably
requested for the purpose of enabling the requesting party to (i) make any
election relating to Taxes, (ii) prepare Returns with respect to the Engenio
Business or the Purchased Assets or (iii) to prepare for and defend audits or
other Tax-related examinations by a Governmental Body with respect to the
Engenio Business and the Purchased Assets. Such cooperation shall be at the
expense of the requesting party.

2.10 Buyer Designee

The Parties agree that Buyer may assign the right to purchase certain of the
Purchased Assets to one or more Buyer Designees or that one or more Buyer
Designees may enter into a Collateral Agreement. Notwithstanding any such
assignment or execution of a Collateral Agreement by a Buyer Designee,
Buyer shall remain liable for, and any such assignment or execution shall not
relieve Buyer of, its obligations hereunder or thereunder. Any reference to
Buyer in this Agreement shall to the extent applicable also be deemed a
reference to the applicable Buyer Designee, except where in context of this
Agreement such use would not be appropriate.

2.11 Performance of Warranty Service; Warranty Reimbursement

Buyer agrees to perform the warranty service arising from sales of Engenio
Products listed on _Schedule 1.1(b)_ on, before or following the Closing

properties or assets or provides such services to Buyer or a Buyer Designee at

applicable Subsidiary shall cooperate and assist in facilitating Buyers or a
Buyer Designees offers and will not take any action, or cause any of the

on _Schedule 3.10(a)(i)_. Buyer or a Buyer Designee shall provide, or
shall cause to be provided, to Transferred Employees either (at Buyers
discretion) employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than

service with Seller or Buyer or their respective Affiliates, as applicable) or
(ii) the employee benefits that they were offered by Seller or the applicable
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing Date as set forth on _Schedule
3.10(b)_. Except as expressly set forth in this Section 5.4, no Benefit Plans
or assets of any Benefit Plan shall be transferred to Buyer or any Affiliate
of Buyer. Buyer will take all action necessary to ensure that, to the extent
permitted under applicable Buyer or Buyer Designee Benefit Plans, such Benefit
Plans shall recognize (i) for purposes of satisfying any deductibles, co-pays
and out-of-pocket maximums during the coverage period that includes the
Closing Date, any payment made by any Transferred Employee towards

-45-   out-of-pocket maximums in any health or other insurance plan of Seller or a
Subsidiary during the coverage period that includes the Closing Date and (ii)
for purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting and, in
the case of any Buyer severance plan or program (if any), benefit accruals,
all service with Seller or a Subsidiary prior to the Closing, including

Subsidiary, provided that such service shall not be recognized to the extent
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Buyer or the

parties based on the portion of the international assignment occurring before
or on the Closing Date (which shall be Sellers or the applicable
Subsidiarys obligation) and after the Closing Date (which shall be Buyers or
the applicable Buyer Designees obligation).

(d) Seller and Buyer intend that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall not constitute a severance of employment, under the terms of
any Benefit Plan of Seller of any Subsidiary, of any Transferred Employee
prior to or upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
that such employees will have continuous and uninterrupted employment
immediately before and immediately after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall
provide, at a minimum, severance benefits substantially equivalent to the
benefits contained in the plans listed or as described on _Schedule 5.4(d)_ to
Transferred Employees whose employment is terminated involuntarily by Buyer
on or before March 31, 2012 other than terminations in circumstances that
would not require payments of severance benefits under Sellers severance
plan.

 

(e) To the extent permitted under applicable Buyer Benefit Plans, (i) Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to waive any pre-existing condition
exclusion (to the extent such exclusion was waived under applicable health and

of an eligible rollover distribution from the LSI Corporation 401(k) Plan,
provided such rollovers are made at the election of the Transferred Employees
and in accordance with the terms of the Buyer Savings Plan. Seller shall cause
the LSI Corporation 401(k) Plan to fully vest Transferred Employees in their
accounts immediately prior to the Closing and permit the Transferred Employees
to elect a lump sum cash distribution of benefits accrued through the Closing
Date in accordance with the Code.

if any, earned by the Transferred Employees for the period from January 1,
2011 to and including the Closing Date under the applicable incentive plans in
effect for any such period (including any pro rata amount with respect to such
period under a plan or program ending or vesting on or after the Closing
Date). Buyer shall not assume or otherwise become liable for, and Seller shall
not transfer to Buyer, any liabilities of Seller with respect to accrued but
unused vacation and sabbatical leave (collectively, the " _Accrued Amounts_
"). At the Closing, Seller shall pay to each Transferred Employee the Accrued
Amount with respect to such Transferred Employee; provided, that with respect
to Transferred Employees in the European Union, Seller shall pay to Buyer
each such Transferred Employees applicable Accrued Amount, including for the
avoidance of doubt, any applicable employees and employers social
contributions, in each case to the extent required pursuant to applicable
Law.

with a schedule setting forth the number of employees and the work location

applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 5.4, expressed or implied, shall
confer upon any employee or former employee of Seller or any Subsidiary or
related entities (including, without limitation, the Transferred Employees)
any rights or remedies (including, without limitation, any right to employment
or continued employment for any specified period) of any nature or kind
whatsoever, under or by reason of this Section 5.4. It is expressly agreed
that the provisions of this Section 5.4 are not intended to be for the benefit
of or otherwise be enforceable by, any third party, including, without
limitation, any Transferred Employees. No provision of this Section 5.4 shall
create any rights in any such persons in respect of any benefits that may be
provided under any Benefit Plan or any plan or arrangement which may be
established or maintained by Buyer, shall be construed to establish, amend, or
modify an Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement nor shall require Seller, Buyer or any Affiliate of Seller or
Buyer to continue or amend any particular benefit plan and any such plan may
be amended or terminated in accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

continue the activities of its RAID adapter business 

 



-51-   which develops LSI® MegaRAID® and 3ware® storage controllers and software
and the ONStor clustered NAS gateway and non-integrated file storage products
business of Seller which develops ONStor Products, and (ii) purchase or
otherwise acquire by merger, purchase of assets, stock (including investing as

(b) Seller acknowledges that the restrictions set forth in Section 5.11(a)
constitute a material inducement to Buyers entering into and performing this
Agreement. Seller further acknowledges, stipulates and agrees that a breach of
such obligation could result in irreparable harm and continuing damage to
Buyer for which there may be no adequate remedy at Law and further agrees that
in the event of any breach of said obligation, Buyer may be entitled to
injunctive relief and to such other relief as is proper under the
circumstances. 

(c) If any provision contained in this Section shall for any reason be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Section
5.11, but this Section 5.11 shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention
of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein
is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not
permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or
to any extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void
and of no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or
enforceable under applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall
construe and interpret or reform this Section 5.11 to provide for a covenant
having the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other
provisions (not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and
enforceable under such applicable Law.

be made on the basis of the actual number of days of the month that shall have
elapsed as of the Closing Date and based upon a 365-day year. The amount of

cooperate and use their good faith efforts to make such adjustments.

5.14 Notification of Certain Matters

Seller shall give prompt written notice to Buyer of (a) the occurrence or

9\. Indemnification

The rights and obligations of Buyer and Seller under this Agreement shall be
subject to the following terms and conditions:

 

9.1 Effect of Investigation

The right to indemnification or other remedy of Buyer or its Affiliates
hereunder based on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
herein will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to,
or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being

 



-59-   acquired) at any time, by the Buyer or its Affiliates, whether before or
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

9.2 Survival of Representations and Warranties 

The representations and warranties of Buyer and Seller contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing solely for purposes of this Article 9 and
such representations and warranties shall terminate at the close of business
on the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the representations and warranties in Section 3.7(d)
with respect to environmental matters and the representations and warranties
relating to Tax and ERISA matters shall survive the Closing and shall
terminate at the close of business on the 120th day following the expiration
of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the environmental,
Tax or ERISA liabilities in question (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation
or extension thereof), (ii) the representations and warranties in Section 3.13
shall terminate at the close of business on the date that is twenty-four (24)
months after the Closing Date and (iii) the representations and warranties in
Section 3.2 with respect to authorization and Section 3.5(a) with respect to
title shall survive indefinitely. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any
liability whatsoever with respect to any such representations or warranties
after the applicable expiration date; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the obligations of Buyer or
Seller to indemnify and hold harmless any Indemnified Party shall not
terminate with respect to any claim or right to indemnification as to which
such Indemnified Party shall have made in good faith and with reasonable
specificity under the circumstances before the applicable expiration date,
provided notice to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Article 9
and, in such case, such claim or right to indemnification shall survive
indefinitely until such claim has been finally resolved.

9.3 General Agreement to Indemnify

 

(a) Seller and Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party
hereto, and Affiliates thereof, and any director, officer, employee or agent
of such other party or Affiliates thereof (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ")
from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, liabilities,
obligations, losses, and damages, amounts paid in settlement, interest, costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, court costs and other out-
of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending the
foregoing) (collectively, " _Losses_ ") incurred or suffered by any
Indemnified Party to the extent that the Losses arise by reason of, or result
from (i) subject to Section 9.2, any breach or any failure of any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement or any
certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement to have been true
when made and at and as of the Closing Date, or (ii) the breach by such party
of any covenant or agreement of such party contained in this Agreement to the
extent not waived by the other party.

(b) Seller further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and Affiliates
thereof, and any director, officer, employee or agent of Buyer or Affiliates
thereof (each a " _Buyer Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any Losses
incurred by Buyer or any Buyer Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting
from, or relating to: (i) the Excluded Liabilities; (ii) Buyers waiver of,
or noncompliance with, any applicable Bulk Sales Laws; and (iii) any claim,
demand or

 



-60-   liability for Taxes relating to, pertaining to, or arising out of the
Engenio Business or the Purchased Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

(c) Buyer further agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and Affiliates
thereof, and any director, officer, employee or agent of Seller or Affiliates
thereof (each a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any Losses
incurred by Seller or any Seller Indemnified Party arising out of, resulting
from, or relating to: (i) any failure of Buyer to discharge any of the
Assumed Liabilities; and (ii) any claim, demand or liability for Taxes
relating to, pertaining to, or arising out of the Engenio Business or the
Purchased Assets for any Post-Closing Tax Period.

 

(d) Amounts payable in respect of the parties indemnification obligations
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and
shall be treated as such by Buyer and Seller on their Returns to the extent
permitted by law. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party (as defined below)
chooses to defend or prosecute any Third-Party Claim (as defined below),
both parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and
shall furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith or as provided in Section 5.1.

(e) The indemnification obligations of each party hereto under this Article 9
shall inure to the benefit of the directors, officers and Affiliates of the
other party hereto on the same terms as are applicable to such other party.

(f) The Indemnifying Partys liability for all claims made under Section
9.3(a)(i) shall be subject to the following limitations: (i) the Indemnifying
Party shall have no liability for such claims until the aggregate amount of
the Losses incurred shall exceed five tenths of one percent (0.5%) of the
Purchase Price (the " _Threshold Amount_ ") in which case the Indemnifying
Party shall be liable for the entire amount of such Losses (subject to the
limit set forth in clause (ii)) and not just the amount of the Losses that
exceeds the Threshold Amount, and (ii) the Indemnifying Partys aggregate
liability for all such claims shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the
Purchase Price (the " _Cap Amount_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , in no event
shall the limitations in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 9.3(f) apply to
(a) Losses resulting from fraud or intentional misrepresentation or (b)
Losses arising out of breaches of the representations and warranties set forth
in Sections 3.3, 3.5(a) and 3.20. The Indemnified Party may not make a claim
for indemnification under Section 9.3(a)(i) after the expiration of the
applicable survival period specified in Section 9.2; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, so long as such
Indemnified Party shall have, before the applicable expiration date, provided
notice of a claim (made in good faith and with reasonable specificity under
the circumstances) before the applicable expiration date to the Indemnifying
Party in accordance with this Article 9, then, in such case, such claim or
right to indemnification shall survive indefinitely until such claim has been
finally resolved. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for
purposes of this Article 9, all "materiality", "Seller Material
Adverse Effect" and similar qualifications in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement (or contained, incorporated or
referenced in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement) shall be
disregarded for purposes of calculating the amount of such Losses, but shall
not be disregarded for purposes of determining whether a breach of any such
representation or warranty

 



-61-   contained in this Agreement (or contained, incorporated or referenced in any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement) has occurred.

 

(g) The indemnification provided in this Article 9 shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy after the Closing Date for damages available to the parties
to this Agreement for breach of any of the terms, conditions, covenants,
representations or warranties contained herein or any right, claim or action
arising from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , this exclusive remedy for damages does not preclude a party from
bringing an action for (i) specific performance or other equitable remedy to
require a party to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any
Collateral Agreement or (ii) fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no
party shall be liable to the other party for indirect, special, punitive,
exemplary or consequential loss or damage arising out of this Agreement,
_provided_ , _however_ , the foregoing shall not be construed to preclude
recovery by the Indemnified Party in respect of Losses directly incurred from
Third Party Claims. Both parties shall mitigate their damages.

(i) The rights to indemnification under this Section 9.3 shall not be subject
to set-off for any claim by the Indemnifying Party against any Indemnified
Party, whether or not arising from the same event giving rise to such
Indemnified Partys claim for indemnification.

9.4 General Procedures for Indemnification 

(a) The Indemnified Party seeking indemnification under this Agreement shall
promptly notify the party against whom indemnification is sought (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of
any action, suit or proceeding by any Third Party, in respect of which
indemnity may be sought hereunder and shall give the Indemnifying Party such
information with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably
request, but failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of any liability hereunder (unless and to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party has suffered material prejudice by such failure). If
the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, but not
the obligation, exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within
twenty (20) days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified Party of the
commencement of or assertion of any claim, action, suit or proceeding by a
Third Party in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder (a "
_Third-Party Claim_ "), to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim only
if such Third-Party Claim (i) involves (and continues to involve) solely money
damages or (ii) involves (and continues to involve) claims for both money
damages and equitable relief against the Indemnified Party that cannot be
severed, where the claims for money damages are the primary claims asserted by
the Third Party and the claims for equitable relief are incidental to the
claims for money damages; _provided further_ , that in the case where Seller
is the Indemnifying Party, as additional requirements in addition to the
foregoing, the Seller shall only be permitted to assume the defense of such
Third-Party Claim in the event that the monetary damages that are sought (or
that would reasonably be expected to be sought) in connection with such Third-
Party Claim do not exceed the Cap Amount or such lesser remaining amount after
deducting therefrom the amount of all other previously paid and outstanding
unpaid and/or unresolved claims pursuant to

 



-62-   this Article 9. If the Indemnifying Party has not acknowledged in writing
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to assume and control the defense against such Third
Party Claim. In the event that any party exercises its right to undertake any
such defense against any Third Party Claim as provided above, then the other
parties shall cooperate in such defense and make available at such
cooperating party expense all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in such partys possession and control relating thereto as is
reasonably required to by the party conducting the defense.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall
have the right to participate in (but not control), at its own expense, the
defense of any Third-Party Claim that the other is defending, as provided in
this Agreement.

(c) The Indemnifying Party, if it has assumed the defense of any Third-Party
Claim as provided in this Agreement, shall not consent to a settlement of, or
the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Third-Party Claim without the
Indemnified Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement or
judgment relates solely to monetary damages and, in addition, in the case
where Seller is the Indemnifying Party, such monetary damages do not exceed
the Cap Amount or such lesser remaining amount after deducting therefrom the
amount of all other previously paid and outstanding unpaid and/or unresolved
claims pursuant to this Article 9. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the Indemnified Partys prior written consent, enter into any compromise or
settlement that (i) commits the Indemnified Party to take, or to forbear to
take, any action, or (ii) does not provide for a complete release by such
Third Party of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the
sole and exclusive right to settle any Third-Party Claim, on such terms and
conditions as it deems reasonably appropriate, to the extent such Third-
Party Claim involves equitable or other non-monetary relief against the
Indemnified Party, and shall have the right to settle any Third-Party Claim
involving money damages for which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the
defense pursuant to this Section 9.4 with the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

(d) In the event an Indemnified Party shall claim a right to payment pursuant
to this Agreement, such Indemnified Party shall send written notice of such
claim to the Indemnifying Party; but failure to give such notice shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder (unless and to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party has suffered material prejudice by such
failure). Such notice shall specify the basis for such claim, the amount
thereof, if known, and the method of computation thereof, all with reasonable
particularity and shall contain a reference to the provisions of this
Agreement in respect of which such a claim shall be incurred. Such notice
shall be given promptly after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of the
basis for each such a claim. The Indemnifying Party shall, within thirty (30)
days after receipt of such notice of an indemnified Loss, and subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 9.3, (i) pay or cause to be paid to the
Indemnified Party the amount of such Loss specified in such notice which the
Indemnifying Party does not contest, or (ii) notify the Indemnified Party if
it wishes to contest the existence or amount of part or all of such a Loss by
stating with particularity the basis upon which it contests the existence or
amount thereof.

writing by the party to be bound thereby, and in accordance with Section 11.3.

 

10.4 Assignment; Binding Effect; Severability

This Agreement may not be assigned by any party hereto without the other
partys written consent; provided, that Buyer may transfer or assign in whole
or in part to one or more Buyer Designee its right to purchase all or a
portion of the Purchased Assets, but no such transfer or assignment will

representatives and permitted assigns of each party hereto. The provisions of
this Agreement are severable, and in the event that any one or more provisions
are deemed illegal or unenforceable the remaining provisions shall remain in
full force and effect unless the deletion of such provision shall cause this
Agreement to become materially adverse to either party, in which event the
parties shall use reasonable commercial efforts to arrive at an accommodation
that best preserves for the parties the benefits and obligations of the
offending provision.

10.5 Governing Law

 

THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS
PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN THAT STATE, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE CHOICE OF LAWS
PRINCIPLES OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, AS TO ALL MATTERS, INCLUDING MATTERS OF

10.6 Consent to Jurisdiction

Each of Buyer and Seller irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
(i) the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, and (ii) the

purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement
or any transaction contemplated hereby (and each agrees that no such action,
suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
hereby shall be brought by it or any of its Affiliates except in such courts).
Buyer further agrees, and Seller further agrees, that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such Persons
respective address set forth in Section 10.1 above shall be effective service
of process for any action, suit or proceeding in New York with respect to any
matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the
immediately preceding sentence. Each of Buyer and Seller irrevocably and
unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim), any objection to
the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in (i) the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, New York County, or (ii) the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York or that any such action,
suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

 



-65-  10.7 Waiver of Jury Trial

 

Each party hereby waives, and agrees to cause each of its Affiliates to waive,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a
trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising out
of, under or in connection with this Agreement. Each party (i) certifies that
no representative of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce

hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 10.7.

approval of the other, make any press release or other announcement concerning
the existence of this Agreement or the terms of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except as and to the extent that any such party shall be so
obligated by Law, in which case the other party shall be advised and the
parties shall use their reasonable commercial efforts to cause a mutually
agreeable release or announcement to be issued; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing shall not preclude, or require notification to the other Party
of, communications or disclosures necessary to comply with accounting, stock
exchange or federal securities or labor relations Law disclosure obligations.

10.10 No Third-Party Beneficiaries

 

Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall (a)
confer on any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors
or assigns (other than the right to indemnification of Indemnified Parties
hereunder) any rights (including Third-Party beneficiary rights), remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement or (b)

(a)  _Mutual Consent_. The mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;

(b) _Failure of Buyer Condition_. Buyer upon written notice to Seller if any
of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 8.2 shall have become
incapable of fulfillment by the Termination Date and shall not have been
waived in writing by Buyer;

 

(c) _Failure of Seller Condition_. Seller upon written notice to Buyer if any
of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Section 8.3 shall have become
incapable of fulfillment by the Termination Date and shall not have been
waived in writing by Seller;

(d) _Court or Administrative Order_. Buyer or Seller if (i) there shall be in
effect a final, non-appealable order of a court or government administrative
agency of competent jurisdiction prohibiting the consummation of the

breach in any material respect of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

11.2 Effect of Termination

In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section

liability on the part of any party or its directors, officers or
stockholders, except for the obligations of the parties hereto as provided in
Article 6 relating to the obligations of Buyer and Seller to keep confidential
certain information, Section 10.2 relating to certain expenses, Section 10.9
relating to publicity and this Section 11.2. Nothing in this Section 11.2

willful and material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement hereunder prior to termination.

11.3 Amendment and Waiver

 

The Agreement may be amended with respect to any provision contained herein at
any time prior to the Closing Date by action of the parties hereto taken by
their Boards of Directors or by their duly authorized officers or employees,
whether before or after such partys action. Any term or condition hereof may
be waived and at any time prior to the Closing Date by the party hereto which
is entitled to the benefits thereof by action taken by its Board of Directors
or its duly authorized officer or employee, whether before or after the action
of such party. Any such amendment or waiver shall be evidenced by a written
instrument duly executed on behalf of each party by its duly authorized
officer or employee. The failure of either party to enforce at

 



-67-   any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a
waiver of such provision nor shall it in any way affect the validity of this
Agreement or the right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every
such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to
constitute a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.

 



-68-  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each party has caused this Agreement to be duly executed
on its behalf by its duly authorized officer as of the date first written
above.
