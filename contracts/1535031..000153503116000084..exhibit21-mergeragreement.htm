Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares represented by a Certificate promptly upon (i) surrender
to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and
validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may
reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent or Parent, or (ii) receipt of an
"agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Paying Agent or Parent may reasonably request) in the case of
a book-entry transfer of Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, each
Share and each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for
all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration and no other
rights or interests whatsoever. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the
cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of such Certificate.



(c)Unregistered Transferees. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to
be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i)
either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay
to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid
or is not payable.



(d)No Other Rights. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates and from and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide the holder of such Certificates with such instructions as may be
necessary to permit such holder to receive the Merger Consideration to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to the Merger.



(e)Termination of the Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares six (6) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any
such holder who has not exchanged Shares for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this Section 2.07 prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation as a general creditor thereof for payment of
the Merger Consideration.



Section 2.08 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.06 or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled
to appraisal and who has properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights for
such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL ("Dissenting Shares")
shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but
instead shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a
holder of Dissenting Shares; provided, however, that if, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to timely perfect, effectively withdraws or loses such
holder's right to appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to
the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall immediately
cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be treated as if they had been Shares
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.06(a), without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly
representing such Share. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, any
withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL that relate to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity
and right to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to
such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company
shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, or
otherwise negotiate any such demands.



Section 2.09 Treatment of Options and RSUs.



(a)Treatment of Options. At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option,
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such
Company Stock Option to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to
the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to the Company Stock Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price of such Company Stock
Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payment pursuant to Section 2.11; provided that any such Company Stock Option
with respect to which the per-share exercise price subject thereto is equal to
or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be canceled in exchange for no
consideration. The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders of Company Stock Options the cash
payments described in this Section 2.09(a) through its payroll provider on or
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event no
later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date for the Continuing
Company Employees following the Closing Date. From and after the Effective
Time, no Company Stock Option shall be exercisable, and each Company Stock
Option shall only entitle the holder thereof to the payment provided for in
this Section 2.09(a).



(b)Treatment of Company Service RSUs. At the Effective Time, each Company
Service RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, whether
vested or unvested, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such
Company Service RSU to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to
the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to the Company Service RSU multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment pursuant
to Section 2.11. The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders of Company Service RSUs the cash
payments described in this Section 2.09(b) through its payroll provider (or
other appropriate means for each holder who is a non-employee director) on or
as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event no
later than the first regularly scheduled payroll date for the Continuing
Company Employees following the Closing Date.



(c)Treatment of Company Performance RSUs. At the Effective Time, each Company
Performance RSU outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
whether vested or unvested, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder
of such Company Performance RSU to receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company
Performance RSU (assuming target-level performance) multiplied by (y) the
Merger Consideration, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with
respect to such payment pursuant to Section 2.11. The Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders
of Company Performance RSUs the cash payments described in this Section
2.09(c) through its payroll provider on or as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Closing Date, but in any event no later than the first regularly
scheduled payroll date for the Continuing Company Employees following the
Closing Date.



(d)Corporate Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any
actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.09(a),
Section 2.09(b) and Section 2.09(c), it being understood and agreed that from
and after the Effective Time, no Company Stock Award holder shall have any
right with respect to any Company Stock Award other than to receive the
payment provided for in this Section 2.09. No later than the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide to the Surviving Corporation all funds necessary to
fulfill the obligations under this Section 2.09.



Section 2.10 Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend, all references herein to specified numbers of shares affected
thereby, and any calculations that are based upon such numbers of shares
affected thereby, including the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement, shall be appropriately adjusted. Nothing
in this Section 2.10 shall be construed as permitting the Company to take any
action that is otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.



Section 2.11 Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
from such payment under any provision of any applicable Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such
amounts shall be (i) timely remitted by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable
Taxing Authority, and (ii) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
made such deduction and withholding.



Section 2.12 No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to and in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Applicable Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered
immediately prior to such date on which any amounts payable pursuant to this
Article 2 would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.13 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person
of a bond, in such customary amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may direct,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as
contemplated under this Article 2.



Section 2.14 Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.

Section 4.05 Internal Controls and Procedures.

(a)The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) that ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company's management has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the

of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to
statements made therein based on information supplied by the Company in
writing expressly for inclusion therein. The Parent Shareholder Circular will
comply in all material respects as to form with the requirements of the
Listing Rules.



Section 5.06 Finders or Brokers. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has employed any investment banker, broker or finder in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement who would be entitled to any fee
or commission for which the Company may become liable prior to the Effective
Time.



Section 5.07 Financing.



(a)Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of (i) the
executed debt commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, by
and among the lenders and financial institutions party thereto (the "Financing
Sources") and Parent providing for debt financing as described by such
commitment letter (such commitment letter, including all exhibits, schedules,
annexes and amendments thereto, the "Commitment Letter") and (ii) the related
fee letter referred to in the Commitment Letter (redacted for provisions
related to fees, flex terms and other economic terms, the "Fee Letter" and,
together with the Commitment Letter, the "Commitment Documents"), in each case
as amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended from time to time
after the date of this Agreement in compliance with the terms hereof, pursuant
to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letter, certain of the Financing Sources have agreed to lend the
amounts set forth therein, for the purpose of financing the Merger.



(b)As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Documents are in full
force and effect and are valid and binding obligations of Parent and, to the
knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with
their respective terms (subject to the Enforceability Exceptions), and are not
subject to any conditions precedent related to the funding of the net proceeds
of the Debt Financing that are not set forth in the copies of the Commitment
Letter and the Fee Letter provided to the Company. 

(c)The Commitment Documents have not been amended or modified prior to the
date of this Agreement and the respective commitments contained therein have
not been, to the knowledge of Parent, terminated, reduced, withdrawn or
rescinded prior to the date of this Agreement.



(d)As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Financing Sources has
notified Parent of its intention to terminate the Commitment Documents or not
to provide the Debt Financing.



(e)As of the date of this Agreement, Parent is not in default or breach under
the terms and conditions of the Commitment Documents and no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be
expected to constitute a default or breach by Parent under the terms and
conditions of the Commitment Documents or a failure of any condition to the
obligations of the Financing Sources in the Commitment Documents or otherwise
result in any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated thereby to be
unavailable. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe
that it or any other party thereto will be unable to satisfy any of the
conditions to the Debt Financing to be satisfied pursuant to the Commitment
Documents on the Closing Date or that the Debt Financing will not be available
in full to Parent on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provisions of this Agreement, Parent is not making any representation or
warranty regarding the effect of the inaccuracy of the representations or
warranties set forth in Article 4 or non-compliance by the Company and its
Affiliates with their respective obligations hereunder on any such condition
to the Debt Financing.



(f)As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters, understandings
or other agreements relating to the Debt Financing to which Parent or any of
its Affiliates is a party that could affect the availability or aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date, other than those set forth
in the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter.



(g)Parent or an Affiliate thereof on its behalf has fully paid any and all
commitment or other fees required by the Commitment Documents to be paid prior
to the date of this Agreement.



(h)Assuming (i) the accuracy of the representations or warranties set forth in
Article 4 to the extent necessary to satisfy the condition in Section 7.02(a),
(ii) the compliance by the Company and its Affiliates with their respective
obligations hereunder and (iii) the conditions set forth in Sections 7.01 and
7.02 are satisfied at the Closing, the net proceeds contemplated by the
Commitment Letter, together with available cash on hand of Parent, when funded
in accordance with the Commitment Letter on the Closing Date will, in the
aggregate, provide Parent and/or any Subsidiary of Parent with sufficient
immediately available cash funds to consummate the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement and any other amounts required to be paid in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
and to pay all related fees and expenses required to be paid as of the date of
the consummation of the Merger.



Section 5.08 Merger Sub. Merger Sub is a wholly owned indirect Subsidiary of
Parent. Since its date of incorporation, Merger Sub has not carried on any
business nor conducted any operations other than the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
performance of its obligations hereunder and matters ancillary thereto.



Section 5.09 Ownership of Company Common Stock. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is, or has been at any time during the period commencing three
(3) years prior to the date hereof through the date hereof, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company, as such term is defined in Section 203 of the
DGCL.

(a)Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.02, during the Pre-Closing
Period, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and
their directors, officers and employees, and shall direct and otherwise use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective other
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit,

result in an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) other than informing Third Parties of
the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 6.02, participate or
engage in negotiations or discussions (other than, for a period of no more than four (4)

NY) after receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, solely to the extent necessary
for the Company Board to be able to have sufficient information to make the
determination described in Section 6.02(b), to ascertain facts or clarify
terms with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach (other than in any immaterial respect) of this Section 6.02), or

proposed Acquisition Transaction and (D) enforce, and not waive or modify, the
provisions of any existing confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement entered
into with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or any potential Acquisition
Transaction, including any standstill provisions contained therein. The
Company shall ensure that its Representatives and the Representatives of its
Affiliates are aware of the provisions of this Section 6.02, and it is agreed
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.02 by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Affiliates shall constitute a
breach of this Section 6.02 by the Company. The Company hereby releases Parent
from its obligation to comply with the standstill provisions contained in
Section 6 of the Confidentiality Agreement from and after the date hereof.



(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if,
at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company receives an unsolicited, written bona fide Acquisition
Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement
and did not result from a breach (other than in any immaterial respect) of
this Section 6.02), the Company, the Company Board and its Representatives
may, subject to compliance with this Section 6.02(b), engage in negotiations
or discussions with, or furnish any information and reasonable access to, any
Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives if, and
only if, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Company's outside legal counsel and outside independent financial
advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to result in, a Superior Proposal; provided, that (i) prior to
providing access to or furnishing any such information, the Company (A)
receives from such Third Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement or (B) if such Third Party is already party with the Company to a
valid and existing confidentiality agreement as of the date of this Agreement,
amends such existing agreement so that it is an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, (ii) any such information so furnished has been previously provided to Parent or is provided
(including through the Data Room) to Parent substantially concurrently with it
being so furnished to such Third Party and (iii) the Company shall give Parent
written notice of such determination promptly after the Company Board makes
such determination (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after
such determination) and in any event prior to furnishing any such information
or engaging in such negotiations or discussions.



(c)Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.02(d) and the last sentence of
this Section 6.02(c), during the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or qualify or modify in any
manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to withdraw (or so qualify or
modify), the Company Recommendation, (B) fail to include the Company
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (C) take any action to exempt any
Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) from the provisions of Section

regulation, (D) fail to recommend, in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement
on Schedule 14D-9, against any Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D

Acquisition Proposal or any material amendment of such Acquisition Proposal,
or (E) approve, adopt or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or propose
publicly to approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in this clause (i) is referred to herein as a "Change in
Recommendation") or (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to execute or enter into any Contract or other agreement or understanding
(written or oral, binding or non-binding, preliminary or definitive), other
than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to the extent expressly permitted
by Section 6.02(b)) with any Third Party constituting or relating to, or that
is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in, any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, or requiring, or reasonably
expected to cause, the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to
consummate, or that would otherwise impede, interfere with or be inconsistent
with this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the Company to fail to
comply with this Agreement (any such document, agreement or arrangement, an
"Alternative Acquisition Agreement"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite
Company Stockholder Approval, in the event a material development or material
change in circumstances (other than relating to or in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal, Acquisition Transaction or Superior Proposal) occurs or
arises after the date of this Agreement that was not known and not reasonably
foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement, the Company
Board may make a Change in Recommendation (under clause (A) or (D) of the
definition thereof) if and only if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and outside
independent financial advisors, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under Applicable Law; provided, that the Company shall have
provided Parent four (4) Business Days' prior written notice advising Parent
that it intends to take such action and specifying, in reasonable detail, the
reasons for such action and: 

(i)during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent (and the
Company shall have caused its Affiliates and its and their directors, officers
and employees and directed and otherwise used its reasonable best efforts to
cause its and their other Representatives, including, without limitation, its
outside legal counsel and outside independent financial advisors, to have
engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives)
regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement; and



(ii)the Company shall have considered any adjustments to this Agreement
(including a change to the price terms hereof) and any other agreements that
may be proposed in writing by Parent (the "Proposed Changed Terms") no later
than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day of such
fourth (4th) Business Day period and shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and outside independent
financial advisors) that the failure to make a Change in Recommendation would
be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties to the stockholders
of the Company under Applicable Law.



(d)At any time prior to receipt of the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval,
if, in response to an unsolicited, written bona fide Acquisition Proposal
first made after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach
(other than in any immaterial respect) of this Section 6.02, the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and outside independent financial advisors) that (i) such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) the failure to approve or recommend
such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent with the Company Board's
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law, the
Company may terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(d)(i) and
this Section 6.02(d); provided, however, that the Company shall not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(i) and this Section 6.02(d) unless
the Company (x) has complied with and not breached (other than in any
immaterial respect) its obligations under this Section 6.02, including its
obligations set forth in Section 6.02(e), (y) pays, or causes to be paid, to
Parent the Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 8.03(a)(ii)
prior to or concurrently with such termination and (z) concurrently with such
termination, enters into a definitive written Alternative Acquisition
Agreement that documents all the terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal.



(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
6.02(d) or Section 8.01(d)(i), unless (x) the Company shall have provided to
Parent four (4) Business Days' prior written notice (the "Superior Proposal
Notice") advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action (and
specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such action and the terms
and conditions of any such Superior Proposal, including the identity of the
Third Party who has made such Superior Proposal) and provided Parent a copy of
the relevant proposed transaction agreement or the latest draft thereof
(including any related financing commitments and fee letters) or, if no such
agreement or draft exists, a written summary of the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal, and any other related available
documentation and correspondence relating to such Superior Proposal (including
any related financing commitments and fee letters), and (y): 

(i)during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent (and the
Company shall have caused its Affiliates and its and their directors, officers
and employees and directed its and their other Representatives, including,
without limitation, its outside legal counsel and outside independent
financial advisors, to have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent and
its Representatives) regarding changes to the terms of this Agreement intended
to cause such Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal; and

(ii)the Company shall have considered any Proposed Changed Terms proposed by
Parent no later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the fourth (4th)
Business Day of such four (4) Business Day period and shall have determined in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and outside
independent financial advisors) that the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if such Proposed Changed Terms were to be given
effect.

The parties acknowledge and agree that, (A) if Parent, within four (4)
Business Days following its receipt of a Superior Proposal Notice, makes a
proposal that, as determined in good faith by the Company Board (after
consultation with its outside counsel and outside independent financial
advisors), results in the applicable Acquisition Proposal no longer being a
Superior Proposal, then the Company shall have no right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6.02(d) or Section 8.01(d)(i) as a result of
such Acquisition Proposal, and (B) any (1) revisions to the financials terms
or any other material terms of a Superior Proposal or (2) revisions to the
financial terms or any other material terms to an Acquisition Proposal that
the Company Board had determined no longer constitutes a Superior Proposal,
shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal and shall in each case require the
Company to deliver to Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice and a new four (4)
Business Day period shall commence thereafter; provided, however, that such
new four (4) Business Day notice period shall be shortened to the longer of
three (3) Business Days and the time remaining on the prior notice period if
the only change to the material terms of such Superior Proposal is an increase
in (without any change to the form of) the per share merger consideration. The
Company shall have no right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(d)(i) unless it has complied with the procedures set forth in Section
6.02(d) and this Section 6.02(e).

(a)Subject to Applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries, Company Employees and other Representatives to)
afford Parent's authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to Company
Employees, Representatives, properties, books, Contracts and records and shall
furnish Parent and Merger Sub all financial, operating and other data and
information in the Company's possession as Parent and Merger Sub through their
Representatives may reasonably request; provided, however, that the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to provide access to any
information or documents which would, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company after consultation with its outside legal counsel, (i) violate any
Applicable Law, or (ii) result in a loss or waiver of the attorney-client or
other privilege held by the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries (it
being agreed that the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it
is withholding such information or documents pursuant to clause (i) or clause
(ii) above, and thereafter the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate
to cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably
be expected to waive the applicable privilege or protection or violate the
Applicable Law); provided, further, that any access or investigation pursuant
to this Section 6.03(a) shall be conducted in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business and operations of the Company or any
of the Company's Subsidiaries.



(b)No information or knowledge obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to
Section 6.02, this Section 6.03 or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to
affect or modify any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained
herein, the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the
Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof or otherwise
prejudice in any way the rights and remedies of Parent or Merger Sub
hereunder, nor shall any such information, knowledge or investigation be
deemed to affect or modify Parent's or Merger Sub's reliance on the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements made by the Company in this Agreement.



Section 6.04 Notice of Certain Events. During the Pre-Closing Period, the
Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of:



(a)any notice or other communication received by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or to the Company's Knowledge, any of their respective
Representatives, from any Person alleging that the consent, approval,
permission of or waiver from such party is or may be required in connection
with the Merger;



(b)any notice or other communication received by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives, from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby;
and



(c)any fact, event or circumstance known to it that would be reasonably likely
to result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in Article 7 to be
capable of being satisfied prior to the End Date; provided, that the failure
to deliver any notice pursuant to this Section 6.04(c) shall not be considered
in determining whether the conditions set forth in Article 7 have been
satisfied;

provided, however, that that no notification given pursuant to this Section
6.04 shall (A) limit or otherwise affect any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, obligations or conditions contained in this Agreement,
(B) otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and remedies contained in this
Agreement, (C) be deemed to affect or modify Parent's or Merger Sub's reliance

Company in this Agreement or (D) be deemed to amend or supplement the Company
Disclosure Schedules or prevent or cure any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or breach of covenant by the Company.

acquisition," "business combination," "fair price" or other form of anti-
takeover law or regulation becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated
hereby, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective
Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such anti-takeover
Applicable Law inapplicable to the foregoing.



Section 6.06 Stock Exchange Delisting; Director Resignations.



(a)Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under Applicable Law and rules and policies of NYSE to enable the
delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the Shares from NYSE and the
deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time (if such delisting and deregistration will not have
already occurred at or prior to the Effective Time). 

(b)At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Parent of the resignation of the directors of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (other than directors of Subsidiaries whom Parent determines
shall continue to serve in such capacities following the Effective Time),
effective at the Effective Time.



Section 6.07 Director and Officer Liability.



(a)For six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain officers' and directors' liability insurance in respect of acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such Person
currently covered by the Company's officers' and directors' liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement
and from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current DandO Insurance carrier; provided, however, that in satisfying
its obligation under this Section 6.07(a), the Surviving Corporation shall not
be obligated to pay aggregate annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount
the Company paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this
Agreement (the "Current Premium") and, if such aggregate annual premiums for
such insurance would exceed 300% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the
Surviving Corporation's good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage
available for an aggregate premium equal to 300% of the Current Premium. The
provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the
Company from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current DandO Insurance carrier prior to the Effective Time or by the
Surviving Corporation at or after the Effective Time, which policies provide
each such Person currently covered by the Company's officers' and directors'
liability insurance policy with coverage and amount no less favorable than
those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement for an aggregate
period of six (6) years with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, provided, however, that the amount paid for
such prepaid policies shall not exceed 300% of the Current Premium without the
prior written consent of Parent. If such prepaid policies have been obtained
prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such
policies in full force and effect for their full term and continue to honor
the obligations thereunder. If requested by Parent, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent to obtain such tail or runoff policies as of the
Effective Time.



(b)From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall fulfill
and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
pursuant to (i) each indemnification agreement in effect as of the date of
this Agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective
Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of any of the Company's
Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party") and (ii) any indemnification
provision and any exculpation provision set forth in the certificate of
incorporation, as amended, or bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date
of this Agreement.



(c)The provisions of this Section 6.07 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under the articles of
organization or bylaws, by Contract or otherwise.



Section 6.08 Efforts.



(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things reasonably necessary under
Applicable Law to consummate the Merger, including (i) the obtaining of all
necessary actions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities,
the expiry or early termination of any applicable waiting periods, and the
making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with
Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of such reasonable steps as may
be reasonably necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an
action or Proceeding by, any Governmental Entities, (ii) the delivery of
required notices to, and the obtaining of required consents or waivers from,
Third Parties and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry
out the purposes of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company shall
not be permitted to pay, and Parent shall not be obligated to pay or permit or
agree to the Company paying, any material cash consideration to any Third
Party from whom consent or approval is required and the Company shall not
modify or enter into any Company Material Contract or Company Real Property
Lease or limit or dispose of any non-cash rights, assets or properties, and
Parent shall not be obligated to permit or agree to the Company's modification
or entrance into any Company Material Contract or Company Real Property Lease
or, on behalf of itself or any of its pre-Closing Affiliates, modify or enter
into any agreement or limit or dispose of any non-cash rights, assets or
properties, in each case pursuant to this Section 6.08(a) or any provision
that cross-references the proviso to this Section 6.08(a).



(b)In furtherance and not in limitation of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 6.08, each of Parent and the Company shall (i) promptly prepare and
file any notification and report forms and related material required under the
HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws, and any additional filings or
notifications and related material that are necessary, proper or advisable to
permit consummation of the Merger and (ii) provide or cause to be provided as
promptly as practicable any information and documentary material that may be
requested by the DOJ or FTC under the HSR Act.



(c)Subject to Applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, and the
sole right of Parent to make the final determination on behalf of the parties
on all strategy and tactics for obtaining clearances under the HSR Act and
other Antitrust Laws, the Company and Parent and their respective counsel
shall (i) provide each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review
and comment upon and consider in good faith the views of the other in
connection with all written communications (including any analyses,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating to proceedings under
the Antitrust Laws) with a Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) promptly inform each other of any
material communication (or other material correspondence or memoranda)
received from, or given to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) promptly furnish each other with
copies of all material correspondence, filings and written communications between them or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Entity or its respective staff, on the other hand,
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company and Parent
shall, to the extent practicable, provide the other party and its counsel with
advance notice of and the opportunity to participate in any material
discussion or meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing,
investigation or other inquiry in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary,
designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under
this Section 6.08(c) as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel and
previously-agreed outside economic consultants of the recipient and will not
be disclosed by such outside counsel or outside economic consultants to
employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written
consent of the party providing such materials.



(d)Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, Parent shall not be
required to, and the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, offer, propose, agree, or commit (i) to sell, divest, hold separate,
license, cause a Third Party to acquire, or otherwise dispose of (A) any of
the respective Affiliates of the Company or Parent or (B) any of the
respective operations, divisions, businesses, product lines, customers,
assets, properties or rights of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates (clauses (A) and (B) collectively, the "Divestiture Assets"), prior
to, contemporaneously with or after the Closing and regardless as to whether a
Third Party purchaser must be identified or approved prior to the Closing (a
"Divestiture"), (ii) to take any other actions that may limit Parent's, its
Affiliates', the Company's or its Affiliates' conduct in any way or any of the
foregoing's freedom of action with respect to, or ability to retain, one or
more of its operations, divisions, businesses, products lines, customers,
assets, properties or rights (a "Restraint") or (iii) to enter into any Order,
consent decree or other agreement to effectuate a Divestiture or Restraint,
except that, solely to the extent necessary to permit the consummation of the
Merger to occur before the End Date, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 7.01(c) by agreeing to and
implementing or committing to implement (1) sales, licenses or divestitures to
Third Parties (x) of Divestiture Assets that were used to generate, or
contributed to the generation of, annual gross revenues that do not exceed
$50,000,000 in the aggregate for all such sales, licenses and divestitures
(determined based on gross fiscal 2015 revenues) and (y) that do not require
Parent to convey any value to any Third Party other than the sales, licenses
or divestitures of such Divestiture Assets as specified in clause (x) and
reasonable and customary transition support or similar agreements of limited
duration relating to such sales, licenses or divestitures (provided that any
such transition support or similar agreement shall only be required to be
agreed to by Parent to the extent it reflects arm's-length and fair market
value terms as determined by Parent in good faith) and (2) Restraints that
would not have, and would not be reasonably expected to have, more than a de
minimis effect on Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries.



(e)Subject to the proviso to Section 6.08(a), the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all reasonable actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable to obtain the consents reasonably requested by Parent; provided that
the Company shall not take any action to solicit or obtain such consents
unless and until the Company or the Company's counsel is directed to do so by
Parent or Parent's counsel and then only upon the basis so requested.



Section 6.09 Financing.



(a)Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and to obtain, or cause to be obtained, the proceeds
of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment
Documents, including using reasonable best efforts to:



(i)maintain in effect the Commitment Documents (provided that the Commitment
Documents may be amended, supplemented, modified and replaced as set forth
below);



(ii)negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing (the "Definitive Agreements") consistent with the terms and
conditions contained in the Commitment Documents (including, as necessary, the "flex" provisions related
thereto) or, if available, on other terms that are not (x) materially less
favorable to Parent, in the aggregate, than the terms and conditions contained
in the Commitment Documents (including, as

necessary, the "flex" provisions related thereto) and (y) not prohibited by
clauses (i) - (iv) of Section 6.09(d); and



(iii)satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, obtain the waiver of) on a
timely basis all conditions in the Commitment Documents that are within
Parent's control (other than any condition where the failure to be so
satisfied is a direct result of the Company's failure to furnish information
to Parent or otherwise to comply with its obligations under this Agreement).



(b)In the event that all conditions contained in the Commitment Documents have
been satisfied (or upon funding will be satisfied) and Parent is obligated to
effect the Closing in accordance with Section 2.02, Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing Sources to fund the Debt
Financing on or prior to the Closing Date.



(c)Parent shall provide to the Company prompt notice (i) of any material
breach by any party of the Commitment Documents and/or the Definitive
Agreements of which Parent becomes aware, (ii) of any termination of the
Commitment Documents and/or the Definitive Agreements and (iii) of any
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the
Commitment Documents with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt Financing
or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at Closing of which Parent
becomes aware (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary course
negotiations with respect to the terms of the Debt Financing and/or the
Definitive Agreements). Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis in reasonable detail of all material developments concerning the
status of the Debt Financing, including its efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing and provide the Company at its request copies of all executed
Definitive Agreements for the Debt Financing.



(d)Parent shall not agree to or permit any termination, amendment,
replacement, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of its material
rights under, the Commitment Documents without the Company's prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) that (i) reduces the aggregate amount of cash proceeds available from the Debt Financing such that the aggregate funds that
would be available to Parent on the Closing Date would not be sufficient to
provide the funds required to be funded on the Closing Date to consummate the
Merger, (ii) that has conditions precedent to the funding on the Closing Date
that are, in the aggregate, more onerous than the conditions set forth in the
Commitment Documents, (iii) adversely impacts the ability of Parent to enforce
its rights under the Commitment Documents against the Financing Sources or
(iv) could otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or materially
delay the consummation of the Debt Financing or the Merger; provided that
Parent may, without the Company's prior written consent, amend, replace,
supplement or otherwise modify the Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead
arrangers, book runners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not
executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement so long as any
such addition would not reasonably be expected to prevent, impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Debt Financing or the Merger (it
being understood that any such amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification that provides for the assignment of a portion of the Debt
Financing commitments to any additional lenders, lead arrangers, book runners,
syndication agents or similar entities and the granting to such Persons of
approval rights as are customarily granted to additional agents or arrangers
shall be permitted hereunder and shall be deemed to not prevent, impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Debt Financing or the Merger). Upon
any such amendment, replacement, supplement or modification, the term
"Commitment Letter" shall mean the Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced,
supplemented or modified. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company true
and complete copies of any such amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification.



(e)Parent shall have the right to substitute the proceeds of other incurrences
of debt (including unsecured notes) for all or any portion of the Debt
Financing and reducing commitments under the Commitment Letter; provided, that
(u) to the extent any such debt has a scheduled special or mandatory
redemption right, such right is not exercisable prior to the earliest of the
consummation of the Merger on the Closing Date, the termination of this
Agreement or the End Date, (v) to the extent such offering or other incurrence
is not a substitution for the entire amount of the Debt Financing, such
offering or other incurrence of debt does not result in a breach or default
under, or violation of, the Commitment Documents, (w) to the extent such
offering or other incurrence is not a substitution for the entire amount of
the Debt Financing, the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing committed under
the Commitment Letter following such reduction, together with other cash and
cash equivalents available to Parent, is sufficient to provide the funds
required to be funded on the Closing Date to consummate the Merger, (x) the
proceeds of such debt offerings or other incurrences have been received by
Parent or a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent in cash, (y) Parent promptly
notifies the Company of such substitution and reduction and (z) true and
complete copies of each material amendment or modification to the Commitment
Documents relating thereto will be promptly provided to the Company. Further,
Parent shall have the right to substitute commitments in respect of other
financing for all or any portion of the Debt Financing from the same and/or
alternative bona fide third-party financing sources so long as (i) such
financing shall not reduce the aggregate amount of cash proceeds available
from the Debt Financing such that the aggregate funds that would be available
to Parent on the Closing Date would not be sufficient to provide the funds
required to be funded on the Closing Date to consummate the Merger, (ii) all
conditions precedent to effectiveness of definitive documentation for such
financing have been satisfied or such conditions precedent to the funding of
such financing are, in the aggregate, in respect of certainty of funding, substantially equivalent to (or more favorable to Parent than) the
conditions precedent set forth in Exhibit C of the Commitment Letter and (iii)
such financing would not impair, prevent or materially delay the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (any such financing under this clause (e) which
satisfies the requirements of this clause (e), the "Alternative Financing";
the definitive documentation for any such Alternative Financing, the
"Alternative Financing Documents"). True and complete copies of each
alternative financing commitment in respect of such Alternative Financing,
together with all related fee letters and associated engagement letters
(solely in the case of such fee letters, flex terms and engagement letters,
redacted for provisions related to fees and other economic terms on a basis
consistent with the redacted Fee Letter), will be promptly provided to the
Company. In the event any Alternative Financing is obtained, (i) any reference
herein to the term "Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any
commitment letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any Alternative
Financing, (ii) any reference herein to the term "Debt Financing" shall be
deemed to include such Alternative Financing, (iii) any reference herein to
the term "Fee Letter" shall be deemed to include any fee letter (or similar
agreement) with respect to any Alternative Financing and (iii) any reference
herein to the term "Financing Sources" shall be deemed to include any
financing sources or other lenders providing the Alternative Financing.



(f)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent's
obligations hereunder are not subject to Parent or any of its Affiliates
obtaining funds under the Debt Financing to consummate the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

forma financial statements or any related pro forma adjustments or, without
limitation of the cooperation required by ýSection 6.17(d), any conversion or

(x)using commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent in ensuring that the

(b)Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.10 to the contrary, in
fulfilling its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.10, (i) nothing in this

reasonable judgment of the Company after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, (x) result in the material contravention of, or could reasonably be
expected to result in a material violation or breach of, or a default under,
any Applicable Laws or under any Material Contract or (y) require the Company
to provide access to or disclose information that the Company determines would
result in a loss or waiver of attorney-client privilege of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (in each case it being agreed that the Company shall give notice
to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or documents
pursuant to this clause (E), and thereafter the Company and Parent shall
reasonably cooperate to cause such information to be provided in a manner that
would not reasonably be expected to violate the applicable restriction or
waive the applicable privilege or protection) or (F) require the Company to
prepare separate financial statements for any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii)
none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to execute
and deliver any Definitive Agreements or other agreements, pledge or security
documents, or other certificates or documents in connection with the Debt
Financing that are effective prior to the Effective Time (other than any
customary representation or authorization letters), (iii) none of the Board of
Directors (or equivalent bodies) of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
required to pass any resolution or take any similar actions approving the Debt

Parent shall, upon the request of the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including attorneys' fees)
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective pre-Closing directors, officers, employees
and Representatives from and against any and all losses or damages actually
suffered or incurred by them directly in connection with the arrangement of
any such Debt Financing and any cooperation or other actions taken pursuant to
this Section 6.10 (other than to the extent related to information,
cooperation or other actions provided by the Company, its Subsidiaries or
their respective pre-Closing directors, officers, employees or
Representatives), except in the event such loss or damage arises out of or
results from the gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or
intentional breach of its obligations hereunder by the Company, its
Subsidiaries or their respective pre-Closing directors, officers, employees or
Representatives.



Section 6.11 Company Indebtedness. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
obtain and deliver the Payoff Letter to Parent. The Company shall deliver (A)
a draft of the Payoff Letter to Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior
to the anticipated Closing Date and (B) an executed copy of the Payoff Letter
in substantially similar form at least one (1) Business Day prior to the
anticipated Closing Date.



Section 6.12 Company Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within one (1) Business Day in NY)
following its being formally notified of the same notify Parent in writing of,
and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense and
settlement of, any Company Stockholder Litigation. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, the Company shall not communicate with any opposing party in any
Company Stockholder Litigation regarding any settlement thereof without either
(a) consulting with Parent in advance of such communication, taking into
account in good faith Parent's views as to acceptable settlement terms and
promptly informing Parent of the contents of such communication or (b)
allowing Parent's counsel to participate in such communication. No full or
partial settlement of any Company Stockholder Litigation shall be agreed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written
consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).



Section 6.13 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or making any other public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such other
public statement without the consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except (i) as such release or
announcement that Parent or the Company determines, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, is required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement
with or rule of any securities exchange upon which the securities of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, are listed, in which case the party required
to make the release or announcement shall consult with the other party about,
and allow the other party reasonable time (taking into account the
circumstances) to comment on, such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance, and the party required to make the release or announcement will
consider such comments in good faith or (ii) in connection with a Change in
Recommendation (provided the Company shall have complied with Section 6.02 in
all but immaterial respects). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may make
public statements with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including their effect on Parent's business and its
financial projections, with investors, analysts and Financing Sources,
including, without limitation, on its periodic earnings calls and in any "road
show", so long as Parent's comments are not inconsistent with the press
releases previously issued and agreed upon by the parties.



Section 6.14 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all actions as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to
cause any dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including any
derivative securities with respect to any equity securities of the Company) by
each individual who is a director or officer of the Company, and who would
otherwise be subject to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, to be exempt under
Exchange Act Rule 16b-3.



Section 6.15 Employment Matters.



(a)For the one-year period following the Effective Time (or such shorter
period as the applicable Continuing Company Employee continues to be employed
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time) and subject
to Applicable Law, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to each Continuing Company Employee (i) at least the
same level of hourly salary or base wages and annual target bonus opportunity
as provided to such Continuing Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity-based
compensation) that, in the aggregate, are at least as favorable as the
employee benefits (excluding equity-based compensation) provided to such
Continuing Company Employee under the Company Benefit Plans as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the generality of the
foregoing, (i) with respect to the Continuing Company Employees' eligibility
to participate in a long term incentive plan maintained by Parent, Parent will
endeavor to use substantially similar criteria and processes in evaluating
such eligibility of Continuing Company Employees as Parent does in evaluating
the eligibility of employees of Parent, and (ii) for the one-year period
following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, to the Continuing Company Employees, severance benefits not less
favorable than the severance benefits provided by the Company pursuant to the
Company Benefit Plans and Made Available to Parent.



(b)Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries in which the
Continuing Company Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing
Date (collectively, the "Post-Closing Plans") to recognize the service of each
Continuing Company Employee with the Company prior to the Closing Date for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and, solely for purposes of any vacation and
severance benefits, levels of benefits under such Post-Closing Plans, in each
case, to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the
Effective Time under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Company Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to
the Effective Time; provided that such recognition of service shall not (i)
apply for purposes of any plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, (ii)
apply for purposes of benefit accruals or participation eligibility under any
defined benefit pension plan or plan providing post-retirement pension plan
benefits, (iii) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Continuing Company
Employee with respect to the same period of service, or (iv) apply for
purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (x) under which similarly
situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive credit for
prior service or (y) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to
level of benefits or participation. With respect to any Post-Closing Plan that
provides medical, dental or vision insurance benefits, for the plan year in
which such Continuing Company Employee is first eligible to participate,
Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to (A) cause any pre-existing
condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such plan to be
waived with respect to such Continuing Company Employee to the extent such
limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan
in which such Continuing Company Employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and (B) credit each Continuing Company Employee for an
amount equal to any medical, dental or vision expenses incurred by such
Continuing Company Employee in the year that includes the Closing Date (or, if
later, the year in which such Continuing Company Employee is first eligible to
participate in such Post-Closing Plan) for purposes of any applicable
deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such Post-
Closing Plan to the extent such expenses would have been credited under the
Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time, subject to the applicable information being
provided to Parent in a form that Parent reasonably determines is
administratively feasible to take into account under its plans. Such credited
expenses shall also count toward any annual or lifetime limits, treatment or
visit limits or similar limitations that apply under the terms of the
applicable plan.



(c)If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company Board (or the
appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as is necessary to terminate the Company's 401(k) plan (the "Company
401(k) Plan"), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. To the
extent the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated pursuant to Parent's request, the
Continuing Company Employees shall be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan
maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Closing Date. 

(d)The Company will provide Parent with a copy of any material written
communications intended for broad-based and general distribution to any
current or former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if such
communications relate to the compensation, employment or labor aspects of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and will provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such communications prior to
distribution.



(e)Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or
terminate the services of any Company Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit
Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or
any other benefit plan, program or Contract maintained or sponsored by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(including, after the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries) or
Affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date,
the Company and its Subsidiaries) or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate
any Company Benefit Plan or any other compensation or benefit or employment
plan, program or Contract after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Section 6.15
shall create any Third Party beneficiary rights in any Company Employee or
current or former service provider of the Company or its affiliates (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof).



Section 6.16 Proxy Statement; Company Stockholder Approval.



(a)As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and
in any event no later than March 24, 2016, the Company shall file with the SEC
a preliminary Proxy Statement. Parent shall, and shall direct its independent
accountants, counsel and other Representatives to, cooperate with the Company
in the preparation of the Proxy Statement, and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to furnish all information, data and documentation concerning Parent
and Merger Sub that is necessary or appropriate in connection with the
preparation of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall respond promptly to any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC on the Proxy Statement. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the preliminary Proxy
Statement to be cleared by the staff of the SEC and the Proxy Statement to be
filed in definitive form and be mailed to its stockholders in a timely manner
such that the Company Meeting is able to be validly held in accordance with
Applicable Law, the Company's certificate of incorporation and the Company's
bylaws as soon as reasonably practicable; provided, however, that the Company
may postpone the Company Meeting to a date no later than ten (10) Business
Days prior to the date of the Parent Meeting. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, or response to staff comments on, the Proxy Statement shall be
made by the Company without providing Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon and giving reasonable consideration
in good faith to such comments. If at any time prior to the Company Meeting
(or any adjournment or postponement thereof) any information relating to the
Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers, is discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement,
so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and the Company shall promptly file an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or
supplement to the stockholders of the Company. The Company shall notify Parent
promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC
and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on
the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, or the transactions
contemplated hereby.



(b)The Company shall take all actions necessary to duly call, establish a
record date for, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders, for the purpose of voting upon the adoption of this Agreement
(the "Company Meeting"), so that the Company Meeting occurs as soon as
reasonably practicable following the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed
to its stockholders, in accordance with Applicable Law, the Company's
certificate of incorporation and the Company's bylaws; provided, however, that
the Company may postpone the Company Meeting to a date no later than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the date of the Parent Meeting; provided, further, that
the Company may, in its reasonable discretion, further postpone or adjourn the
Company Meeting after reasonable consultation with Parent only (i) if, as of
the time for which the Company Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth
in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient Shares represented (either in
person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Company Meeting or to the extent that at such time the Company has not
received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the Requisite Company
Stockholder Approval at the Company Meeting (such postponement or adjournment
to be for no more than five (5) Business Days and shall be to no later than
the date three (3) Business Days prior to the End Date (such periods to be
calculated by reference to Business Days in NY)) or (ii) to allow time for the
filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure document
that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with
the Company's outside legal counsel) is necessary or required to be filed and
disseminated under Applicable Law, the Company's certificate of incorporation
or the Company's bylaws (such postponement or adjournment to be for no more
than a reasonable amount of time and shall be to no later than the date three
(3) Business Days in NY prior to the End Date). Once the Company has
established a record date for the Company Meeting, the Company shall not
change such record date or establish a different record date for the Company
Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, unless required to do so
by the DGCL. If the record date for the Company Meeting is changed, the
Company shall, as to that record date, comply with each of its obligations
under this Section 6.16. In connection with the Company Meeting, the Company
shall, (i) unless there has been a Change in Recommendation in accordance with
Section 6.02(c), use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requisite Company
Stockholder Approval and (ii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements
applicable to such meeting. The Company shall include in the Proxy Statement
the Company Recommendation, unless there has been a Change in Recommendation
in accordance with Section 6.02(c). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall submit this Agreement for the adoption by its
stockholders at the Company Meeting whether or not a Change in Recommendation shall have occurred
or an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise
made known to the Company, the Company Board or the Company's Representatives
or its stockholders.



Section 6.17 Parent Shareholder Circular; Parent Shareholder Approval.



(a)As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Parent shall prepare and submit for approval to the HKSE the Parent
Shareholder Circular. The Company shall, and shall direct its independent
accountants, counsel and other Representatives to, cooperate with Parent in
the preparation of the Parent Shareholder Circular, and use its commercially
reasonable efforts, subject to Section 9.04(b), to furnish all information,
data and documentation concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is
necessary or appropriate in connection with the preparation of the Parent
Shareholder Circular. Parent shall respond promptly to any comments from the
HKSE or the staff of the HKSE on the Parent Shareholder Circular. Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Shareholder Circular to be
filed with the HKSE and to be disseminated to its shareholders, in each case,
as and to the extent required by the Listing Rules and any other Applicable
Law, as soon as reasonably practicable. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, or response to staff comments on, the Parent Shareholder
Circular shall be made by Parent without providing the Company and its counsel
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon and giving reasonable
consideration in good faith to such comments. If at any time prior to the
Parent Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, is discovered by the Company or Parent which is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Parent
Shareholder Circular, so that the Parent Shareholder Circular would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
Parent shall promptly file an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information with the HKSE and, to the extent required by the Listing
Rules or Applicable Law, disseminate such amendment or supplement to the
shareholders of Parent. Parent shall notify the Company promptly of the
receipt of any comments from the HKSE or the staff of the HKSE and of any
request by the HKSE or the staff of the HKSE for amendments or supplements to
the Parent Shareholder Circular or for additional information and shall supply
the Company with copies of all correspondence between Parent or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the HKSE or the staff of the HKSE, on
the other hand, with respect to Parent Shareholder Circular, or the
transactions contemplated hereby.



(b)Parent shall take all actions necessary to duly call, establish a record
date for, give notice of, convene and hold an ordinary general meeting of its
shareholders, for the purpose of approving this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger (the "Parent Meeting"), so that the
Parent Meeting occurs as soon as reasonably practicable following the date on
which the HKSE grants clearance with respect to the Parent Shareholder
Circular, in accordance with Applicable Law, the Listing Rules, and Parent's
articles of incorporation; provided, that Parent may, in its reasonable
discretion, postpone or adjourn the Parent Meeting after reasonable
consultation with the Company only (i) if, as of the time for which the Parent
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the applicable notice), there
are insufficient shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Parent Meeting or to the extent that
at such time Parent has not received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt
of the Requisite Parent Shareholder Approval at the Parent Meeting (such
postponement or adjournment to be for no more than five (5) Business Days and
shall be to no later than the date three (3) Business Days prior to the End
Date (such periods to be calculated by reference to Business Days in Hong
Kong)) or (ii) to allow time for the filing and dissemination of any
supplemental or amended disclosure document that the Parent Board has
determined in good faith (after consultation with Parent's outside legal
counsel) is necessary or required to be filed and disseminated under
Applicable Law, the Listing Rules or Parent's articles of incorporation (such
postponement or adjournment to be for no more than a reasonable amount of time
and shall be to no later than the date three (3) Business Days in Hong Kong
prior to the End Date).



(c)In connection with the Parent Meeting, the directors of Parent shall
include the Parent Recommendation in the Parent Shareholder Circular;
provided, that nothing in this Section 6.17(c) shall limit such directors'
right to withdraw, amend, qualify or modify the Parent Recommendation in the
Parent Shareholder Circular based on such directors' finding in good faith
(after consultation with external legal counsel) that the failure to do so
would constitute a breach of their fiduciary duties under Applicable Law (any
withdrawal of the Parent Recommendation or amendment, qualification or
modification of the Parent Recommendation in a manner adverse to the Company,
a "Parent Recommendation Change"). Parent shall promptly notify the Company in
writing of any determination to make a Parent Recommendation Change.



(d)The Company shall, and shall cause its respective Company Employees and
Representatives, to use reasonable best efforts to provide to Parent all
cooperation that is reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
preparation of the Parent Shareholder Circular, including (i) participating in
a reasonable number of meetings, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions and
sessions with Parent's Representatives in connection with the preparation of
the Parent Shareholder Circular, (ii) delivering to Parent the financial
statements, data and documentation of the Company required to be included in,
or used in the preparation of, the Parent Shareholder Circular and (iii) using
reasonable best efforts to cause its current and former independent
accountants to cooperate with Parent's independent accountants in preparation
of (or, at Parent's request, to lead in the preparation of) the pro forma
financial statements and reconciled financial statements, and whatever comfort
letters, are required to be included in, or used in preparation of, the Parent
Shareholder Circular.

be true and correct (A) would give rise to the failure of one of the
conditions set forth in Section 7.02(a) or Section 7.02(b) to be satisfied and
(B) is incapable of being cured or has not been cured by the Company within
thirty (30) calendar days after written notice has been given by Parent to the
Company of such breach, failure to perform or failure to be true and correct
(or, if earlier, by the End Date); provided, however, that Parent may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(c)(ii) if, at the time

concurrently with such termination pays to Parent by wire transfer in
immediately available funds the Company Termination Fee required to be paid
pursuant to Section 8.03(a)(ii) and (B) concurrently with such termination,
enters into such definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement; or



(ii)Parent shall have breached or failed to perform in any material respect
any of its covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement or any
representation or warranty of Parent contained in this Agreement shall not be
true and correct, which breach, failure to perform or failure to be true and
correct (A) would give rise to the failure of one of the conditions set forth
in Section 7.03(a) or Section 7.03(b) to be satisfied, and (B) is incapable of
being cured or has not been cured by Parent within thirty (30) calendar days
after written notice has been given by the Company to Parent of such breach,
failure to perform or failure to be true and correct (or, if earlier, by the
End Date); provided, however, that the Company may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(d)(ii) if, at the time such
termination would otherwise take effect in accordance with the foregoing, the
Company is in material breach of this Agreement; or



(iii)prior to the receipt of the Requisite Parent Shareholder Approval, if (A)
the Parent Board (or any committee thereof) shall have failed to include the
Parent Recommendation in the Parent Shareholder Circular or shall have
otherwise effected a Parent Recommendation Change or (B) Parent shall have
violated or breached Section 6.17 in a manner that has a material adverse
impact on the timing of, or the ability to obtain, the Requisite Parent
Stockholder Approval;

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01

to each other party hereto and specify the applicable provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such
termination is effected and the basis for such termination.

Section 8.02 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 8.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect without
liability of any party, any Representative of such party or any Parent Related

this Section 8.02, Section 8.03 and Article 9 shall survive any termination
hereof pursuant to Section 8.01; provided, further, that nothing herein shall
relieve the Company from any liability for any fraud or Willful Breach of this
Agreement prior to such termination.



Section 8.03 Company Termination Payments.



(a)If, but only if, this Agreement is terminated by:



(i)Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(ii) or either Parent or the Company
pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) or 8.01(b)(ii), and in any such case (x) prior
to the date of such termination (or the date of the Company Meeting in the
case of termination pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(ii)), an Acquisition Proposal
or an intention to make an Acquisition Proposal shall have been communicated
to the management of the Company or the Company Board or shall have been
publicly disclosed and (y) within fifteen (15) months after such termination,
(1) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (provided, that for purposes of this Section 8.03(a)(i),
the references to "fifteen percent (15%)" in the definition of Acquisition
Transaction shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)") with a
Third Party that is thereafter consummated or (2) the Company consummates the
transactions contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal with a Third Party,
which, in the case of (1) or (2), need not be the same Acquisition Proposal
described in clause (x) above;



(ii)the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(i);



(iii)Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(i) (but only in circumstances where
Parent does not have a right to terminate pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(ii)); or



(iv)either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(ii);

then, in the case of Sections 8.03(a)(i), (ii) or (iii), the Company shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent or Parent's designee(s), as the case may
be, an amount in cash equal to $54,700,000, or, in the case of Section
8.03(a)(iv), an amount in cash equal to $13,700,000 (such applicable amount,
the "Company Termination Fee"); provided, however, that any payment of the
Company Termination Fee payable in accordance with Section 8.03(a)(iv) shall
not affect Parent's or Parent's designee(s)', as the case may be, right to
receive any Company Termination Fee otherwise due under Section 8.03(a)(i),
but shall reduce, on a dollar for dollar basis, any Company Termination Fee
that subsequently becomes due and payable under Section 8.03(a)(i).

(b)Any payments required to be made under Section 8.03(a) shall be made by
wire transfer of same day funds to the account or accounts designated by
Parent, (w) in the case of Section 8.03(a)(i), on the same day as the
consummation of any transactions contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal or the entry into a definitive agreement with respect to
an Acquisition Proposal, (x) in the case of Section 8.03(a)(ii), immediately
prior to or concurrently with such termination, and (y) in the case of Section
8.03(a)(iii) or Section 8.03(a)(iv), promptly, but in no event later than two
(2) Business Days (such period to be calculated by reference to Business Days
in NY) after the date of such termination.



(c)For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the final proviso in Section
8.03(a), any payment made by the Company under this Section 8.03 shall be
payable only once with respect to this Section 8.03 and not in duplication
even though such payment may be payable under one or more provisions hereof.



(d)Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.03 are an integral part of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and that without such agreements the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly,
if the Company fails to pay the Company Termination Fee due pursuant to this
Section 8.03 or any portion thereof and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit which results in an Order against the
Company for such amounts or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay to
Parent or Merger Sub their costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's
fees and disbursements) in connection with such suit, together with interest
on the amount of the Company Termination Fee (or any portion thereof that has
not been paid timely in accordance with this Agreement) and on the amount of
such costs and expenses, in each case from and including the date payment of
such amount was due to through the date of actual payment at the prime rate
set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made.



Section 8.04 Parent Termination Payment.



(a) If, but only if, this Agreement is terminated by:



(i)either the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(iii); or



(ii)the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(iii) (but only in circumstances
where the Company does not have a right to terminate pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(iii)),

then Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company or the Company's
designee(s), as the case may be, an amount in cash equal to, in the case of
Section 8.04(a)(i), $13,700,000, or, in the case of Section 8.04(a)(ii),
$18,200,000 (such applicable amount, the "Parent Termination Fee").

(b)Any payments required to be made under Section 8.04(a) shall be made by
wire transfer of same day funds to the account or accounts designated by the
Company promptly, and in no event later than two (2) Business Days (such
period to be calculated by reference to Business Days in Hong Kong) after the
date of such termination.



(c)For the avoidance of doubt, any payment made by Parent under this Section
8.04 shall be payable only once with respect to this Section 8.04 and not in
duplication even though such payment may be payable under one or more
provisions hereof. 

(d)Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.04 are an integral part of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and that without such agreements the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly,
if Parent fails to pay the Parent Termination Fee due pursuant to this Section
8.04 or any portion thereof and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company
commences a suit which results in an Order against Parent or Merger Sub for
such amounts or any portion thereof, Parent shall pay to the Company its costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Parent
Termination Fee (or any portion thereof that has not been paid timely in
accordance with this Agreement) and on the amount of such costs and expenses,
in each case from and including the date payment of such amount was due to
through the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall
Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

Section 9.03 Amendments, Modification and Waivers.



(a)Any provision of this Agreement may be amended, modified or waived at any
time before or after approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the Boards
of Directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub if, but only if, such
amendment, modification or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of
an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by
each party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided, however, that
following the receipt of the Requisite Company Stockholder Approval, no such

approval of the stockholders of the Company under the DGCL unless the required

waiver shall be made or given that requires the approval of the shareholders

Agreement to which the Financing Sources are intended third party
beneficiaries pursuant to Section 9.05 that is materially adverse to any
Financing Source shall be effective without the written consent of such
Financing Source.



(b)Any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement or condition herein may be waived at any time prior to the Effective
Time by any of the parties entitled to the benefit thereof only by a written
instrument signed by each such party granting such waiver. No failure or delay
by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege. Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights and
remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by Applicable Law.



Section 9.04 Costs; Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs

party incurring such cost or expense, except that (a) any filing fees paid to
Governmental Entities in connection with filings made pursuant to Antitrust

and documented, out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by the Company in
connection with any conversion or reconciliation of the Company Financial

Section 9.05 Assignment; Benefit. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any
of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Applicable Law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other parties and any purported
assignment in violation of this Section 9.05 shall be null and void; provided
that Parent or Merger Sub, upon prior written notice to the Company, may
assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or
Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other than the
parties hereto or their respective successors, and permitted assigns any
rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this

the benefit of the Persons or entities benefiting therefrom who are expressly
intended to be third-party beneficiaries thereof and who may enforce the
covenants contained therein, (ii) the provisions of this Section 9.05 and
Sections ý9.03, ý9.06, 9.07(b), 9.08, ý9.09 and 9.15, which shall inure to the

party beneficiary rights under this Section 9.05 or any other provision of
this Agreement.



Section 9.06 Governing Law. This Agreement and any Proceedings arising out of
or related hereto or to the Merger or to the inducement of any party hereto to
enter into this Agreement (whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or
otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or otherwise) shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Applicable Law of the State of Delaware, including all matters of
construction, validity and performance, without regard to the conflicts of law
rules of such State that would refer a matter to the laws of another
jurisdiction.



Section 9.07 Jurisdiction.



(a)The parties hereto agree that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware and
any state appellate court therefrom located in Wilmington, Delaware, or, if no
such state court has proper jurisdiction, the Federal District Court for the
District of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware, and any appellate court
therefrom. Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of such court in respect of any legal or equitable Proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or
relating to enforcement of any of the terms of this Agreement, and hereby
waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such Proceeding, any
claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court,
that the Proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
Proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party agrees that notice
or the service of process in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be properly served or
delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by Section 9.01 or in any
other manner permitted by Applicable Law.



(b)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party hereto further
agrees that New York State or United States Federal courts sitting in the

transactions contemplated hereby, and that no party hereto will bring or
support, or permit any of their Affiliates to bring, any such action in any
other court.



Section 9.08 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR IN ANY ACTION RELATING TO THE DEBT FINANCING OR INVOLVING A

Section 9.09 Specific Performance; Remedies. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this

otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware located in
Wilmington, Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom located in
Wilmington, Delaware, or, if no such state court has proper jurisdiction, the
Federal District Court located in Wilmington, Delaware, and any appellate
court therefrom, and, in any action for specific performance, each party waives the defense of adequacy of
a remedy at law and waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity (subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement).



Section 9.10 Severability. Other than with respect to Section 8.03 and Section
8.04, which are integral parts of this Agreement, if any term, provision,
covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be invalid, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner, in order that the Merger be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.



Section 9.11 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement,
the exhibits to this Agreement, the Schedules, the Company Disclosure
Schedules and the Parent Disclosure Schedules and any documents delivered by

among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect thereto.



Section 9.12 Rules of Construction. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
that it has been represented by counsel of its choice throughout all
negotiations that have preceded the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
and that it has executed the same with the advice of said independent counsel.
Each party hereto and its counsel cooperated and participated in the drafting
and preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and
any and all drafts relating thereto exchanged among the parties shall be
deemed the work product of all of the parties and may not be construed against
any party hereto by reason of its drafting or preparation. Accordingly, any
rule of law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any
ambiguities in this Agreement against any party that drafted or prepared it is
of no application and is hereby expressly waived by each of the parties
hereto, and any controversy over interpretations of this Agreement shall be
decided without regard to events of drafting or preparation.



Section 9.13 Headings. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this Agreement
are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive or
interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this Agreement is for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.



Section 9.14 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party hereto has received a counterpart hereof signed by each
other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall
have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication). Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by
facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in PDF form, or by any other

obligations or Liabilities to any party hereto under this Agreement or for any
claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

in this Agreement and without limiting the generality of Section 9.15(a), no
Parent Related Party shall have any Liability to the Company or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives, or any holder of Shares, or any Person claiming
