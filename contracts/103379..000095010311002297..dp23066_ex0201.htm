AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 12, 2011 (this "Agreement"),
among V.F. Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation ("Parent"), VF Enterprises,
Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and The Timberland Company, a Delaware corporation
(the "Company").

  

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has (i)
determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and the
stockholders of the Company, and declared it advisable, to enter into this
Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub providing for the merger (the "Merger")
of Merger Sub with and into the Company in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, (ii) approved this Agreement in
accordance with the DGCL, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, and (iii) resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement by
the stockholders of the Company;

  

  

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have each approved,
and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has declared it advisable for Merger
Sub to enter into, this Agreement providing for the Merger in accordance with
the DGCL, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

  

  

WHEREAS, as an inducement and condition to Parent's willingness to enter into
this Agreement, members of the Swartz Family Group holding approximately 73.5%
of the combined voting power of the Shares outstanding as of the date hereof
are entering into a voting agreement with Parent simultaneously with the
execution of this Agreement (the "Voting Agreement"), whereby, among other
things, such persons have agreed to execute and deliver, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein, an irrevocable written consent in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement, which consent when executed and
delivered will be sufficient to adopt this Agreement and to approve the Merger
without any further action by any other stockholder of the Company.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I.

  

  

THE MERGER

  

  

SECTION 1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time (as defined
below), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of
the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation").

  

  

SECTION 1.2. Closing; Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of Article
VII, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices
of Ropes and Gray LLP, Prudential Tower, 800 Boylston Street, Boston,
Massachusetts 02199, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the
third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

1  

  

 

 

 

  

  

VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by applicable law) waiver of those conditions), or at such
other place or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually
agree; provided, however, that notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in Article VII, if the date that would otherwise be
the Closing Date (the "Condition Date") would occur during the last 15 days of
any fiscal quarter of Parent, except to the extent the provisions of this
proviso are waived in writing by Parent, Parent shall not be required to
effect the Closing until the first business day of Parent's immediately
succeeding fiscal quarter on which, subject to the immediately succeeding
proviso, the conditions set forth in Article VII are satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by applicable law) waiver of those conditions); provided,
further, that if the Closing is delayed due to the application of the
preceding proviso, the parties agree that the conditions set forth in Section
7.2(a) and Section 7.2(c) (as it relates to the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2(a)) shall be deemed satisfied if the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2(a) would have been satisfied as of the Condition Date in the
absence of the preceding proviso, and Parent receives the certificate
contemplated by Section 7.2(c) (as it relates to the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2(a)) to the foregoing effect as of the Condition Date. The date on
which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter referred to as the "Closing
Date". If Parent desires to delay the Closing due to the application of the
first proviso of this Section 1.2, Parent shall deliver to the Company a
written notice to that effect (stating its good faith determination of the
Condition Date) on or prior to the date specified as the Condition Date in
such notice; it being understood that following the delivery of such notice,
Parent shall not thereafter be entitled to assert the failure of the Company
to, prior to the date of such notice, comply with any covenant or agreement to
be performed by the Company hereunder that was known to Parent prior to the
delivery of such notice as the basis for the condition set forth in Sections
7.2(b) not being satisfied or as the basis for terminating the Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(e). At the Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "Certificate
of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form
as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
the DGCL (the date and time of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as is
specified in the Certificate of Merger and as is agreed to by the Company and
Parent, being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time") and shall make
all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL in connection with the
Merger.

  

  

SECTION 1.3. Effects of the Merger. From and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at
the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

SECTION 1.4. Certificate of Incorporation; By-Laws.

  

  

(a) At the Effective Time and by virtue of the Merger, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated to be identical to
the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except (i) for Article FIRST, which shall read "The
name of the corporation is The Timberland Company" and (ii) that the
provisions of the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub relating to the
incorporator of Merger Sub shall be omitted, and as so amended shall be the
amended and restated certificate of

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with its terms and provided by applicable law.

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, the by-laws of the Company shall be amended to read
in their entirety as the by-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and as so amended shall be the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms, the
amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
and as provided by applicable law.

  

  

SECTION 1.5. Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time (i) the
directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of the Company at the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal.

(a) Except as set forth in Section 2.1(b), each share of Class A Common Stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Class A Common Stock") and
Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Class B
Common Stock" and, together with the Class A Common Stock, the "Company Common
Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than any Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.3(a)) shall be converted
into the right to receive $43.00 in cash (the "Merger Consideration") payable
to the holder thereof, without interest, upon surrender of such Shares in the
manner provided in Section 2.4, less any required withholding Taxes;

  

  

(b) (i) Each share of Class A Common Stock (collectively, "Class A Shares")
and each share of Class B Common Stock (collectively, "Class B Shares" and,
together with the Class A Shares, the "Shares") held in the treasury of the
Company and each Share owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and retired without any
conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto and (ii) each Share held by any direct or indirect subsidiary of the
Company or Parent (other than Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation such that each such subsidiary owns the same percentage
of the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time as such subsidiary owned in Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

  

  

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

shall (except for any such shares resulting from the conversion of Shares
pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 2.1(b)) constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

SECTION 2.2. Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Stock; Company
Restricted Units; Company ESPP.

  

  

(a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each option to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (an
"Option") that is outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, shall be canceled, with the holder of each such
Option becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash (the "Option
Consideration") equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares previously
subject to such Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per Share previously subject to such Option, less any
required withholding Taxes.

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, each Share granted subject to vesting or other
restrictions pursuant to any Company Stock Plan or pursuant to any Contract
(collectively, "Restricted Shares") which is then outstanding shall vest and
become free of such restrictions and, at the Effective Time, the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to
each such Restricted Share, less any required withholding Taxes (including any
withholding Taxes required in respect of the vesting of such Restricted
Shares) (the "Restricted Share Consideration").

  

  

(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit and performance stock
unit granted subject to vesting or other restrictions pursuant to any Company
Stock Plan or pursuant to any Contract (collectively, "Restricted Units")
which is then outstanding shall vest and become free of such restrictions and,
at the Effective Time, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive an
amount in cash (the "Restricted Unit Consideration") equal to the product of
(A) the number of Shares previously subject to such restricted stock unit or
performance stock unit and (B) the Merger Consideration, less any required
withholding Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of applying the
immediately preceding sentence to any Restricted Unit that is a performance
stock unit, the number of Shares treated as previously subject to such
Restricted Unit shall be equal to the number of Shares which the holder would
have been eligible to receive had performance criteria applicable to such
Restricted Unit been achieved at target levels (and which number of Shares is
set forth, for the avoidance of doubt, on the Equity Awards Schedule under the
"PUs Outstanding" column with respect to the applicable Restricted Unit).

  

  

(d) The foregoing provisions of this Section 2.2 shall not apply to the
Company's 1991 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or any other plan, program or
arrangement intending to qualify as a stock purchase plan under Section 423 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") (the "Company
ESPP"). With respect to the Company ESPP, the Company shall as soon as
practicable take all actions necessary to provide that (i) participants may
not increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections prospectively;
(ii) no purchase period or offering period shall commence under the Company
ESPP following the date of this Agreement; (iii) each participant's
outstanding right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the Company
ESPP shall be suspended immediately following the end of the purchase or
offering period in effect on the date of this Agreement or, if earlier, the
end of the Business Day immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that
each participant's accumulated payroll deductions as of the Effective Time
shall be used to purchase shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, and the
shares of Company Common Stock

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

purchased thereunder shall be canceled at the Effective Time and converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(a);
and (iv) as promptly as reasonably practicable following the purchase of
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the preceding clause (iii),
the funds, if any, that remain in a participant's accounts after such purchase
shall be returned to the participant. The Company shall cause the Company ESPP
to terminate at the Effective Time, and no further purchase rights shall be
granted or exercised under the Company ESPP thereafter.

  

  

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such actions as it may deem necessary or appropriate to
effect the treatment of Options, Restricted Shares and Restricted Units
contemplated by Section 2.2(a), Section 2.2(b) and Section 2.2(c). The Company
shall provide Parent with drafts of such resolutions prior to their execution.

  

  

SECTION 2.3. Dissenting Shares.

  

  

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that
are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which
are held by holders of Shares who have not voted in favor of or consented to
the Merger and who have properly demanded and perfected their rights to be
paid the fair value of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to only such
rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; provided, however, that if
any such holder shall fail to perfect or shall effectively waive, withdraw or
lose such holder's rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such holder's shares
of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at
the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
therefor, as set forth in Section 2.1 of this Agreement, without any interest
thereon.

  

  

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any appraisal demands
received by the Company, withdrawals thereof and any other instruments served
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the
exercise of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed) or as otherwise required by applicable
law, make any payment with respect to any such exercise of appraisal rights,
offer to settle or settle any such rights or approve any withdrawal of any
such demands.

  

  

SECTION 2.4. Surrender of Shares; Payment Procedures.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent for the stockholders of the
Company in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent") and to receive the
Merger Consideration to which the stockholders of the Company shall become
entitled pursuant to this Article II. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent sufficient funds to
make all payments pursuant to Sections 2.4(c). Such funds may be invested by
the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; provided that no such investment or
losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of
Company Common Stock, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of
the Company in the amount of any such losses and such investments shall be in
(A) obligations of the United States

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

of America or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America, (B) certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank which are then publicly available), (C) commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively or (D) money market funds
substantially all the assets of which are comprised of investments in the
obligations described in clauses (A) through (C). Any interest or income
produced by, or profit resulting from, such investments will be payable to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs.

  

  

(b) Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be deposited
with the Surviving Corporation sufficient funds to make all payments pursuant
to Section 2.4(d).

  

  

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event within five business
days following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of (i) an outstanding
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented Shares (the "Certificates") or (ii) Shares represented by book-
entry ("Book-Entry Shares"), a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be
in such form and have provisions reasonably acceptable to the Company and
Parent and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the
case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such Shares for payment of the
Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a
Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and such
Certificate or book-entry shall then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other
than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer or be accompanied by all documents
required to evidence transfer and that the person requesting such payment
shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment
of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of
the Certificate or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been
paid or is not applicable. Any other transfer Taxes payable as a result of the
consummation of the Merger will be paid by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.4(c), each
Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
applicable Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II. For the
avoidance of doubt, no payment shall be made under this Section 2.4(c) in
respect of any Share that was a Restricted Share vesting at or prior to the
Effective Time as to which withholding Taxes have not been withheld; payment
for any such Share shall instead be provided pursuant to Section 2.4(d).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) All payments with respect to canceled Options, Restricted Units and
Restricted Shares, shall be made by the Surviving Corporation as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time from funds deposited by or at
the direction of Parent pursuant to Section 2.4(b). No interest shall be paid
or accrued for the benefit of holders of Options on the Option Consideration
payable in respect of the Options, to holders of Restricted Units on the
Restricted Unit Consideration payable in respect of the Restricted Units, or
to the holders of Restricted Shares on the Restricted Share Consideration in
respect of the Restricted Shares. For purposes of this Section 2.4(d) and
Section 2.4(e), the term "Restricted Share" shall include any Share that was
previously a Restricted Share and that vested at or prior to the Effective
Time but as to which required withholding Taxes had not been withheld at or
prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(e) At any time following the date that is twelve months after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not
been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and, after such
funds have been delivered to the Surviving Corporation, such holders shall be
entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. The holders of Options, Restricted Units
and Restricted Shares shall be entitled to look to Parent and Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws) as
general creditors thereof with respect to the Option Consideration payable
with respect to their canceled Options, with respect to the Restricted Unit
Consideration payable with respect to their cancelled Restricted Units, and
with respect to the Restricted Share Consideration payable with respect to
their cancelled Restricted Shares. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with
the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration and the payment of Option
Consideration, Restricted Unit Consideration, and Restricted Share
Consideration. Neither the Surviving Corporation, Parent nor the Paying Agent
will be liable to any person entitled to payment under this Article II for any
consideration which is properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  

  

(f) At the Effective Time the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective
Time, all Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in, this Article
II.

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of
Shares, Options or Restricted Units pursuant to this Agreement any amount as
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent determines may be
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts are so properly
withheld by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case
may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares, Options or
Restricted Units, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case may be.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the holder's compliance with the replacement requirements
established by the Paying Agent, and, if required by the Surviving
Corporation, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect
of the Shares represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Article II.

  

  

SECTION 2.5. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares shall
occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split or combination, exchange or readjustment of Shares, or stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such period, but excluding any change that
results from any exercise of Options or settlement of Restricted Units, in
each case outstanding as of the date hereof and granted under any Company
Stock Plan or pursuant to any Contract, with such exercise or settlement in
accordance with the terms of such Option or Restricted Unit as of the date
hereof, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement (including any Option Consideration and any Restricted Unit
Consideration) shall be appropriately adjusted.

  

  

ARTICLE III.

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  

  

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that,
except as set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the
Company to Parent and Merger Sub prior to the execution of this Agreement (the
"Company Disclosure Schedule") (it being understood that any information set
forth in one section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to apply to each other section or subsection of this Agreement to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent that such information is relevant to
such other section or subsection) and except as disclosed in any Company SEC
Report (as defined below) filed on or after December 31, 2010 and prior to the
date of this Agreement (but subject to Section 9.13):

  

  

SECTION 3.1. Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries. The Company and
each of its subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good
standing) under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has all
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
except where any such failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing
or to have such power or authority would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined below). The Company and each of its subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where
the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature
of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than
in such jurisdictions where any such failure to be so qualified or licensed or
in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. "Material Adverse Effect" means
any change, effect, event, circumstance, occurrence or state of facts that is
materially adverse to (a) the business, financial condition, results of
operations, assets or liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as
a whole or (b) the Company's ability to consummate the Merger; provided,
however, that, in the case of the immediately preceding clause (a), none of
the following, or any changes, effects, events,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

circumstances, occurrence or state of facts relating to or resulting
therefrom, shall be deemed in themselves, either alone or in combination, to
constitute, and none of them shall be taken into account in determining
whether there has been or could or would be, a Material Adverse Effect: (i)
economic, financial market, or geopolitical conditions in general, (ii)
general changes or developments in the industries in which the Company and its
subsidiaries operate, (iii) the announcement of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) changes in Tax laws or regulations or
applicable accounting regulations or principles or interpretations thereof,
(v) changes in the market price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock
(but the reasons or causes of such changes may constitute a Material Adverse
Effect and may be taken into account in determining whether there has been or
could or would be a Material Adverse Effect), (vi) the failure, in and of
itself, by the Company to meet any expected or projected financial or
operating performance target, as well as any change by the Company in any
expected or projected financial or operating performance target (but the
reasons or causes of such failures or changes may constitute a Material
Adverse Effect and may be taken into account in determining whether there has
been or could or would be a Material Adverse Effect), (vii) acts of God,
national or international hostilities, war (whether or not declared) or
terrorism, or (viii) any litigation brought or threatened by the stockholders
of the Company or any of its non-wholly-owned subsidiaries (whether on behalf
of the Company or such subsidiaries or otherwise) arising out of or in
connection with the existence, announcement or performance of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, so long as, in the case of clauses
(i), (ii), (iv) and (vii), the effect on the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, is not disproportionate to that on other companies in the
industry in which the Company operates.

  

  

SECTION 3.2. Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws. The Company has
heretofore furnished or otherwise made available to Parent a complete and
correct copy of the restated certificate of incorporation, as amended (the
"Certificate of Incorporation"), and the by-laws (the "By-Laws") of the
Company, each as currently in effect. The Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company and the By-Laws are in full force and effect and no other
organizational documents are applicable to or binding upon the Company. The
Company is not in violation of any provisions of its Certificate of
Incorporation or By-Laws in any material respect.

  

  

SECTION 3.3. Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of (i) 120,000,000 Class A Shares, (ii) 20,000,000 Class B Shares and
(iii) 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
"Preferred Stock"). As of June 10, 2011 (the "Capitalization Date"), (i)
40,146,141 shares of Class A Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of
which were validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and were issued free
of preemptive rights, (ii) 10,568,389 shares of Class B Common Stock were
issued and outstanding, all of which were validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and were issued free of preemptive rights, (iii) an aggregate of
5,676,264 Class A Shares were reserved for issuance upon or otherwise
deliverable in connection with the grant of equity-based awards, the exercise
of outstanding Options or the settlement of outstanding Restricted Units
issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the Company ESPP, (iv)
36,845,237 shares of Class A Common Stock were issued and held in treasury,
(v) no shares of Class B Common Stock were issued and held in treasury and
(vi) no shares of Preferred Stock were outstanding. On June 11, 2011 at 9:12
p.m., Boston time, the Company's counsel provided to Parent's counsel a list
(the "Equity Awards Schedule") of (x) all Options issued as of the
Capitalization Date, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
thereto, the expiration date and the exercise price thereof and (y) all
Restricted Units issued as of the Capitalization Date, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject thereto. From the Capitalization Date, no shares
of Company Common Stock or Preferred Stock have been issued,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

except for Shares issued (x) upon the exercise of Options or in connection
with other equity-based awards outstanding as of the Capitalization Date, in
each case, in accordance with their terms or (y) pursuant to the Company ESPP
as in effect on the date of this Agreement and in accordance with Section
2.2(d). Except as set forth above: (A) there are not outstanding or authorized
any (I) shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company,
(II) securities of the Company convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
capital stock or voting securities of the Company or (III) options or other
rights to acquire from the Company, and no obligation of the Company to issue,
any capital stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for capital stock or voting securities of the Company
(collectively, "Company Securities"), (B) there are no outstanding obligations
of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company
Securities and (C) there are no other options, calls, warrants or other
rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character relating to
the issued or unissued capital stock of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party. None of the
Company Securities are owned by any of the Company's subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) Where such concepts are legally applicable, each of the outstanding shares
of capital stock of each of the Company's subsidiaries is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. All shares of capital stock in
any of the Company's subsidiaries are owned by the Company or another wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company and are owned free and clear of all Liens
other than Permitted Liens. (A) There are not authorized or outstanding any
(i) securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock of or other voting securities or
ownership interests in any subsidiary of the Company or (ii) options or other
rights to acquire from the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or other
obligation of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to issue, any capital
stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
any capital stock or other voting securities of any subsidiary of the Company
(the items in clauses (i) and (ii) being referred to collectively as the
"Company Subsidiary Securities") and (B) there are no outstanding obligations
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any of the Company Subsidiary Securities.

  

  

SECTION 3.4. Authority. (a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, subject, in
the case of the Merger, to receipt of the Stockholder Approval (as defined
below). Assuming the accuracy of Parent's representations and warranties in
Section 4.9, the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action
and no other corporate proceeding on the part of the Company is necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated
(other than the Stockholder Approval and the filing with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware of the Certificate of Merger as required by the
DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by
Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting
creditors' rights generally, general equitable principles (whether considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law) and any implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing. The only vote of the stockholders of the Company required to
adopt this Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated hereby is the
Stockholder Approval.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Board has (i) unanimously
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are
fair to and in the best interests of the Company's stockholders, (ii)
unanimously approved this Agreement, the Voting Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and (iii) unanimously resolved, subject to
Section 6.4, to recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement by its
stockholders.

  

  

(c) When so executed and delivered in accordance with the Voting Agreement,
the Merger Consent shall constitute a valid and effective Stockholder Approval
in compliance with applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation and By-
Laws, and no other vote or action of the holders of any class or series of the
capital stock of the Company will be necessary under applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or otherwise to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

SECTION 3.5. No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

  

  

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with or result in any violation
or breach of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Company, (ii)
assuming that all consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated by
clauses (i) through (v) of subsection (b) below have been obtained, and all
filings described in such clauses have been made, conflict with or violate any
applicable law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or by which its or any of their respective
properties are bound or (iii) require any consent or other action by any
person under, result in any breach or violation of or constitute a default (or
an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) or
result in the loss or change of a benefit or right under, or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of, any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license, permit,
franchise, approval or similar authorization or other instrument or obligation
(each, a "Contract") to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a
party or by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries or its or any of
their respective properties are bound, except, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii), for any such conflict, violation, breach, default, loss, right or other
occurrence which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
and the consummation of the Merger by the Company do not and will not require
any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or
notification to, any governmental or regulatory (including stock exchange)
authority, agency, court, commission, or other governmental body, domestic,
foreign or supranational (each, a "Governmental Entity"), except for (i)
applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
(including the filing of the Information Statement (as defined below)), the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), and state securities, takeover and "blue sky" laws, (ii) the applicable

notice of any violation of) any applicable law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment or decree applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or by
which its or any of their respective properties are bound, except for any such
violation which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) the Company and its
subsidiaries have all permits, licenses, authorizations, exemptions, orders,
consents, approvals and franchises (collectively, "Licenses") from
Governmental Entities required to conduct their respective businesses as now
being conducted, except for any such Licenses the absence of which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. This Section 3.6(a) does not relate to matters relating to the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which are the subject of Section 3.6(b),
matters relating to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (as defined in Section 3.7(c)),
which are the subject of Section 3.7(c), employee benefit matters, which are

(b) To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has taken any action which would cause the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to be in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977,
as amended (the "Foreign Corrupt Practices Act"), or any applicable law of
similar effect.

  

  

SECTION 3.7. SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

  

  

(a) The Company has filed or otherwise transmitted all forms, reports,
statements, certifications and other documents (including all exhibits,
amendments and supplements thereto) required to be filed by it with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since January 1, 2009 (all such
forms, reports, statements, certificates and other documents filed since
January 1, 2009, collectively, the "Company SEC Reports"). Each of the Company
SEC Reports, as amended, complied as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as
in effect on the date so filed. None of the Company SEC Reports contained,
when filed as finally amended, any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by
reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  

  

(b) The audited consolidated financial statements of the Company (including
any related notes thereto) included in the Company SEC Reports have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in all
material respects applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and the consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity for
the periods indicated. The unaudited consolidated financial statements of the
Company (including any related notes thereto) for all interim periods included
in the Company SEC Reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
all material respects applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated (subject to
normal period-end adjustments).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the
"Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), the Company has been and is in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
There are no outstanding loans or other extensions of credit made by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in
Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of the Company. The Company has
not, since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, taken any action
prohibited by Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  

  

(d) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made
known to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company's
filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company's
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's
system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2010, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective and the Company's independent registered accountant has issued an
attestation report concluding that the Company maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010.

  

  

(e) The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the
Board (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Company's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls over
financial reporting, each of which, in the case of both clauses (A) and (B),
is set forth in Section 3.7(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(f) To the knowledge of the Company, the Company has not identified any
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting. To the knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to
believe that its auditors and its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer will not be able to give the certification and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act when next due.

  

  

SECTION 3.8. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since December 31, 2010,
the business of the Company and its subsidiaries has been conducted in the
ordinary course consistent with past practices and there has not been any
change, event, occurrence, development or state of circumstances or facts that
has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

SECTION 3.9. No Undisclosed Material Liabilities. There are no liabilities or
obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever,
whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise,
and there is no existing condition, situation or set of circumstances that
would reasonably be expected to result in such a liability, other than:

(a) liabilities or obligations disclosed and provided for in the consolidated

(d) liabilities or obligations incurred directly as a result of this
Agreement; and

individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

SECTION 3.10. Absence of Litigation. There are no suits, claims, actions,
proceedings, arbitrations, mediations or investigations pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, or any present or former officer, director or employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries other than any such suit, claim, action,
proceeding, arbitration, mediation or investigation that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of
their respective properties (for which the Company or any of its subsidiaries
is liable) is or are subject to any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree
or award except for those that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no SEC
inquiries or investigations, other governmental inquiries or investigations or
internal investigations pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries or any malfeasance by any executive officer of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries.

Company or any of its subsidiaries as of the date hereof (other than any plan,
program, policy, agreement or arrangement required to be provided under
applicable law) for the benefit of any current, former or retired employee,
officer, consultant, independent contractor or director of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company Employees" and such plans,
programs, policies, agreements and arrangements, collectively, "Company
Plans").

  

  

(b) With respect to each Company Plan, the Company (i) has made available to
Parent a current, accurate and complete copy thereof (or, if a plan is not
written, a written summary of the material terms thereof) and, to the extent
applicable, (x) any summary plan description and (y) the most recently filed
Form 5500, attached schedules, and audited financial statements, if any, and
(ii) will as soon as possible, but in no event more than fifteen calendar days
after the date hereof, make available to Parent a current, accurate and
complete copy of, to the extent applicable, (x) any related trust agreement or
other funding instrument and (y) the most recent determination or opinion
letter, if any, received from the IRS.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Except as failure to do so would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, each Company Plan
has been established and administered in compliance with its terms and in
compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code, and other
applicable laws, rules, and regulations.

  

  

(d) Neither the Company nor any other corporation or other trade or business
that is treated as part of a single employer with the Company under Section

any liability with respect to, any employee benefit plan that is subject to

expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, with respect to each Company
Plan, no actions, suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits) are
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened.

  

  

(g) Each Company Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code has a favorable determination or opinion letter from the Internal
Revenue Service (the "IRS") and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to materially adversely
affect such qualification.

  

  

(h) The execution, delivery of and performance by the Company of its
obligations under the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
(either alone or upon occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) (i)
constitute an event under any Company Plan or any trust or loan related to any
of those plans or agreements that will result in any payment, acceleration,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any Company Employee, or (ii)
result in the triggering or imposition of any restrictions or limitations on
the right of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to amend or terminate any
Company Plan.

  

  

(i) No condition exists that would prevent the Company from amending or
terminating any Company Plan covering a current Company Employee whose primary
place of employment is in the United States or former Company Employee whose
primary place of employment was in the United States (each such plan a "U.S.
Company Plan") without liability, other than the obligation for benefits
accrued prior to the termination of such plan.

  

  

(j) All contributions and premium payments required to have been paid with
respect to each U.S. Company Plan have been paid or, to the extent (if any)
not paid, reflected as a liability in accordance with the Company's ordinary

(k) To the knowledge of the Company, there has been no amendment to, written
interpretation of or announcement (whether or not written) by the Company

U.S. Company Plans which would increase materially the expense of maintaining
such Company Plan above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof

15

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

ARTICLE IV. 
 

  

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

  

PARENT AND MERGER SUB

  

  

Parent and Merger Sub hereby, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to
the Company that, except as set forth on the Disclosure Schedule delivered by
Parent and Merger Sub to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the "Parent Disclosure Schedule") (it being understood that any information
set forth in one section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed to apply to each other section or subsection of this Agreement to
the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such information is relevant to
such other section or subsection) and except as disclosed in any Parent SEC
Report filed on or after December 31, 2010 and prior to the date of this
Agreement (but subject to Section 9.13):

  

  

SECTION 4.1. Organization; Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws.

  

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it
is incorporated and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own,
operate or lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in
good standing or to have such power or authority would not, individually or in
the aggregate, prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent or one of Parent's
wholly-owned subsidiaries owns beneficially and of record all of the
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub free and clear of all security
interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in voting rights,
charges or other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever.

  

  

(b) Parent has heretofore furnished or otherwise made available to the Company
a complete and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation and the by-
laws of each of Parent and Merger Sub as in effect as of the date hereof. Such
organizational documents of Parent and Merger Sub are in full force and effect
and no other organizational documents are applicable to or binding upon Parent
and Merger Sub. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in violation of any
provisions of its organizational documents in any material respect.

  

  

SECTION 4.2. Authority. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by each of Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by each of Parent and
Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

22  

  

 

 

 

  

  

authorized by all necessary action by the Boards of Directors of Parent and
Merger Sub and, promptly after the execution hereof, will be duly and validly
authorized by written consent of the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary
to authorize this Agreement, to perform their respective obligations
hereunder, or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than
the filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of the
Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub
enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or
affecting creditors' rights generally, general equitable principles (whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and any implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing.

  

  

SECTION 4.3. No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

  

  

(a) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with or result in any
violation or breach of the respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws
of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals and
authorizations contemplated by clauses (i) through (v) of subsection (b) below
have been obtained, and all filings described in such clauses have been made,
conflict with or violate any applicable law, rule, regulation, order, judgment
or decree applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or by which either of them or any
of their respective properties are bound or (iii) require any consent or other
action by any person under, result in any breach or violation of or constitute
a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become
a default) or result in the loss or change of a benefit or right under, or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration
of, any Contracts to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which Parent
or Merger Sub or its or any of their respective properties are bound, except,
in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflict, violation,
breach, default, acceleration, loss, right or other occurrence which would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by each of
Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby by each of Parent and Merger Sub do not and will not require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Entity, except for (i) the applicable
requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the HSR Act and state securities, takeover and "blue
sky" laws, (ii) the filing with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL, (iii) the
applicable requirements of Antitrust Laws of jurisdictions other than the
United States and (iv) any such consent, approval, authorization, permit,
action, filing or notification the failure of which to make or obtain would
not prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

SECTION 4.4. Absence of Litigation. There are no suits, claims, actions,
proceedings, arbitrations, mediations or investigations pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its subsidiaries,
other than any such suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation that
would not, or would not reasonably be expected to, prevent, materially delay
or materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
As of the date hereof,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries nor any of their respective
properties is or are subject to any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree
or award that would, or would reasonably be expected to, prevent, materially
delay or materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  

  

SECTION 4.5. Information Statement. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by, or on behalf of, Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Information Statement will, at the date it
is first filed with the SEC and mailed to the stockholders of the Company,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub
make no representation or warranty with respect to any information supplied by
or on behalf of the Company or any of its representatives which is contained
or incorporated by reference in the Information Statement.

sufficient funds to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and all amounts
payable pursuant to Article II of this Agreement.

the issued and outstanding share capital of Merger Sub is, and immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be, owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent.
Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated hereby and prior to the Effective Time will have
engaged in no other business activities and will have incurred no liabilities
or obligations other than in connection herewith or as contemplated herein.

  

  

SECTION 4.9. Ownership of Shares. Except pursuant to the Voting Agreement,
neither Parent nor any of Parent's "Affiliates" or "Associates" directly or
indirectly "owns," beneficially or otherwise, any Shares, as those terms are
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. Other than as contemplated by this
Agreement and the Voting Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries
is, nor has been within the last three years, an "interested stockholder" of
the Company, as such term is defined in Section 203 of the DGCL.

  

  

SECTION 4.10. Vote/Approval Required. No vote or consent of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this
Agreement or the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby. The vote or
consent of the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which shall have occurred prior
to the Effective Time) is the only vote or consent of the holders of any class
or series of capital stock of Merger Sub necessary to approve this Agreement
or the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

SECTION 4.11. No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article IV, the Company

24  

  

 

 

 

  

  

other information provided to the Company in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

irrevocable written consent of the Swartz Family Group in the form attached as
Exhibit A to the Voting Agreement (the "Merger Consent"). The Company shall

delivering the Information Statement to the Company's stockholders as required

27  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Information Statement.
Parent and Merger Sub will cooperate with the Company in the preparation of
the Information Statement. The Company shall promptly furnish the preliminary
Information Statement and the definitive Information Statement, and any
amendments or supplements thereto, to Parent and give Parent and its legal
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such preliminary
Information Statement, or amendment or supplement thereto, prior to filing
with the SEC, and the Company shall consider in good faith all comments of
Parent in connection therewith. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub will furnish to the Company the
information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Information
Statement. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as
soon as reasonably practicable to any SEC comments with respect to the
Information Statement. The Company will use reasonable best efforts to cause
the definitive Information Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the
Company as promptly as practicable after the Information Statement has been
cleared by the SEC or after 10 calendar days have passed since the date of
filing of the preliminary Information Statement with the SEC without notice
from the SEC of its intent to review the Information Statement; provided,
however, that the Company shall have no obligation to mail the definitive
Information Statement until after the date the Stockholder Approval is
obtained. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Information Statement which shall
have become false or misleading. The Company shall as soon as reasonably
practicable notify Parent and Merger Sub of the receipt of any comments from
the SEC with respect to the Information Statement and any request by the SEC
for any amendment or supplement to the Information Statement or for additional
information and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between
the Company and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the
other hand. Parent shall be given a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the response to any SEC comments and to provide comments on any response (to
which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including by
participating in any discussions or meetings with the SEC.

  

  

SECTION 6.2. Resignation of Directors. At the Closing, the Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Parent of the resignation of all directors of the Company and,
as specified by Parent reasonably in advance of the Closing, all directors of
each subsidiary of the Company, in each case, effective at the Effective Time.

  

  

SECTION 6.3. Access to Information; Confidentiality.

  

  

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice, the Company shall, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its subsidiaries, officers,
directors and employees to, afford the officers, employees, auditors and other
authorized representatives of Parent reasonable access, consistent with
applicable law, during normal business hours to its officers, employees,
properties, offices, plants and other facilities (which shall not include any
invasive testing or sampling) and to all books and records, and shall furnish
Parent with all financial, operating and other data and information as Parent,
through its officers, employees or authorized representatives, may from time
to time reasonably request in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such
investigation or consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company or its
subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the
prompt and timely discharge by such employees of their normal duties. Neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to
or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

  

  

reasonably be expected to violate or prejudice the rights of its clients,
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or its subsidiaries or
contravene any applicable law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or
binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and will cause its
partners, members, directors, officers, employees, auditors, agents, advisors,
controlling persons, financing sources and other authorized representatives to
hold and treat in confidence all documents and information concerning the
Company and its subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 6.4. Acquisition Proposals.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 6.4(b), the Company shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries and the officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
representatives and agents of the Company and its subsidiaries to, from the
date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, not (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public
information or providing access to its properties, books, records or
personnel) any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an
Acquisition Proposal (other than with Parent and its representatives) or (iii)
grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement with
respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.4(a), if,
at any time following the date hereof and prior to 11:59 p.m., Boston time, on
July 25, 2011, the Company receives a bona fide Acquisition Proposal from any
person (that does not arise out of a breach of Section 6.4(a) of this
Agreement or Section 5.02 of the Voting Agreement) that the Board determines
in good faith (i) after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take the actions set
forth in clauses (x) and (y) below with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the
Company may, in response to such Acquisition Proposal and until 11:59 p.m.,
Boston time, on July 25, 2011 (after which time the Company and its
representatives shall cease immediately all actions set forth in clauses (x)
and (y) below), (x) furnish information (including non-public information)
with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries to the person who has made
such Acquisition Proposal, pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (with terms
and conditions that are not materially less favorable to the Company than the
Confidentiality Agreement between the Company and Parent dated January 14,
2011) (a copy of which shall be provided to Parent) and (y) participate in
discussions and negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 36 hours after
receipt), notify Parent both orally and in writing of the receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, any inquiries relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any
request for information from, or any negotiations sought to be initiated or
continued with, either the Company or its representatives concerning an
Acquisition Proposal. The Company's written notice shall include a written
summary of the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request, including the identity of the person or group of persons making the
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request. The Company shall as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 24 hours after taking such action) advise
Parent of any decision to take any of the actions referred to in the foregoing
clauses (x) and (y) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably prompt

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

  

  

basis of the status and material terms and conditions (including any change to
the financial terms or any other material term thereof) and developments of
any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request and the status of any
discussions or negotiations with any person making such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry or request. For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal"
means any proposal or offer from any person or "group" (within the meaning of
Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) (other than Parent and its affiliates)
relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of
the consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries or 20% or more of
any class of equity or voting securities of the Company then outstanding, any
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person
(other than any member of the Swartz Family Group, except in the case of any
tender offer made by or on behalf of any member of the Swartz Family Group,
either individually or together with one or more persons) beneficially owning
20% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of the Company then
outstanding, and any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries whose assets together
constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company, other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal increased to 50%) that is on terms that the Board determines in its
good faith judgment, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and after taking into account all legal, financial and
regulatory aspects (including certainty of closing), to be more favorable to
the Company's stockholders than the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 6.4, neither the Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval or
recommendation by the Board of the Merger or this Agreement or the other
transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any of the actions
referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), an "Adverse Recommendation
Change"); provided, however, that the Board may (but subject to Section
6.4(e)), at any time prior to obtaining the Stockholder Approval, effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change (whether or not in response to an Acquisition
Proposal) if the Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside counsel,
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable law; (iii) allow the Company or any of its subsidiaries to
enter into any letter of intent, acquisition agreement or any similar
agreement or understanding (other than a confidentiality agreement having the
terms set forth in Section 6.4(b)) (A) constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or could reasonably be expected to result in, any Acquisition
Proposal or (B) requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement; or (iv) effect
any transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be prohibited from terminating this Agreement in
accordance with its terms. No Adverse Recommendation Change shall change the
approval of the Board for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or
other state law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.4, but subject
to Section 6.4(e), if the Company has received a Superior Proposal after the
date hereof that has not been withdrawn or abandoned, the Board may, at any
time prior to 11:59 p.m., Boston time, on July 25, 2011, terminate this
Agreement in order to cause the Company to concurrently accept such Superior
Proposal; provided, that the Board has concluded, in good faith, after
consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and
outside counsel, that in light of such

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board or such committee to terminate
this Agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties; provided,
further, that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 6.4(d) (and any purported termination pursuant to this Section 6.4(d)
shall be void and of no force or effect), unless prior to or concurrently with
such termination, the Company pays the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 8.2(b).

  

  

(e) Neither the Board nor the Company shall effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to Section 6.4(c) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 6.4(d) unless (i) the Company shall have provided Parent with written
notice at least five business days before taking that action setting forth the
Company's intention to take such action and containing (A), if such action is
intended to be taken in response to an Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms of such Acquisition Proposal, including a copy of the most current
version of the proposed definitive agreement to be entered with, and the
identity of, the person or group of persons making the Acquisition Proposal or
(B), if such action is intended to be taken in circumstances not involving or
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, a reasonably detailed description of the
underlying facts giving rise to, and the reasons for taking, such action, and
(ii) Parent does not provide to the Company, within five business days after
its receipt of that written notification, a written proposal that (A), in the
case of any action intended to be taken in response to an Acquisition
Proposal, is, when taken in the aggregate, equal to, or more favorable than,
such Acquisition Proposal to the stockholders of the Company or (B), in the
case of any action intended to be taken in circumstances not involving or
relating to an Acquisition Proposal, obviates the need for taking such action.
It is understood that in the case of any action intended to be taken in
response to an Acquisition Proposal, any amendment to the financial terms or
other material terms of the Acquisition Proposal shall require a new written
notification from the Company pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence,
except that the Company's advance written notice obligation shall be reduced
to three business days (rather than the five business days otherwise
contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence). The Company agrees that
during any applicable five- or three-business-day period, as the case may be,
referred to in this Section 6.4(e), the Company and its representatives shall
negotiate in good faith with Parent and its representatives regarding any
revisions proposed by Parent to the terms of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  

  

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.4, shall prohibit the Company from
complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act
(or any similar communication to stockholders in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from making any disclosure
to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board,
after consultation with outside counsel, the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or is otherwise required under
applicable law; provided that any such action taken or disclosure made that
relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Board reaffirms the Board's recommendation of
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby in
such statement or disclosure or in connection with such action (except that a
mere "stop, look and listen" disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of
the Exchange Act shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change).

  

  

(g) The Company shall, and shall cause its representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with
any persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and
shall, in accordance with the Company's rights and subject to the Company's
obligations under applicable confidentiality agreements, use its reasonable
best efforts to cause any such person (or its agents, advisors or
representatives) in

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

31  

  

 

 

 

  

  

possession of confidential information of the Company that was furnished by or
on behalf of the Company in connection with a potential sale of the Company to
return or destroy all such information (including any such information
incorporated into any analysis prepared by any such persons or any of their
advisors).

  

  

SECTION 6.5. Employment and Employee Benefits Matters.

  

  

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have
under any Company Plan or under applicable law, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and each of its subsidiaries, for a period commencing at
the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2012, to provide severance and
other separation-related payments and benefits not less favorable, in any
case, than those provided for under the severance- or separation-related
provisions of the Company Plans as in effect on the date hereof for any
Company Employee employed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries on the
date hereof whose employment terminates during that period in circumstances
entitling such Company Employee to payments or benefits under such severance-
or separation-related provisions as in effect on the date hereof (other than
any changes to such severance- or severance-related provisions to the extent
required by applicable law). In respect of the annual cash bonus payable to
the Company Employees for service rendered in fiscal year 2011, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to honor the terms and
conditions of and obligations (existing as of the date of this Agreement)
under the Company's year 2011 annual cash bonus program and the award or
participation agreements thereunder (the "2011 Bonus Program"), which 2011
Bonus Program shall be administered in a manner consistent with the Company's
historic annual bonus programs and any individual agreements with Company
Employees.

  

  

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have
under any Company Plan or under applicable law, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and each of its subsidiaries, for the period commencing
at the Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2012, to maintain for any
Company Employee, (i) subject to paragraph (a) above, compensation levels
(such term to include salary, bonus opportunities and commissions) that in the
aggregate are no less favorable to the Company Employee than the overall
compensation levels maintained for and provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) without limiting the generality
of clause (i) above, base salary or a wage rate that is no less favorable to
the Company Employee than the base salary or wage rate paid to such Company
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) benefits (excluding
any severance or equity-based compensation or awards) that in the aggregate
are no less favorable to the Company Employees in the aggregate than the
overall benefits (and the terms thereof) (excluding any severance or equity-
based compensation or awards) maintained for and provided to such Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the benefits provided under any Company Defined
Contribution Plan that Parent directs the Company to terminate pursuant to
Section 6.5(e) as such benefits are in effect immediately prior to such
Company Defined Contribution Plan's termination); provided, however, subject
to the foregoing, that nothing herein shall be construed (x) as a guarantee of
continued employment of any Company Employee, (y) to prohibit the Surviving
Corporation from terminating the employment of any Company Employee, or (z) to
prevent the amendment or termination of any particular Company Plan or
interfere with the Surviving Corporation's right or obligation to make such
changes as are necessary to conform with applicable law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give each Company Employee full credit for purposes
of eligibility and vesting under any employee compensation and incentive plans
(other than any equity-based compensation plan), benefit (including vacation)
plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of
Company Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its
subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation (each, a "Parent Plan") and full
credit for purposes of benefit accruals under any Parent Plan that provides
for paid vacation or severance, if any, for the Company Employee's service
with the Company, its subsidiaries and their predecessor entities to the same
extent recognized by the Company and the applicable Company Plan or Plans
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, that, with respect to
Parent's 401(k), retirement savings plans and executive deferred savings plan,
service credit shall be given for eligibility purposes but not vesting
purposes relating to employer contributions. With respect to each Parent Plan
that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent
or its subsidiaries shall (i) cause to be waived any pre-existing condition or
eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible
and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by,
and amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees under similar plans maintained by
the Company and its subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will honor, and will cause its
subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms as in effect as of the
date hereof or as amended or entered into as permitted under Section 5.1(g)
(and the Company Disclosure Schedule thereto) (i) each existing employment,
change in control, severance and termination plan, policy, or agreement of or
between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and any Company Employee and
(ii) all obligations pursuant to deferral plans, vested and accrued benefits
under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company or its
subsidiaries and similar employment compensation and benefit arrangements and
agreements, in each case to the extent legally binding on the Company or any
of its subsidiaries.

  

  

(e) Upon the written direction of Parent prior to the Effective Time, (i) the
Company shall amend or cause to be amended any and all U.S. tax-qualified
defined contribution plan(s) that it or its subsidiaries or any of them
maintains (each, a "Company Defined Contribution Plan") to provide that
account balances of Company Employees who participate in a Company Defined
Contribution Plan be fully and immediately vested and nonforfeitable as of the
Effective Time and (ii) the Company shall terminate or shall cause the
termination of the Company Defined Contribution Plans effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall cause its tax-qualified defined
contribution plan ("Parent Defined Contribution Plan") to accept eligible
rollover distributions (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) by
Company Employees with respect to account balances distributed to them on or
as of the Effective Time by a Company Defined Contribution Plan, including, to
the extent permitted under a Company Defined Contribution Plan, outstanding
loan balances of all loans with a term of 120 months or less. Subject to and
without limiting the generality of Section 6.5(c), each Company Employee shall
be eligible effective immediately following the Closing to participate in the
salaried or hourly, as the case may be, Parent Defined Contribution Plan to
the extent permitted by and in accordance with the terms thereof, and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to complete any documents or actions
necessary or appropriate to effectuate such participation as promptly as
practicable following the Closing Date.

  

  

(f) Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall be treated as an amendment of any
Company Plan (or an undertaking to amend any such plan) and, without limiting
the generality of Section 9.6,

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

  

nothing in this Section 6.5 shall confer any rights or benefits on any person
other than the signatories to this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 6.6. Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have
under any employment agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time
through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless
each present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer, director or
employee of the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"),
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines
and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and
disbursements (collectively, "Costs"), incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact
that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, employee, fiduciary
or agent of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the
transactions and actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, (x) each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement
of expenses incurred in the defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation from the Surviving Corporation within ten business days of
receipt by the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request
therefor; provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL, to repay such
advances if it is ultimately adjudicated that such person is not entitled to
indemnification, (y) neither Parent nor Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding or
threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim (and in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to elect to control the defense of any such action or proceeding,
and counsel selected by the Indemnified Party shall, to the extent consistent
with their professional responsibilities, cooperate with Parent and counsel
designated by Parent; provided, however, that if there is a conflict between
Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the Indemnified
Party, on the other hand, in respect of such action or proceeding, Parent
shall not be entitled to elect to control the defense of such action or
proceeding (it being understood that, in such case, the Indemnified Party
shall not be entitled to into any settlement with respect to the such action
or proceeding without the prior written consent of the Parent).

  

  

(b) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and
officers than are presently set forth in the Company's Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals.

  

  

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, either (i)
cause to be obtained at the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies, at no
expense to the beneficiaries, with a claims period of six years from the
Effective Time, from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to directors'
and officers'

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

liability insurance in an amount and scope and on terms at least as favorable
to the Indemnified Parties as the Company's current policies with respect to
matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time or (ii)
maintain at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six years from the
Effective Time the current policies of the directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous to any
beneficiary thereof than those of such policy in effect on the date of the
Agreement) with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time; provided, that, in satisfying its obligation under this
Section 6.6(c), Parent, or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall not
be obligated to pay aggregate premiums in excess of 300% of the amount per
annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year, which amount is set forth
in Section 6.6(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor and perform under all indemnification
agreements entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.6 shall
continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation.

  

  

(e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and
legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

  

  

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in Section 6.5 and this Section 6.6. In addition, the
Surviving Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of any of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
render the Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this
Section 6.6 unless the successor or assign assumes such obligations.

  

  

SECTION 6.7. Further Action; HSR Act and Antitrust Laws.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the other provisions of this
Section 6.7, promptly following execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall (and, to the extent reasonably
necessary, cause their respective affiliates to) (i) prepare and, as promptly
as practicable and in any event within ten (10) business days of the date
hereof (unless Parent and the Company agree otherwise in writing), file, or
cause to be prepared and filed, with the appropriate Antitrust Authorities,
the requisite notifications and reports with respect to the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

35  

  

 

 

 

  

  

transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act, (ii) use
their respective reasonable best efforts to supply all information requested
by Antitrust Authorities in connection with the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as
amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and any other federal, state or foreign law, regulation or decree
designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect
of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"), and
(iii) use their respective reasonable best efforts to comply with, and
cooperate with each other in responding to, any information or document
requests from an Antitrust Authority. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination of
the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act. Parent and the Company shall
each pay fifty percent (50%) of all filing fees payable to Antitrust
Authorities (or foreign equivalents) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the other provisions of this
Section 6.7, the parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
and shall cooperate with one another in connection with the exercise of such
efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable all approvals, orders, permits or
other consents of any applicable Governmental Entities necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the
parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to furnish to the
other parties and, upon request, to any Governmental Entities such information
and assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
foregoing. In connection with the foregoing, each party will (i) promptly
notify the other party in writing of any communication received by that party
or its affiliates from any Governmental Entity, and subject to applicable Law,
provide the other party with a copy of any such written communication (or
written summary of any oral communication), (ii) provide the other party and
its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and will
consider in good faith the comments of the other party in connection with, any
proposed written communication, filing or other submission to any Governmental
Entity in connection with the foregoing, provided that confidential or
competitively sensitive information or material shall be provided solely to
the other party's outside legal counsel on an outside legal counsel basis, and
unless permission is obtained in advance from the party producing the
materials and information, will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers or directors of such other party, and (iii) not
participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
will give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.7,
the parties hereto understand and agree that the reasonable best efforts of
any party hereto shall not be deemed to include (and the Company, without
Parent's prior written consent, shall not take any of the actions referred to
in clauses (i) and (iii) below) (i) entering into any settlement, undertaking,
consent decree, stipulation or agreement with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) litigating,
challenging or taking any other action with respect to any action or
proceeding by any Governmental Entity or (iii) divesting or otherwise holding
separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise), or taking any other
action (or otherwise agreeing to do any of the foregoing) with respect to any
of its or the Surviving Corporation's subsidiaries or any of their respective
affiliates' businesses, assets or properties.

  

  

SECTION 6.8. Financing Cooperation.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(a) The Company shall cooperate with, and cause its subsidiaries and its and
their respective representatives to cooperate with, Parent and its financing
sources in connection with the arrangement of financing related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such cooperation shall include,
to the extent both reasonably requested by Parent and reasonably required in
connection with such financing, (i) furnishing Parent and its financing
sources with financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company
and its subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent, (ii) providing
direct contact between prospective financing sources and the officers the
Company, (iii) providing assistance in extinguishing existing indebtedness of
the Company and its subsidiaries and releasing liens securing such
indebtedness, in each case to take effect at the Effective Time, (iv)
cooperation with respect to matters relating to pledges of collateral to take
effect at the Effective Time in connection with such financing, (v) assisting
Parent in obtaining legal opinions to be delivered in connection with such
financing and (vi) assisting Parent in securing the cooperation of the
independent accountants of the Company and its subsidiaries; provided, in each
case, that (a) such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with
or disrupt the ongoing operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, (b)
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to take any
action that would subject them to any liability or to pay any commitment or
other similar fee in connection with such financing prior to the Effective
Time unless reimbursed or indemnified by Parent to the reasonable satisfaction
of the Company and (c) neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall
be required to enter into any credit agreement, security agreement or other
agreement in connection with the arrangement of financing related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or take any action that would
encumber any of its assets prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
and its subsidiaries for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and costs
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with the
Company's or its subsidiaries' obligations under this Section 6.8 or any other
provision in this Agreement that obligates them to provide cooperation in
connection with the arrangement of financing related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that neither
obtaining financing related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, nor completing any issuance of securities contemplated by such
financing, is a condition to the Closing, and reaffirms its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and
independently of the availability of such financing, or the completion of any
such issuance.

  

  

SECTION 6.9. Public Announcements. The Company and Parent will consult with
each other before issuing any press release or making any public statement
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except
as may be required by applicable law or any listing agreement with, or any
rules of, a national securities exchange, in which case the issuing party will
use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before it
issues any such press release or makes any such public statement; provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to any matter
addressed in Section 6.4.

  

  

SECTION 6.10. Notices of Certain Events. Each party shall promptly notify the
others of:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(a) any notice or other communication from any person alleging that the
consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

  

  

(b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

  

  

provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
6.10 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving that notice.

  

  

SECTION 6.11. Approval by Sole Stockholder of Merger Sub

  

  

. Promptly after the execution hereof, Parent shall cause the sole stockholder
of Merger Sub to approve and adopt this Agreement, in accordance with the
DGCL, by written consent.

Merger Sub) or the failure of such party (or, in the case of Parent, Merger
Sub) to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement required to be
performed at or prior to the Effective Time has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before the Termination
Date and such action or failure to perform constitutes a breach of this
Agreement;

  

  

(d) by the Company (i) if there shall have been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub contained in this Agreement such that the condition set forth in

intentionally and materially breached its obligations under Section 6.4;
provided, however, that notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, after the Condition Date, in no event may Parent terminate this
Agreement under clause (i) of this Section 8.1(e) (x) as a result of the
condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) not being satisfied or (y) to the extent
not permitted by the penultimate sentence of Section 1.2; or

(d) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions

may be made which under applicable law requires the further approval of the
stockholders of the Company without such further approval. This Agreement may
not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties

SECTION 9.12. Interpretation. When reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes"
or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and

modified or supplemented, including (i) in the case of agreements, documents
or instruments, by waiver or consent and (ii) in the case of applicable laws,
by succession of comparable successor statutes. All references in this
Agreement to any applicable law will be deemed to refer also to any rules and

interpretation against the party drafting or causing any instrument to be
drafted.
