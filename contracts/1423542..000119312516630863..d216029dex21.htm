(10) Business Days each (or any longer period as may be approved in advance
by the Company) in order to permit the satisfaction of all of the conditions
to the Offer; and

(C) in the event that all of the conditions to the Offer set forth on _Annex

other than pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of _Section

prior to the then scheduled expiration of the Offer unless this Agreement is

validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to
the holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction for any withholding Taxes
pursuant to _Section 3.8(e)_.

amount equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without
interest thereon, which shall be payable upon the surrender of the certificate
evidencing such share of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in
_Section 3.8_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
upon delivery of an affidavit in the manner provided in _Section 3.10_).

(ii) _Excluded Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
owned by Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company, or by any direct or indirect

"), shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or

-21- (b) _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Company

the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by Company Stockholders who shall have neither voted
in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have
properly and validly perfected their statutory rights of appraisal in respect
of such Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(collectively, " _Dissenting Company Shares_ ") shall not be converted into,
or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to 
_Section 3.7(a)_. Such Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive
payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting
Company Shares held by Company Stockholders who shall have failed to perfect
or who shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of
such Dissenting Company Shares under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall no
longer be considered to be Dissenting Company Shares and shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of
the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that
formerly evidenced such Company Shares in the manner provided in _Section
3.8_.

 

(ii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (B) the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Delaware Law in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld), voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal, or settle or offer to settle any such demands for
payment, in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

(d) _Company Options_. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (i) the vesting of each Company Option that remains outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be accelerated in full, (ii)
each Company Option that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time and
(iii) each holder of each such Company Option shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation promptly after the Effective Time, subject to _Section 3.8(e)_,
an amount in cash (without interest), if any, equal to the product obtained by
_multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares underlying such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, _by_ (y) an amount
equal to (A) the Offer Price, _less_ (B) the per share exercise price of such
Company Option (the " _Option Consideration_ ") (it being understood and
agreed that such 

 



-22-  exercise price shall not actually be paid to the Surviving Corporation by
the holder of a Company Option). Within three (3) Business Days after the
Closing, Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the Surviving Corporation, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay to each of the holders of Company Options, the applicable Option
Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes pursuant to  _Section
3.8(e)_) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than the next
regular payroll date) thereafter.

(e)  _Company RSU Awards_. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (i) the vesting of each Company RSU Award that remains outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be accelerated in full (which,
in the case of a Company RSU Award that vests in whole or in part on the
basis of achievement of performance goals, shall be determined as if
performance were at 100% of targeted performance), (ii) each Company RSU Award
that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time and (iii) each holder of
each such Company RSU Award shall be entitled to be paid by the Surviving
Corporation promptly after the Effective Time, subject to _Section 3.8(e)_,
an amount in cash (without interest), if any, equal to the product obtained by
_multiplying_ (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares underlying such
Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, _by_ (y) the Offer
Price (the " _RSU Consideration_ "). Within three (3) Business Days after the
Closing, Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the Surviving Corporation, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to pay to each of the holders of Company RSU Awards, the applicable RSU
Consideration (less any applicable withholding Taxes pursuant to _Section
3.8(e)_) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than the next
regular payroll date) thereafter.

(f) The Company, the Company Board and any applicable committee thereof
shall take all requisite action to effectuate the provisions of _Section
3.7(d)_ and _Section 3.7(e)_, above.

 

Section 3.8 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Payment Agent, for payment to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_ , an amount of cash equal to
the aggregate consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock are
entitled under this _Article III_ (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
not include the Option Consideration or the RSU Consideration). Until
disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such
funds shall be invested by the Payment Agent, as directed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or obligations of an agency of the United States of America which are
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America (such
cash amount being referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. No
investment or losses thereon shall affect the consideration to which holders
of Company Common Stock are entitled under this _Article III_ and to the
extent that there are any losses with respect to any investments of the
Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the
amount required to

 



-23-  promptly pay in full the cash amounts contemplated by this _Article III_ ,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient to make in full such payments
contemplated by this _Article III_.

 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a
certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") which immediately prior
to the Effective Time evidenced outstanding Company Shares and (ii)
uncertificated Company Shares (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each case,
whose Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.7_ (A) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Payment Agent), and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for
the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions
of this _Article III_. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to
the Payment Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders
of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (x) the
aggregate number of Company Shares represented by such Certificate that were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.7_, _by_  (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding Tax pursuant to _Section 3.8(e)_), and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Upon receipt of an "agents message"
by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares
represented by such holders transferred Uncertificated Shares that were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.7_, by (y) the Merger Consideration (less any applicable
withholding Tax pursuant to _Section 3.8(e)_), and the transferred
Uncertificated Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The
Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated
Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal and reasonable exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of such
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares pursuant to this  _Section 3.8_.
Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall
be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
Company Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than
that in which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered is
registered in the stock transfer

 



-24-  books or ledger of the Company only if such Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender and
transfer and the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any
agent designated by Parent) any transfer or other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, or
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent (or any agent designated
by Parent) that such Taxes have been paid or are otherwise not payable.

 

(e) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, Acquisition Sub
and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of Company Shares, Company Options and Company RSU Awards such amounts
as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable
Tax Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that before making any such deduction or
withholding, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to
the Company, a reasonable period of time prior to Closing, notice of any
applicable payors intention to make such deduction or withholding and, in
reasonable detail, the authority, basis and method of calculation for the
proposed deduction or withholding, and provide the Company with a reasonable
opportunity to obtain reduction of or relief from such deduction or
withholding from the applicable Governmental Authority and/or execute and
deliver to or file with such Governmental Authority and/or Parent such
affidavits, certificates and other documents as may reasonably be expected to
afford to the Company and its stockholders reduction of or relief from such
deduction or withholding. Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Company
to obtain such reduction of or relief from such deduction or withholding. To
the extent that such amounts are so deducted, withheld and remitted to the
applicable Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other party hereto shall be liable to a Company Stockholder for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any Company
Stockholder who has not theretofore surrendered his, her or its Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares evidencing such Company Shares for exchange pursuant
to the provisions of this _Section 3.8_ shall thereafter look for payment of
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Shares represented
by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares solely to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws), as general creditors thereof,
for any claim to the applicable Merger Consideration to which such holders may
be entitled pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

Section 3.9 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and
after the Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares theretofore representing any Company
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect

 



-25-  thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable
therefor upon the surrender thereof in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 3.8_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of the Company Common Stock. From and
after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers
to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades
effected prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article III_. 

Section 3.10 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, in the form and
substance as reasonably requested by the Payment Agent, and the posting by
such holders of a bond in customary and reasonable amount and upon such terms
as may reasonably be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 3.7_.

Section 3.11 _Necessary Further Actions_. As of the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company
and Acquisition Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and
to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Acquisition Sub,
any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger.

ARTICLE IV.

Except (i) as disclosed in the letter delivered by the Company to Parent on
the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), or (ii) as
disclosed in any Company SEC Reports filed with or furnished to the SEC after
January 1, 2015, but prior to the date hereof (other than in any "risk factor"
disclosure or any other forward looking statements set forth therein), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Acquisition Sub as
follows:

Section 4.1  _Organization and Qualification_.

(a) Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly organized and
validly existing and in good standing (to the extent such concepts are
recognized in the applicable jurisdiction) under the Laws of its jurisdiction
of incorporation, with all corporate power and authority to own its properties
and conduct its business as currently conducted, except for such failures to
be in good standing or have such power that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified and in
good standing as a foreign

 



-26-  corporation authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions in which
the character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature
of the business transacted by it makes such qualification necessary, except
for such failures to be so qualified and in good standing that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The Company has heretofore made available to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent
governing documents) as currently in effect for the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries. Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in
compliance in all material respects with the terms of its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent governing documents). Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, owns any interest
in any Person, or has any obligation to acquire any such interest, or to
provide funds to or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in any Person, other than the Companys
Subsidiaries.

Section 4.2  _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 200,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock. At

with respect to 1,780,660 shares of Company Common Stock. From such date
until the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
issued any shares of its capital stock, has granted any options, restricted
stock, stock appreciation rights, warrants or rights or entered into any
other agreements or commitments to issue any shares of its capital stock, or
granted any other awards in respect of any shares of its capital stock or has

validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are free of preemptive
rights. _Section 4.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true,
correct and complete list, as of the date hereof, of all Company Stock
Awards, indicating as applicable, with respect to each Company Stock Award
then outstanding, the type of Company Stock Award granted, the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Award, the date

respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and all other

Section 5.4 _Consents and Approvals; No Violation_. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement by Parent or Acquisition Sub, the performance by Parent and

provision of the respective governing documents of Parent or Acquisition Sub,

Governmental Authority, except (i) as may be required under the HSR Act and
any other Antitrust Laws, or (ii) the applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act, (c) violate, conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of, or
require any consent, waiver or approval or result in a default (or give rise

would constitute a default or give rise to any such right) under any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of any material Contract or obligation to
which Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a
party or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
assets may be bound, or (d) violate any Law or Order applicable to Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (including Acquisition Sub) or by which any of their
respective assets are bound, except in the cases of clauses (b) through (d),
such violations, breaches or defaults which would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent, or materially impair, the
ability of either Parent of Acquisition Sub to consummate the Offer, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.5 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no material Legal
Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against or
relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent, or materially impair, the
ability of either Parent of Acquisition Sub to consummate the Offer,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding Order which
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent, or
materially impair, the ability of either Parent of Acquisition Sub to
consummate the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

Section 5.6 _Interested Stockholder_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective "affiliates" or "associates" (as
such terms are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) is, or has been at any time
during the period commencing three (3) years prior to the date hereof through
the date hereof, an "interested stockholder" of the Company, as such term is

or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of capital stock or
other securities of, or any other economic interest (through derivative
securities or otherwise) in, the Company.

 

Section 5.7 _Sufficient Funds_. Parent current has, and will have at all times
from and after the date hereof and through the Acceptance Time and the
Effective Time available to it, and Acquisition Sub will have as of the
Acceptance Time and at the Effective Time, sufficient funds for the
satisfaction of all of Parents and Acquisition Subs obligations under this
Agreement, including the payment of the aggregate Offer Price and Merger
Consideration and the consideration in respect of the Company Stock Awards and
to pay all related fees and expenses. Parents and Acquisition Subs
obligations hereunder, including their obligations to consummate the Merger,
are not subject to a condition regarding Parents or Acquisition Subs
obtaining of funds to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

Section 5.8 _Brokers_. The Company will not be responsible for any brokerage,
finders, financial advisors or other fee or commission payable to any
broker, finder or investment banker in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by and on behalf
of Parent and Acquisition Sub.

 



-48- Section 5.9 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub is entering into
this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors of the Company. Immediately after giving effect to all of
this Agreement, the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration and any
other repayment or refinancing of debt that may be contemplated, and payment
of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent.
For purposes of this _Section 5.9_, the term " _Solvent_ " with respect to
the Surviving Corporation means that, as of any date of determination, (a)
the amount of the fair saleable value of the assets of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, exceeds, as of such date,
the sum of (i) the value of all Liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including contingent and other
liabilities, as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in
accordance with the applicable Laws governing determinations of the solvency
of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
Liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole on its existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and matured; (b) the Surviving Corporation will not have, as
of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
business in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged by Parent
following such date; and (c) the Surviving Corporation will be able to pay
its Liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.

 

Section 5.10 _Absence of Certain Arrangements._

 

(a) There are no Contracts or understandings between Parent or Acquisition Sub
any of their respective Affiliates or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
of their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any member of the
Companys management or directors, on the other hand, as of the date hereof
that relate in any way to the Company or the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, nor any of their respective Affiliates
has entered into any Contract, or authorized, committed or agreed to enter
into any Contract, pursuant to which: (i) any stockholder of the Company would
be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the
Offer, (ii) any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote against, or not to
tender his, her or its shares of capital stock of the Company in, any
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any Person has agreed to provide, directly or
indirectly, equity capital to Parent or the Company to finance in whole or in
part the Merger.

Section 5.11 _Acquisition Sub_. Acquisition Sub was formed solely for
the purpose of engaging in the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and has engaged in no business other than in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.12 _Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties._ Parent and
Acquisition Sub each acknowledges and agrees that, except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, (a)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries makes, or has made, any
representations or warranties relating to itself or its business or otherwise
in connection with the Merger and Parent and Acquisition Sub are not

 



-49-  relying on any representation or warranty except for those expressly set
forth in this Agreement, (b) no Person has been authorized by the Company or

estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial information, memoranda,
presentations or any other materials or information provided or addressed to
Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their Representatives are not and shall not
be deemed to be or include representations or warranties unless any such

warranty set forth in _Article IV_ of this Agreement.

Section 6.2 _Go-Shop; Adverse Recommendation Change_. 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period beginning on the date of the public announcement of this
Agreement and continuing until 11:59 p.m. (EST) on the date that is thirty
(30) days after the date of the public announcement of this Agreement (the "
_Solicitation Period End-Date_ "), the Company, its Subsidiaries and its
Representatives shall have the right (acting under the direction of the
Company Board) to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate and encourage
any Acquisition Proposals (or inquiries, proposals or other offers
or attempts that are reasonably expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal),
including by way of providing access to non-public information pursuant to
(but only pursuant to) an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement _provided_ that
any non-public information provided to any Person given such access shall
have been previously provided to Parent or shall be promptly provided to
Parent (or Parent shall be given access) and (ii) enter into and maintain
discussions or negotiations with respect to Acquisition Proposals or
otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate, any such
discussions or negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

 



-52- (b) Subject to _Section 6.2(c)_, from the Solicitation Period End-Date until
the Acceptance Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VII_, the Company shall not, and shall not permit or
authorize any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives, directly or indirectly,
to (i) solicit, initiate, endorse, or knowingly facilitate any inquiry,

terminate all physical and electronic data room access previously granted to
any such Person, (2) request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal, and (3) not terminate, waive,
amend, release or modify any provision of any confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which it or any of its Affiliates or Representatives is a party
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal,
and shall enforce the provisions of any such agreement, which shall include
seeking any injunctive relief available to enforce such agreement ( _provided_
that the Company shall be permitted to grant waivers of, and not enforce, the
terms of any confidentiality or standstill agreement, but solely to the extent
that the Company Board has determined in good faith that failure to take such
action (x) would prohibit the counterparty from making an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board in compliance with this _Section
6.2_ or (y) would constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company
Stockholders under applicable Law).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at any time
following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Acceptance Time, (i)
the Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
believes in good faith to be bona fide, (ii) such Acquisition Proposal was
unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a breach of this  _Section
6.2_, and (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the
Company may (x) furnish information or data with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that any non-
public information provided to any such Person shall have been previously
provided to Parent or shall be provided to Parent prior to or concurrently
with the time it is provided to such Person (or Parent shall be given access
to such information) and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition
Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section 6.2_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Company, its Subsidiaries and its
Representatives may, in any event, contact any third party to (i) seek to
clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any inquiry or proposal
made by such third party solely to determine whether such inquiry or proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and
(ii) inform such third party that has made or, to the knowledge of the
Company, is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, of the provisions of
this _Section 6.2_.

 



-53- (d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

 

(i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or
Acquisition Sub) the recommendation that the holders of Company Shares accept
the Offer and tender their Company Shares to Acquisition Sub pursuant to the
Offer, (B) recommend or otherwise declare advisable the approval by the
Company Stockholders of any Acquisition Proposal, or (C) resolve or agree
to take any such actions (each such action set forth in this _Section
6.2(d)(i)_ being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_
"); or

 

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other Contract, except for an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement (each, an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ")
in each case constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would be
reasonably expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, or resolve, agree or
propose to take any such actions.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board shall be permitted,
subject to compliance with this _Section 6.2(d)_, (x) to terminate this
Agreement to concurrently enter into a definitive Alternative Acquisition
Agreement and/or (y) to effect any Adverse Recommendation Change, if, in each
case, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company may not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.1(e)_ unless:

 

(A) the Company notifies Parent in writing at least three (3) Business Days
before taking that action of its intention to do so, and, as applicable,
which notice, to the extent permitted under the terms of any Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, specifies the reasons therefor, including the
material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, the identity of the
party making such Superior Proposal and a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with such party, or in the case of any Adverse
Recommendation Change that is not related to a Superior Proposal, a reasonably
detailed summary of the basis of such action (it being understood and agreed
that any amendment to the material financial terms or any other material term
of such Superior Proposal (including any revision in the amount, form or mix
of consideration the Company Stockholders would receive as a result of such
potential Superior Proposal) or any material change to the facts and
circumstances relating to the Adverse Recommendation Change shall require a
new written notice by the Company and an additional two (2) Business
Day period); and

(B) if Parent makes a proposal during such three (3) Business Day period (or,
in the case of a new written notice, such two (2) Business Day period) to
adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement (which shall be in writing
in a form that would create a binding contract if accepted by the Company),
the Company Board, after taking into consideration the adjusted terms and
conditions of this Agreement as proposed by Parent, continues to determine in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and its financial

 



-54-  advisor) that such Superior Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal or
that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this
Agreement, as applicable, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the Company Stockholders under applicable Law. During the two (2) Business Day
period prior to its effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating
this Agreement as referred to above, the Company shall, and shall cause its
financial and legal advisors to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the
extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the terms of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement
unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms
(including the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_,
if applicable).

(e) From and after the Solicitation Period End-Date, the Company as promptly
as reasonably practicable, and in any event within two (2) Business Days of
receipt, shall advise Parent in writing in the event the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any inquiry or request for
information, discussion or negotiation that is reasonably likely to lead to or
that contemplates an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) to the extent permitted by
any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, any proposal or offer that is or is
reasonably likely to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, in each case together
with a description of the material terms and conditions of and facts
surrounding any such indication, inquiry, request, proposal or offer, and a
copy of any written proposal, offer or draft agreement provided by such
Person. The Company shall keep Parent informed (orally and in writing) in all
material respects on a reasonably timely basis of the status and details
(including, within two (2) Business Days after the occurrence of any
amendment) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request, inquiry, proposal or
offer, including, to the extent permitted by any Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, furnishing copies of any written draft documentation. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board,
directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from (i) taking and
disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position with respect to a tender or
exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Company Stockholders), (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication
to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (iii) any other communication to the Company Stockholders if
(in the case of this clause (iii)) the Company Board has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, that
the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that any disclosure referred
to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly reaffirms the Board
Recommendation in such disclosure.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means, other than the Merger or any other
proposal or offer from Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates, any proposal, offer or inquiry from a Person relating to (A) any
acquisition or purchase, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions, of (1) twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2) Company Securities
representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the combined voting power of
the Company; (B) any tender offer 

 



-55-  or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or group
acquiring beneficial ownership of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the
combined voting power of the Company; (C) the issuance by the Company of
Company Securities representing twenty-five percent (25%) or more of its
voting securities; or (D) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, share exchange or other
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in which a Person
or its stockholders, if consummated, would acquire twenty-five percent (25%)
or more of the combined voting power of the Company or the surviving entity
or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving
entity.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
that the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and its financial advisor), taking into account all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, the Person making
the proposal, and such other factors as the Company Board considers to be
appropriate, is more favorable to Company Stockholders from a financial point
of view than the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any adjustment to the terms and conditions proposed by
Parent in response to such proposal); _provided_ that, for purposes of this
definition of "Superior Proposal," references in the term
"Acquisition Proposal" to "25%" shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

(iii) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means (i) any
confidentiality agreement entered into by the Company from and after the date
of this Agreement that contains confidentiality provisions that are not
materially less favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, except that such confidentiality
agreement need not include explicit or implicit standstill provisions that
would restrict the making of or amendment or modification to Acquisition
Proposals, or (ii) any confidentiality agreement entered into prior to the
date of this Agreement, it being understood that the Company, in its sole
discretion, shall be entitled to waive or release any preexisting explicit or
implicit standstill provisions or similar agreements with any Person or group
of Persons.

all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other party or parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to (i)
cause the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_ and _Annex
A_ to be satisfied and cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in
_Article VIII_ to be satisfied; (ii) obtain all necessary actions or non-
actions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from
Governmental Authorities and make all necessary registrations, declarations
and filings with Governmental Authorities, that are necessary to consummate
the Offer and the Merger; and (iii) obtain all necessary or appropriate
consents, waivers and approvals under any Material Contracts to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in connection with

 



-56-  this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
In addition to the foregoing, neither Parent or Acquisition Sub, on the one
hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, shall take any action, or fail to
take any action, that is intended to, or has (or would reasonably be expected
to have) the effect of, preventing, impairing, delaying or otherwise adversely
affecting the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or the ability of such
party to fully perform its obligations under the Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Company shall not be required prior to
the Effective Time to pay any consent or other similar fee, "profit-sharing"
or other similar payment or other consideration (including increased rent or
other similar payments or any amendments, supplements or other modifications
to (or waivers of) the existing terms of any Contract), or the provision of
additional security (including a guaranty) or otherwise assume or agree to
assume any Liability that is not conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger, to obtain any consent, waiver or approval of any Person (including
any Governmental Authority) under any Contract.

(b) Parent agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that, between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to (i) enter into or consummate any agreements or
arrangements for an acquisition (via stock purchase, merger, consolidation,
purchase of assets or otherwise) of any ownership interest or assets of any
Person if such ownership interest or assets would reasonably be expected to
result in any delay in obtaining, or to result in the failure to obtain, any
regulatory approvals required in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger), or (ii) take or agree to take any
other action (including entering into agreements with respect to any equity
investments, joint ventures, acquisitions, mergers, consolidations or
business combinations) which would reasonably be expected to result in any
delay in obtaining, or which would reasonably be expected to result in the
failure to obtain, any approvals of any Governmental Authority required
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger), or which would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent or delay
the Merger.

 

Section 7.2 _Antitrust Filings_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall file
with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report
Form relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby as
required by the HSR Act as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days following the
date of this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) cooperate and
coordinate with the other in the making of such filings, (ii) supply the other
with any information and documentary material that may be required in order
to make such filings, (iii) supply as promptly as reasonably practicable to
the FTC or the DOJ any additional information that reasonably may be required
or requested by the FTC or the DOJ and (iv) take any and all action necessary
or advisable to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable and to obtain prompt approval
of the consummation of the Offer or the Merger under any Antitrust Laws,
including (1) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, conduct of business restrictions, a
sale or disposition of such assets or businesses as are required to be
divested or a license or grant of commercialization rights to businesses,
product lines, fields of use, or assets of Parent or its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation and its
Affiliates), (2)

 



-57-  amending any venture or other arrangement of Parent or its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates), (3) cooperating with
each other and using their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist any Legal Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Order that may result from such Legal Proceedings, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (4) otherwise taking or committing to take actions after the
Closing with respect to one or more of the businesses, product lines, fields
of use, or assets of Parent and its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation and its Affiliates), in each case, as may be required in order to
enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger, to occur as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later
than the Termination Date) and to otherwise avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any preliminary or permanent injunction which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger. Further, and for the avoidance of
doubt, Parent will not extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or enter
into any agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ or any
other Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the Company.

 

(b) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if
applicable), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall
promptly inform the other of any communication from any Governmental Authority
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection
with any filings or investigations with, by or before any Governmental
Authority relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including any proceedings initiated by a private party. If any party hereto or
an Affiliate thereof shall receive a request for additional information or
documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the HSR Act with
respect to which any such filings have been made, then such party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, to the extent reasonably practicable and
unless prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Authority, the parties hereto agree to (i) give each other reasonable advance
notice of all meetings and conference calls with any Governmental Authority
relating to the Offer or the Merger, (ii) give each other an opportunity to
participate in each of such meetings and conference calls, (iii) keep the
other party reasonably apprised with respect to any oral communications with
any Governmental Authority regarding the Offer or the Merger, (iv) cooperate
in the filing of any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions or other written communications explaining or defending the Offer and
the Merger, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument and/or
responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental Authority, (v)
provide each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment
upon, and consider in good faith the views of the other with respect to, all
written communications (including any analyses, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments and opinions) with a Governmental Authority regarding the
Offer and the Merger, (vi) provide each other (or counsel of each party,
as appropriate) with copies of all written communications to or from any
Governmental Authority relating to the Offer or the Merger and (vii) cooperate
and provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to participate in, and
consider in good faith the

 



-58-  views of the other with respect to, all material deliberations with respect
to all efforts to satisfy the conditions set forth in clauses (A) and (C)(1)
of _Annex A_ and  _Section 8.1(b)_. Any such disclosures, rights to
participate or provisions of information by one party to the other may be made
on a counsel-only basis to the extent required under applicable Law or to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company.

(c) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate with one
another in good faith to (i) promptly determine whether any filings not
contemplated by _Section 7.2(a)_ are required to be or should be made, and
whether any other consents, approvals, permits or authorizations not
contemplated by _Section 7.2(a)_ are required to be or should be obtained,
from any Governmental Authority under any other applicable Law in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) promptly make any filings,
furnish information required in connection therewith and seek to obtain
timely any such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers that
the parties determine are required to be or should be made or obtained in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 7.3 _Merger_. Following the consummation of the Offer, each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company shall take all necessary and appropriate
actions to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after
the Acceptance Time, without a meeting of the Company Stockholders, in
accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL and upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement. In furtherance, and without limiting the
generality, of the foregoing, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub nor the
Company shall, and shall not permit and shall cause their respective
Affiliates or Representatives not to, take any action that could render
Section 251(h) of the DGCL inapplicable to the Merger.

Section 7.4  _Public Statements and Disclosure_. None of the Company, on the
one hand, or Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall issue (or
shall cause its Affiliates or Representatives to issue) any public release or
make any public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
except as such release or announcement is required by applicable Law or the
rules or regulations of NASDAQ, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the
other party or parties hereto a reasonable opportunity to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance (it being understood that
the final form and content of any such release or announcement, as well as the
timing of any such release or announcement, shall be at the final discretion
of the disclosing party); _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 7.4_ shall not apply (i) to any release or
announcement made or proposed to be made by the Company with respect to the
matters addressed in _Section 6.2_ or (ii) to bring or defend a claim in
connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 7.5 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover or
other similar Law is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and Company Board
shall grant such approval and take such action as necessary so that such
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in

 



-59-  this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that nothing in
the foregoing shall require the Company Board to take any action that would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 

Section 7.6 _Access_. At all times during the period commencing on the date of
this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall afford Parent, Acquisition Sub, their officers, a reasonable
number of their employees and their financial advisors, business consultants,
legal counsel, accountants and other agents and representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, to the
properties, books and records, contracts, analyses, tax returns, data,
regulatory materials, reports, projections, plans, systems, senior
management, commitments, offices and other facilities, properties and
personnel of the Company; _provided, however_ , that the Company may restrict
or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent
that (i) any applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or otherwise
prohibit access to such documents or information, (ii) granting such access
would violate any obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to confidentiality to any Person or otherwise breach, contravene or
violate any then effective Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, (iii) access to such documents or information
would give rise to a risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege, work
product doctrine or other applicable privilege applicable to such documents or
information, or (iv) access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a default
under, or give a Person the right terminate or accelerate the rights under,
such Contract. In the event that the Company does not provide access or
information in reliance on the preceding sentence, it shall use its
reasonable best efforts to communicate the applicable information to Parent in
a way that would not violate the applicable Law, Contract or obligation or
waive such a privilege. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _Section 7.6_ shall be conducted in a manner that does
not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property
or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any access to the
properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be subject to the
Companys reasonable security measures and insurance requirements and shall
not include the right to perform invasive testing without the Companys prior
written consent, in its sole discretion. The terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information obtained by Parent or
any of its financial advisors, business consultants, legal counsel,
accountants and other agents and representatives in connection with any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
7.6_. Nothing in this _Section 7.6_ shall be construed to require the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Representatives of any of the
foregoing to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other
information.

 

Section 7.7 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
"derivative securities" (as defined in Rule 16a-1(c) under the Exchange Act))
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is a director or executive officer of the Company to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



-60- Section 7.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
shall (and, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries under (i) the indemnification agreements
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective current or former directors and officers and any person who
becomes a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified Persons_ "), and (ii)
indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation provisions in any
certificate of incorporate or bylaws or comparable organizational document of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect on the date of this
Agreement. In addition, during the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time to) cause the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (and
other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries as of the Acceptance Time to contain provisions with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are no less
favorable than the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses
provisions contained in the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or
other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
of the date hereof, and during such six (6) year period, such provisions shall
not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except
as required by applicable Law or as provided below.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Section
7.8(a)_, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time to) indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, Liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such
claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out
of or pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged
action or omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director,
officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates (regardless of whether such action or omission, or alleged action
or omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time), or (ii) any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time to) advance, prior to the final disposition of any claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought
under this Agreement, promptly following request by an Indemnified Person
therefor, all costs, fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and investigation expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection
with any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry upon receipt of an
undertaking by such Indemnified Person to repay such advances if it is
ultimately decided in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent

 



-61-  jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification
hereunder. If, at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice
asserting in good faith a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses
under this  _Section 7.8(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice shall
survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as
such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have
the right to control the defense thereof after the Acceptance Time, (ii) each
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to retain his or her own counsel,
whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of
any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, (iii) the Surviving
Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of any
counsel retained by an Indemnified Person, promptly after statements therefor
are received, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control
the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, and (iv)
no Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without his
or her prior express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this _Section 7.8(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither
the Surviving Corporation nor any of its Affiliates (including Parent) shall
settle or otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry for which indemnification may be sought by an
Indemnified Person under this Agreement unless such settlement, compromise,
consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnified
Persons from all liability arising out of such claim, proceeding,
investigation or inquiry.

(c) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth
(6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect directors
and officers liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person covered by the
Companys currently in force directors and officers ( _provided_ that Parent
may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound
carriers of at least the same coverage and amounts containing term and
conditions which are no less advantageous) liability insurance (" _Current
Company D andO Insurance_"), on terms with respect to the coverage and amounts
that are no less favorable than those of the Current Company DandO Insurance;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under this
_Section 7.8(c)_, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of
the annual amount paid by the Company for coverage during its current coverage
period (such three hundred percent (300%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual
Premium_ "); _provided_ that, if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for the
Maximum Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six
(6) year "tail" prepaid policy on the Current Company DandO Insurance. In the
event that the Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu
of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the
first sentence of this _Section 7.8(c)_ for so long as such "tail" policy
shall be maintained in full force and effect.

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (or any of its
successors or assigns) (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in
this _Section 7.8_.

 



-62- Section 7.9 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" (or similar phrase)
within the meaning of the Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the
Acceptance Time, as applicable. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to assume, honor, and/or provide all of the Companys severance
and change in control obligations in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement.

(b) Except to the extent prohibited by applicable Laws, for a period of
twelve (12) months following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation

Continuing Employee (i) a base salary or wage rate, as applicable, and annual
cash bonus opportunity that is not less favorable than the base salary or
wage rate (as applicable) and annual bonus opportunity provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) other
compensation and benefits (as described in _Section 4.11_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter (including severance, benefits and the cash value of any
equity based compensation) but excluding (y) any equity-based compensation
(other than the cash value of any equity-based compensation) and (z) benefits
provided pursuant to any defined benefit pension plans) that are, taken as a
whole, at least as favorable in the aggregate to the other compensation and
benefits described in _Section 4.11_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) From and after the Closing, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to provide, each Continuing
Employee with full credit for all service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for all purposes, including
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length
of service is relevant, under any employee benefit plans, arrangements,
collective agreements and employment-related entitlements (including under
any applicable pension, 401(k), savings, medical, dental, life insurance,
vacation, long-service leave or other leave entitlements, post-retirement
health and life insurance, termination indemnity, severance or separation pay
plans) provided, sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under the Plans; _provided, however_ , that such service need not
be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or
benefits, it was not recognized under the corresponding Plan or to the extent
it is prohibited by applicable Law. In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall (or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) ensure that (i) each Continuing Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all employee benefit plans sponsored by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and their Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees participate to the
extent coverage under any such plan replaces coverage under a comparable Plan
in which such Continuing Employee participates immediately before the
Effective Time; and (ii) for purposes of each plan providing

 



-63-  medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision and/or disability benefits to any
Continuing Employee, all waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions,
evidence of insurability requirements and actively-at-work or similar
requirements of such plan will be waived for such Continuing Employee and his
or her covered dependents, and full credit will be given for any eligible
expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents during any unfinished portion of the plan year ending on
the date such employees participation in the corresponding new plan begins
for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such new plan, and (iii) the accounts of such
Continuing Employees under any new plan that is a flexible spending plan are
credited with any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee
under the applicable plan; _provided, however_ , that such service need not be
credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or
benefits or to the extent it is prohibited by applicable Law.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate, any Continuing Employee for any reason, or (ii)
require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any Plan or prevent
the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time.
The provisions of this _Section 7.9_ are solely for the benefit of
the parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 7.9_
shall create such rights in any such persons. With respect to matters
described in this _Section 7.9_, the Company will not send any written
notices or other written communication materials to Continuing Employees
without the prior written consent of Parent. Nothing in this Agreement shall
be deemed to be or construed or interpreted as an amendment to any existing
Plan.

necessary to cause Acquisition Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform
their respective obligations under this Agreement before and after the

and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Acceptance Time, the Company shall

or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of the Company to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in any
such case if and only to the extent that such untruth or inaccuracy, or such
failure, would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the
obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby set forth in _paragraphs (C)(2)_ and _(C)(3)_ of _Annex
A_ to fail to be satisfied at the then scheduled expiration of the Offer;
_provided, however_ , that no such notification shall

 



-64-  affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company
set forth in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and
Acquisition Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the remedies available to the parties hereunder; and _provided further_ ,
that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to
any information provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.11(a)_.

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Effective Time,
Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that any
representation or warranty made by Parent or Acquisition Sub in this
Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any
failure of Parent or Acquisition Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material
respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement, in any such case if and only to the extent that
such untruth or inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected to
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent and
Acquisition Sub to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) or the ability of Parent
and Acquisition Sub to fully perform their respective covenants and
obligations under this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of Parent or Acquisition Sub set forth in this Agreement or the
conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies available to the parties
hereunder; and _provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information provided to the
Company pursuant to this _Section 7.11(b)_.

Section 7.12 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent
of any litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any
of its directors or executive officers (in their capacity as such) by any
Company Stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of the Company)
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall
keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. The Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the
defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation and no such
settlement in excess of $100,000 shall be agreed to without Parents prior
consent (which shall be not unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

Section 7.13 _Rule 14d-10(d) Exemption_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company (acting through the compensation committee of the Company Board)
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause each agreement,
arrangement or understanding entered into by the Company or a Subsidiary of
the Company on or after the date hereof with any of its officers, directors or
employees pursuant to which consideration is paid to such officer, director
or employee to be approved as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under
the Exchange Act and to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe
harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

 



-65- Section 7.14 _De-Listing_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Parent to cause the Company Shares to be de-listed

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 

Section 9.1 _Termination Prior to the Acceptance Time_. This Agreement may be
terminated and the Offer may be abandoned at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time (it being agreed that the party hereto terminating this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.1_ shall give prompt written notice of such
termination to the other party or parties hereto and that any termination by
Parent also shall be an effective termination by Acquisition Sub):

(a) by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company; or

 



-66- (b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Acceptance Time shall not have
occurred on or before the six-month anniversary of the date hereof (the "
_Termination Date_ "), or if there exists any Restraint having the effect set

this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 9.1(b)_ shall not be available to
any party hereto whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the principal cause of or resulted in (i) any of the

and such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this
Agreement, or (ii) the expiration or termination of the Offer in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Offer without Acquisition Sub having
accepted for payment any Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer and
such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement;
or

 

(c) by the Company, in the event that (i) the Company is not then in material
breach of this Agreement, (ii) Parent and/or Acquisition Sub shall have
breached or otherwise violated any of their respective material covenants or
agreements, or other material obligations under this Agreement, or any of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Acquisition Sub set forth in
this Agreement shall have become inaccurate, which breach, violation or
inaccuracy, individually or in the aggregate with other such breaches,
violations or inaccuracies, would reasonably be expected to prevent the
consummation of the Offer prior to the Termination Date, and (iii) such
breach, violation or failure to perform described in _clause (ii)_ is not
capable of being cured or is not cured within thirty (30) Business Days
following the Companys delivery of written notice to Parent of such breach,
violation or failure to perform; or

(d) by Parent, in the event that (i) (A) Parent and Acquisition Sub are not
then in material breach of this Agreement, (B) the Company shall have breached

warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement shall have become
inaccurate, in either case such that the conditions to the Offer set forth in
_Annex A_ are not capable of being satisfied by the Termination Date, and (C)
such breach, violation or failure to perform described in _clause (B)_ is not
capable of being cured or is not cured within thirty (30) Business Days
following Parents delivery of written notice to the Company of such breach,

_Annex A_ are not capable of being satisfied by the Termination Date; or

 

(e) by the Company, in the event that (i) the Company shall have received a
Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company Board shall have determined to terminate
this Agreement or effected or resolved to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change in accordance with the terms set forth in _Section 6.2(e)(iii)_, and
(iii) the Company Board pays Parent the Termination Fee payable to Parent
pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)(ii)_; or

(f) by Parent, in the event that (i) the Company Board or any committee
thereof shall have effected or resolved to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change, or (ii) a tender or exchange offer relating to the Companys
securities shall have been commenced by a Person unaffiliated with Parent and
the Company shall not have sent to its security holders pursuant to

 



-67-  Rule 14D-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, within ten (10) Business Days
after such tender or exchange offer is first published, sent or given, a
statement disclosing that the Company Board recommends rejection of such
tender or exchange offer and reaffirming the Company Boards recommendation
that the holders of Company Shares accept the Offer and tender their Company
Shares to Acquisition Sub pursuant to the Offer.

 

Section 9.2 _Termination Before or After Acceptance Time and Prior to
Effective Time_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer and/or the
Merger may be abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time (it being
agreed that the party hereto terminating this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.2_ shall give prompt written notice of such termination to
the other party or parties hereto), by either Parent or the Company in the
event of a Restraint (which has become final and non-appealable).

 

Section 9.3 _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any proper and
valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to  _Section 9.1_ or _Section
9.2_ shall be effective immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the
terminating party to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable. In the
event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_ or
_Section 9.2_, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect without
liability of any party or parties hereto, as applicable (or any director,
officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or other representative of such party or
parties) to the other party or parties hereto, as applicable, except (a) for
the terms of _Article IV_ , _Section 7.4_, this _Section 9.3_, _Section
9.4_ and _Article X_ , each of which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement, and (b) that nothing herein shall relieve any party or parties
hereto, as applicable, from any liability or damages (which the parties
acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of out-of-pocket
fees, costs or expenses incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated, and may include, to the extent proven, the benefit of the
bargain lost by a partys stockholders (taking into consideration relevant
matters, including other combination opportunities and the time value of
money), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of such party)
hereby resulting from any willful or intentional breach of this Agreement that
occurs prior to such termination, in which case the aggrieved party shall be
entitled to all remedies available at Law or in equity. In addition to the
foregoing, no termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of
the parties hereto set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which
obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with
their terms.

 

Section 9.4 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) _General_. Except as set forth in this _Section 9.4_, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party or parties, as applicable,
incurring such expenses whether or not the Offer and/or the Merger is
consummated.

 

(b) _Termination Fee_.

 

(i) The Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing
by Parent, within two (2) Business Days after demand by Parent, in the event
that (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)_ as a result 

 



-68-  of the failure to satisfy the Minimum Condition prior to such termination
(provided, that (x) the condition to the Offer set forth in clause (A) of
_Annex A_ is satisfied at the time of such termination pursuant to _Section
9.1(b)_, (y) the condition to the Offer set forth in clause (C)(1) of _Annex
A_ is satisfied at the time of such termination pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_,
except where the failure to meet such condition arises out of or results from
a Legal Proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Person who has made the
bonda fide Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (B) below and (z) the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)_ is then
available to Parent); (B) following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and prior to such termination of this Agreement, a bona fide
Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or shall have become
publicly disclosed and, in either case, shall not have been withdrawn or
otherwise abandoned; and (C) within twelve (12) months following such
termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into a definitive agreement
with any Person (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub, or their Affiliates) with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal is consummated.
For purposes of the foregoing, each reference to "25%" in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%".

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to _Section 9.1(e)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee,
within two (2) Business Days after demand by Parent, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing
by Parent.

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.1(f)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee, within
two (2) Business Days after demand by Parent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

(c) The payment by the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section 9.4(b)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and
Acquisition Sub in the event of termination of this Agreement under
circumstances requiring the payment of a Termination Fee pursuant to this
_Section 9.4(b)_.

 

(d) _Single Payment Only_. The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one (1) occasion, whether or not the Termination Fee may be payable
under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different
times and the occurrence of different events.

 

(e) _Consequence of Non-Payment_. The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in _Section 9.4(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to
promptly pay the amount due pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_ and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent
its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest at a rate per annum equal to the prime lending
rate prevailing during the period as published in The Wall Street Journal.

 

(f) _Transfer Taxes_. Except as expressly provided in _Section 3.8(d)_, all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar
Taxes and fees incurred in connection with the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement shall be paid by Parent and Acquisition Sub, when due.

 



-69- Section 9.5 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time prior to the Effective Time by execution of an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 9.5_, _Section 9.6_,
_Section 10.3_, _Section 10.6_, _Section 10.8_, and _Section 10.9_, may
not be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of
conduct or otherwise in a way that would reasonably be expected to be adverse
to the Financing Sources, except by an instrument in writing signed by the
Agent (as such term is defined in the applicable Debt Financing Documents)
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 9.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time and from time to time prior to
the Effective Time, any party or parties hereto may, to the extent legally
allowed and except as otherwise set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party or
parties hereto, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party or parties hereto contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party or
parties hereto contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party or
parties hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party or parties,
as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Section 9.5_, this _Section
9.6_, _Section 10.3_, _Section 10.6_, _Section 10.8_, and _Section 10.9_,
may not be waived in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise in
a way that would reasonably be expected to be adverse to the Financing
Sources, except by an instrument in writing signed by the Agent (as such term
is defined in the applicable Debt Financing Documents) (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Any delay in exercising any
right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right. The
conditions to each of the parties obligations to consummate the Merger are
for the sole benefit of such party and may be waived by such party in whole or
in part to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

ARTICLE X.

Section 10.3 _Assignment_. No party may assign (by operation of Law or
otherwise) either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or
obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Acquisition Sub may

 



-71-  collaterally assign any or all of their respective rights hereunder to any

sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement will be void _ab
initio_.

 

Section 10.4 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company hereby
acknowledge that Parent and the Company have previously executed a
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of April 6, 2016 (as amended, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which will continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

 

Section 10.5 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including any schedules,
annexes and exhibits hereto) and the documents and instruments and other
agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein,
including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Annex hereto, constitute the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , the Confidentiality Agreement shall not be superseded,
shall survive any termination of this Agreement and shall continue in full
force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b)
the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its
terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

Section 10.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to,
and shall not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of
_Article VII_ , (b) prior to the Effective Time, for the right of holders of
shares of the Company Common Stock and other Company Securities to pursue and
recover damages (including damages based on loss of the economic and bargain
benefits of the transaction to Company Stockholders based on the consideration
that would have otherwise been payable to holders of shares of the Company
Common Stock, the loss of market value or decline in stock price of such
Company Common Stock or otherwise (taking into consideration relevant matters,
including other combination opportunities and the time value of money)) and
other relief (including equitable relief) for any breach of this Agreement by
Parent or Acquisition Sub, whether or not this Agreement has been validly
terminated pursuant to Article IX, which right is hereby
expressly acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Acquisition Sub, (c) from and
after the Acceptance Time, the rights of holders of shares of the Company
Common Stock and other Company Securities to receive the consideration
pursuant to the Offer, as set forth in Article II, and (d) from and after the
Effective Time, the rights of holders of shares of the Company Common Stock
and other Company Securities to receive the consideration pursuant to the
Merger, as set forth in _Article III_. The rights granted pursuant to clause
(b) of this Section 10.6 shall only be enforceable on behalf of holders of
shares of the Company Common Stock and other Company Securities by the Company
in its sole and absolute discretion, as agent for such holders, it being
understood and agreed that any and all interests in such claims shall attach
to such shares of the Company Common Stock and other Company Securities and
subsequently transfer therewith and, consequently, any damages, settlements
or other amounts recovered or received by the Company with respect to such
claims (net of expenses incurred by the Company in connection therewith) may,
in the Companys sole and absolute discretion, be (A) distributed, in whole
or in part, by the Company to the holders of Company Shares or other Company
Securities of record as of any date determined by the

 



-72-  Company or (B) retained by the Company for the use and benefit of the
Company on behalf of the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock and
other Company Securities in any manner the Company deems fit. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Financing Sources and their
respective Affiliates are express third party beneficiaries of the provisions
of _Section 7.16_, _Section 9.5_,  _Section 9.6_, _Section 10.3_,
_Section 10.6_, _Section 10.8_ and _Section 10.9_.

 

Section 10.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so
as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to negotiate in good faith in an effort to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the maximum extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

Section 10.8  _Remedies_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein (including in _Section 9.4_), any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages.
Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event
of any breach or threatened breach by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent
and/or Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, of any of their respective
covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, shall be entitled to
an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement, by the other (as applicable), and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other under this Agreement. The Company, on the one hand,
and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand hereby agree not to raise
any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement by such party (or parties), and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of such party
(or parties) under this Agreement.

 

Section 10.9 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, INTERPRETED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THAT
WOULD RESULT IN THE

 



-73-  APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANY OTHER STATE OR WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO
ANOTHER JURISDICTION. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING OR ANYTHING TO THE
CONTRARY HEREIN, EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES THAT ANY DISPUTE,
ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY ARISING OUT OF, IN CONNECTION WITH
OR RELATING TO THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF AGAINST ANY
FINANCING SOURCE (EACH, A " _DEBT FINANCING DISPUTE_ ") SHALL BE GOVERNED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT GIVING
EFFECT TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF
THE LAW OF ANY OTHER STATE OR WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER
JURISDICTION. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and
only if) such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior

matter jurisdiction over the matter that is the subject of the action or
proceeding is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States
of America, the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the
district of Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating
thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i)
agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if) such court finds it
lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware
(Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter jurisdiction over the
matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding is vested exclusively
in the federal courts of the United States of America, the federal court of
the United States of America sitting in the district of Delaware, as
applicable, and any appellate court from any thereof, (ii) agrees that any
claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, if (and only if)
such court finds it lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of
the State of Delaware (Complex Commercial Division) or, if subject matter
jurisdiction over the matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding
is vested exclusively in the federal courts of the United States of America,
the federal court of the United States of America sitting in the district of
Delaware, as applicable, and any appellate court from any thereof, (iii)
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the jurisdiction or laying of
venue of any such action or proceeding in such courts and (iv) waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of such action or proceeding in such courts. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement and their
respective Affiliates agrees that it will not directly or indirectly assist or
support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim, or third-party claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including any Debt
Financing Dispute, in any forum other than the state or federal courts located
in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, New York. Each party to
this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process inside or

 



-74-  outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred to in this
_Section 10.9_, in the manner provided for notices in _Section 10.2_.
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

(b) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY A JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE MERGER AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DEBT
FINANCING DISPUTE. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
10.9_.

 

Section 10.10 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company acknowledges that each party to this
Agreement has been represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of
law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any claimed
ambiguities in this Agreement against the drafting party has no application
and is expressly waived.
