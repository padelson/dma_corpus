 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

 



 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 7, 2017 (this " **
_Agreement_** "), by and among Silicon Laboratories Inc., a corporation
incorporated in the State of Delaware (" ** _Parent_** "), Seguin Merger
Subsidiary, Inc., a corporation incorporated in the State of California (" **
_Merger Sub_** "), and Sigma Designs, Inc., a corporation incorporated in the
State of California (the " ** _Company_** "). Each of the parties to this
Agreement is individually referred to herein as a " ** _Party_** " and
collectively as the " ** _Parties_**." Capitalized terms used herein that are
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in
_Annex A_ hereto.

 



 

 ** _BACKGROUND_**

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

WHEREAS, the Parties intend to effect a merger (the " ** _Merger_** ") in
which Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company
surviving the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein;

 



 

WHEREAS, each outstanding share of common stock, without par value, of the
Company (the " ** _Company Common Stock_** " or " ** _Company Shares_** ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be
automatically converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of California,
together with all amendments and additions thereto (" ** _California Law_** ")
(other than Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)
and Dissenting Shares);

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously (a) determined
that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, and
declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement with Parent and Merger
Sub, (b) approved the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and (c)
resolved, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to
recommend the approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company;

 



 

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub have
unanimously (a) determined that it is in the best interests of each such Party
and its stockholders or shareholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into
this Agreement with the Company, and (b) approved the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions,
including the Merger;

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent intends to enter into Voting Agreements with the directors and
executive officers of the Company, and the respective Affiliates of such
directors and executive officers of the Company who are shareholders of the
Company, pursuant to which such shareholders, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, have agreed to vote or cause to be voted all of
the Company Shares beneficially owned by such shareholders for the approval of
the Merger and this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, in the event that certain conditions to the Merger are not satisfied,
the Parties instead intend to consummate the Asset Purchase; and

 



      
 

 



 

WHEREAS, the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and the Transactions
and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.

 



 

 ** _AGREEMENT_**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows:

 



 

ARTICLE I

 



 

 _The Merger_

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with California
Law, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease,
with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the Company, as the
surviving corporation in the Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the
" ** _Surviving Corporation_** "), such that immediately following the Merger,
the Surviving Corporation will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The
Merger shall have the effect provided in this Agreement and as specified in
the California Law.

 



 

1.2 _Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
the closing of the Merger (the " ** _Closing_** ") will take place at 10:00
a.m., California time, as soon as practicable (and, in any event, within two
Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder,
waiver of all conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of
all such conditions), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to
Article IX hereof or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by
the Parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub, at their sole discretion, shall not be
required to conduct the Closing during the last 14 days of any fiscal quarter
of Parent. The Closing shall be held at the offices of DLA Piper LLP (US),
2000 University Ave, Palo Alto, California, 94303, unless another place is
agreed to in writing by the Parties hereto, and the actual date of the Closing
is hereinafter referred to as the " ** _Closing Date_**."

 



 

1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Parties shall (a) cause an
agreement of merger satisfying the applicable requirements of the California
Law and otherwise in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_,
but subject to any changes as may be required by the Secretary of State of the
State of California and agreed to by Parent and the Company (the " **
_Agreement of Merger_** ") to be duly executed by the Company and Merger Sub
and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of California as soon as
practicable on the Closing Date, together with the officers certificate
required by the California Law, and (b) make any other filings, recordings or
publications required to be made by the Company or Merger Sub under the
California Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Agreement of Merger is duly filed and accepted
by the Secretary of State of the

 



      
 

 



 

State of California or on such later date and time as shall be agreed to by
the Company and Parent and specified in the Agreement of Merger (such date and
time being hereinafter referred to as the " ** _Effective Time_** ").

 



 

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
herein and in the applicable provisions of the California Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after
the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers,
franchises, licenses and authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions and duties of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

1.5 _Governing Documents_. The Company Articles shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be amended and restated so as to read in its entirety in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ and, as so amended and restated, shall be the
articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Legal Requirement. The
Company Bylaws shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated to
conform to the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and as such shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Legal
Requirement.

 



 

1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The Parties shall
take all actions necessary so that (a) the directors of Merger Sub at the
Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected
or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, and (b) the officers of Merger Sub at the Effective
Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

 _Effect of Merger on Company Securities_

 



 

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of any securities of
the Parties, subject to Section 2.1(d), each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding
Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and any
Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive
$7.05 in cash, without interest (the " ** _Merger Consideration_** "). From
and after the Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
each applicable holder of such Company Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
therefor upon the surrender of such Company Shares in accordance with Section
2.2.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, all Company
Shares owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or by any of their respective
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each issued
and outstanding share of common stock, without par value per share, of Merger
Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately, without duplication, to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time so as to
provide Parent and the holder of Company Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided, however, that
nothing in this Section 2.1(d) shall be construed to permit the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub
shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as the paying agent in connection with the Merger (the " ** _Paying
Agent_** "). The Paying Agent shall also act as the agent for the Companys
shareholders for the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares
represented thereby. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in immediately available
funds in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration
payable to all holders of Company Common Stock (including Company Common Stock
to be issued prior to the Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.4) (such
cash amount, the " ** _Paying Agent Fund_** "), in each case, for the sole
benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock. In the event the
Paying Agent Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly deposit
additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to make, and the Paying Agent shall make, delivery of the Merger
Consideration, out of the Paying Agent Fund in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event, within three Business Days thereafter), Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Paying Agent to mail (and make
available for collection by hand) to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Company Shares (the " ** _Certificates_** ") or non-certificated
Company Shares represented by book-entry (" ** _Book-Entry Shares_** ") and
whose Company Shares were

 



      
 

 



 

converted pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such Company Shares pursuant to Section 2.1. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for
cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, together with such letter of
transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II for each Company Share formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share. All such amounts shall be
mailed (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the
surrendering holder) within three Business Days following the Paying Agents
receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Share, letter of transmittal and such other documents, and the
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition precedent to payment that (A) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such payment shall have
paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Tax either has been paid or is not payable. Any other
transfer or similar Taxes incurred in connection with the Transactions shall
be paid by Parent. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with respect
to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.2, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II, without interest
thereon.

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registrations of transfers of Company
Shares on the records of the Company, other than registrations of transfers to
reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected
prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Legal Requirement. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _Termination of Paying Agent Fund; No Liability_. At any time following
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest
received with respect thereto) remaining in the Paying Agent Fund that have
not been disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the
Paying Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look
only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Legal Requirements) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the applicable Merger Consideration, payable upon due surrender of
their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in
Section 2.2(b), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent shall be liable
to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger
Consideration or other amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement.

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required by
Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such holder of a bond in such
amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to any such Certificates, the applicable Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof.

 



 

2.3 _Dissenters  Rights_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company
Shares, if any, as to which the holder thereof shall have (i) properly
demanded that the Company purchase such Company Shares for fair market value
in accordance with, and otherwise complied with, the provisions of Chapter 13
of the California Law (" ** _Chapter 13_** ") and (ii) not effectively
withdrawn or lost such holders rights to demand purchase for such Company
Shares for fair market value pursuant to Chapter 13 (each, a " ** _Dissenting
Share_** "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.1, but instead at the Effective
Time shall become entitled only to payment of the fair value of such Company
Shares determined in accordance with Chapter 13 (it being understood and
acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto
other than the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares as
determined in accordance with Chapter 13); _provided_ , _however_ , that if
any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or
lose the right to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares under
Chapter 13, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, without interest or
duplication, the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for the purchase of any Company Shares pursuant to Chapter 13, of
any withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served and
received by the Company

 



      
 

 



 

under Chapter 13, and Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to
settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

2.4 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) All options to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (each a " **
_Company Option_** "), restricted stock unit awards with respect to Company
Common Stock (each a " ** _Company RSU Award_** ") and other equity awards
(collectively, " ** _Company Equity Awards_** ") that were granted under the
Companys stock plans, including the Sigma Designs 2015 Stock Incentive Plan
(successor to and continuation of the Sigma Designs 2001 Stock Plan and the
Sigma Designs Amended and Restated 2009 Stock Incentive Plan), the CopperGate
Communications Ltd. 2003 Share Option Plan or any other equity plan, agreement
or arrangement other than the Company ESPP (as defined below) (collectively,
the " ** _Company Stock Plans_** ") prior to the Effective Time, which are
outstanding as of the Capitalization Date, are set forth in Section 2.4(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, together with the holders name, the date of
grant, the type of award, the number of Company Shares originally granted and
number of outstanding shares subject to the Company Equity Award, the vesting
schedule, any expiration date, and any per Company Share exercise price or
purchase price.

 



 

(b) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will assume any Company
Option or substitute for a Company Option any option, unit award, restricted
share or other rights to acquire shares of the capital stock of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the vesting of
each Company Option then outstanding and held by an employee or other service
provider whose employment or service relationship with the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company has not terminated shall be accelerated in full. At
the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled by
virtue of the Merger without any action on the part of the holder thereof in
consideration for the right to receive a cash payment (the " ** _Company
Option Consideration_** "), if any (without interest and less applicable
withholding Taxes) with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the number
of vested shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including as a result of accelerated
vesting), and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of
doubt, each Company Stock Option that has an exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration
shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor. The
Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary thereof shall pay the Company Option
Consideration to which a former holder of a Company Option who is an employee
or former employee of the Company or such Subsidiary is entitled and for which
Tax withholding is required through the employee payroll system of the Company
or such Subsidiary no later than its next regularly scheduled payroll date
occurring at least five Business Days following the Effective Time. Each such
payment of Company Option Consideration to a former holder of a Company Option
for

 



      
 

 



 

which Tax withholding is not required shall be paid to such holder in cash by
the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary thereof.

 



 

(c) Except as provided by Section 2.4(d), neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation will assume any Company RSU Award or substitute for a Company RSU
Award any option, unit award, restricted share or other rights to acquire
shares of the capital stock of Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Except as
provided by Section 2.4(d), at the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested
or unvested, shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger without any action on
the part of the holder thereof in consideration for the right to receive a
cash payment (the " ** _Company RSU Consideration_** ") with respect thereto
(without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes) equal to the product
of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock remaining subject to and
not previously issued in settlement of such Company RSU Award as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration.
Payment of the Company RSU Consideration shall be made in pro rata
installments in accordance with the time-based vesting schedule to which the
shares of Company Common Stock remaining subject to such Company RSU Award
were subject immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the continued
employment or other service relationship of the former holder of such Company
RSU on the applicable post-Effective Time vesting date (each, an " ** _RSU
Vesting Date_** "); provided that to the extent that any such Company RSU
Award constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A
of the Code, the Company RSU Consideration payable with respect to such
Company RSU Award shall be paid in accordance with the applicable Company RSU
Awards terms and conditions at the earliest time permitted under the terms of
such award that will not result in the application of a Tax or penalty under
Section 409A of the Code. The Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary thereof
shall pay the Company RSU Consideration to which a former holder of a Company
RSU Award who is an employee or former employee of the Company or such
Subsidiary is entitled and for which Tax withholding is required through the
employee payroll system of the Company or such Subsidiary no later than its
next regularly scheduled payroll date occurring after each applicable RSU
Vesting Date. Each such payment of Company RSU Consideration to a former
holder of a Company RSU Award for which Tax withholding is not required shall
be paid to such holder in cash by the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary
thereof as soon as practicable after each applicable RSU Vesting Date.

 



 

(d) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, and whose
holder remains an employee of the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary
thereof immediately after the Effective Time and is employed in Denmark,
Singapore or the United States, shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger
without any action on the part of the holder thereof in consideration for the
right to receive from Parent immediately after the Effective Time pursuant to
Parents 2009 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated as of the
Effective Time, a restricted stock unit award issued by Parent for that number
of restricted stock units equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock remaining subject to and not previously issued in
settlement of such Company RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (ii) the RSU Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole
share). Each such restricted stock unit award issued by Parent pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall be subject to substantially the same vesting schedule
as was applicable under the Company RSU Award cancelled in exchange therefor,
including any provision for accelerated vesting.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) As of the Effective Time, all Company Stock Plans will be terminated, and
no further Company Options, Company RSU Awards or other rights with respect to
Company Shares will be granted thereunder.

 



 

(f) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if
applicable, any committee thereof administering the Sigma Designs 2015
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the " ** _Company ESPP_** ")) shall
adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary actions to provide that
(i) no new Offering or Offering Period (as defined by the Company ESPP) shall
be commenced under the Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement; (ii)
participation in the Company ESPP shall be limited to those employees who are
participants on the date of this Agreement; (iii) no participant in the
Company ESPP may increase the percentage amount of his or her payroll
deduction election from that in effect under the Company ESPP on the date of
this Agreement; (iv) each Offering Period in effect on the date of this
Agreement shall terminate effective upon the earlier of the first purchase
date following the date of this Agreement and the third trading day occurring
before the Effective Time, but subsequent to the exercise of options on such
purchase date (in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP and the
limitations under the Company ESPP regarding the maximum number and value of
shares of Company Common Stock a participant may purchase in such Offering
Period); and (v) immediately prior to, and subject to the occurrence of the
Effective Time, the Company ESPP shall terminate.

 



 

(g) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions
necessary to effect the provisions set forth in this Section 2.4, including
without limitation any necessary amendments to any Contracts or other
instruments and the delivery of all required notice, as applicable. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall send a notice to all holders of
outstanding Company Equity Awards, in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent,
which notice shall (i) notify such holders of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) describe the treatment of outstanding Company Equity
Awards pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) seek the acknowledgement and
consent of such holders to the cancellation of outstanding Company Equity
Awards as contemplated by this Agreement. Such notification shall not contain
any untrue statement of material fact or omit any material statement necessary
in order to make the statements therein not misleading.

 



 

2.5 _Withholding_. Each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Shares and from any payments under Section 2.4 such amounts
as Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Legal Requirement. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

registered public accounting firm has identified or been made aware of
"significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as defined by the Public
Company Account Oversight Board) in the design or operation of the Companys
internal controls and procedures which are reasonably likely to adversely

material Permits issued to the Company and its Subsidiaries have previously
been delivered to, or made available to, Parent. The Company, its Subsidiaries
and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives
and agents (in each case, in their capacity as such and to the extent required
to comply with the terms of such Permits) have complied with all terms of such

terms set forth in Article IX of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Parents Representatives
reasonable access, at reasonable times during normal operating hours, upon
reasonable prior written notice and in a manner as shall not unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of the Company or any Subsidiary
thereof, to the officers, employees, accountants, properties, offices and
other Facilities and to all books, records, Contracts and other assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent such other information concerning
the business and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may
reasonably request from time to time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to
or disclose information where such access or disclosure would be reasonably
likely to jeopardize the protection of attorney-client privilege, or
contravene any Legal Requirement or contractual restraint enforceable upon the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (it being agreed that the Parties shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a
manner that would not result in such jeopardy or contravention). No
investigation shall affect the Companys representations and warranties
contained herein, or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to
Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms set forth in Article IX of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms set forth therein. The terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information
obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in connection with any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this Section
5.2.

 



 

5.3 _Insurance_. Through the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall use reasonable best efforts consistent with past practices to maintain
insurance policies existing as of the date of this Agreement providing
insurance coverage for the businesses in which the Company and its
Subsidiaries are engaged and the assets and properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries of the kinds, in the amounts and against the risks as are
reasonable best for such businesses and risks covered and for the geographic
areas where the Company and its Subsidiaries engage in such businesses.

 



      
 

 



 

5.4 _Notification of Certain Events_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify
the other party hereto of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event
that would be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to
effect the Merger, or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not
to be satisfied or (b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any
party to effect the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement not to be satisfied; provided, however, that no such notification
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of such
party set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of the other party
to consummate the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereto.

 



 

5.5 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents_.

 



 

(a) Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all material
Consents that are or become necessary for its execution and delivery of, and
the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party and will reasonably cooperate
with the other Party in promptly seeking to obtain all such Consents,
including, but not limited to any matters involving Government Antitrust
Entities.

 



 

(b) Each Party shall give promptly such notices to third parties and use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain such third party Consents as are required to
consummate the Transactions.

 



 

(c) Each Party shall cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to assist
any other Party in giving such notices and obtaining such Consents as are
required to consummate the Transactions.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable to cause the
conditions to the obligations of the other parties hereunder to be satisfied
and to consummate the Transactions, including making all necessary filings
(including filings under the HSR Act) with any Government Antitrust Entity,
and obtaining all necessary waivers, clearances, Consents and approvals from,
and taking all steps to avoid any Action or proceeding by, any Government
Antitrust Entity.

 



 

(e) To the extent required, each Party will use its commercially reasonable
best efforts to promptly prepare and file, or cause to be promptly prepared
and filed, with the appropriate Government Antitrust Entity not later than ten
Business Days after the date of this Agreement (unless otherwise mutually
agreed among the Parties) any notification with respect to the Transactions
that may be required pursuant to the HSR Act in which each requests early
termination of the waiting period thereunder. Each Party shall respond, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, to all information requests from a
Government Antitrust Entity under the HSR Act, and shall reasonably cooperate
with the other Parties in responding to any such request. Each Party will
furnish to the other (or its outside counsel) such information and

 



      
 

 



 

assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the foregoing;
provided, however, that one Party disclosing information to another may do so
on the condition that it be shared only with the receiving Partys outside
counsel who, in turn, agrees to treat such information as confidential and not
disclose it to any third-parties without the advance written consent of the
party who disclosed the information. Each Party will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve favorably any review or consideration of the
antitrust aspects of the Transactions by any Government Antitrust Entity with
jurisdiction over the enforcement of any applicable Antitrust Legal
Requirements. Each of the Parties shall promptly inform the other Parties of
any substantive communication to or from the Federal Trade Commission (" **
_FTC_** "), the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice
(" ** _DOJ_** "), or any other Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions.
Each of the Parties will consult and cooperate with one another in advance,
and will consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with
any communication, analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion, proposal, or other submission made to a Government
Antitrust Entity in connection with any investigation or proceeding conducted
under either (i) the HSR Act; or (ii) any foreign competition statute enforced
by any Government Antitrust Entity. Except as may be prohibited by any
Government Antitrust Entity, in connection with any investigation or
proceeding under the HSR Act concerning the Transactions, each of the Parties
shall permit Representatives of the other Parties (which may, as appropriate,
be limited to outside counsel), to be present and participate in all meetings,
conferences, or other communications with a Government Antitrust Entity
relating to any such proceeding or investigation.

 



 

(f) In furtherance and not in limitation of the efforts referred to above in
this Section 5.5, if any objections are asserted with respect to the
Transactions under the HSR Act, or if any Action, suit or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Entity or any third party challenging the Transactions or that
would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions, each Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve any such objections or actions, suits or
proceedings so as to permit the consummation of the Transactions as
expeditiously as possible.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 5.5, none of Parent or its
Affiliates shall be obligated to: (i) offer, negotiate, commit to or effect,
by consent decree, hold separate order, trust or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, license or other disposition of any material portion of the
capital stock, assets, rights, products or businesses of Parent, the Company,
or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates; (ii) agree to any material
restrictions on the activities of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company); (iii) waive any material rights;
(iv) defend, commence or prosecute any Action; or (v) take any other action to
prevent, effect the dissolution of, vacate, or lift any decree, order,
judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit
or proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying
the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

5.6 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) From and after this Agreement Date, until the earlier of the Effective
Time and the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article
IX, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and it
shall direct their respective Representatives not

 



      
 

 



 

to, directly or indirectly through another Person, solicit, initiate or
knowingly take any action to facilitate or encourage any Acquisition Proposal
or proposal or inquiry that would be reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or, subject to Section 5.6(b), (i) conduct or engage in
any discussions or negotiations with, disclose any non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist,
participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by, any third party that is
seeking to make, or has made, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into any
agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other Contract relating to any Acquisition Proposal or enter into
any agreement or agreement in principle requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Transactions or breach its obligations
under this Agreement, or (iii) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing, provided however, nothing in this Section 5.6(a) shall prohibit the
Company or its Representatives from contacting in writing any Person or group
of Persons who make, following the date of this Agreement, a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal, for the sole purpose of clarifying the terms and
conditions thereof so as to determine whether such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal,
and any such actions shall not be a breach of this Section 5.6(a). The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and shall direct its Representatives
to immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and shall not authorize or
knowingly permit any of its or their Representatives to continue, any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations, with any third party
conducted with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause any such third party (or its agents or
advisors) in possession of non-public information in respect of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company or
its Subsidiaries to return or destroy (and confirm destruction of) all such
information.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.6 to the contrary, at any time
prior to the Company Shareholder Approval, in response to an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement, and
not resulting from an intentional or material breach of Section 5.6(a), that
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside counsel) constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, the Company may, upon a good faith
determination by the Company Board (after consultation with its outside
counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Legal Requirements: (A) furnish information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons Representatives); provided, however,
that the Company and such Person enter into a customary confidentiality
agreement containing terms no less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and containing additional
provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply with the terms of this
Section 5.6 (a copy of which confidentiality agreement shall be promptly and
in any event with 24 hours provided for informational purposes only to
Parent); provided, further, that any material non-public information
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries provided or made available
to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal shall, to the extent not
previously provided to Merger Sub or Parent, be provided or made available to
Merger Sub or Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable after it is
provided to such Person making such Acquisition

 



       
 

 



 

Proposal; and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such
Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(c) The Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing, in no event later
than 24 hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and shall indicate the
identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, of the terms and
conditions of any proposal or offer, the nature of any inquiries or contacts,
and all material written materials relating to such Acquisition Proposal and
thereafter shall keep Parent informed of all material developments affecting
the status and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to
make, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
amend or modify the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, endorse, adopt
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal, (iii) fail to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iv) fail to recommend against
acceptance of any tender offer or exchange offer for the Company Common Stock
within six Business Days after the commencement of such offer, (v) fail to
issue a press release reaffirming the Company Board Recommendation after
receipt of any publicly announced Acquisition Proposal within five Business
Days following Parents written request to issue such press release (
_provided_ that Parent shall not be entitled to request such reaffirmation
more than one time, unless such Acquisition Proposal is amended, after which,
the Company Board shall provide a reaffirmation for each such amendment in
accordance with this Section 5.6(d)), or (vi) resolve or agree to take any of
the foregoing actions (each such foregoing action or failure to act in clauses
(i) through (vi) being referred to as a " ** _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_** "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the determination (but not the
adoption, approval, recommendation or endorsement) by the Company Board that
an Acquisition Proposal is or would be reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal shall not be deemed a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change". The
Company Board may, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval and subject to the Companys compliance with Section 5.6(e) of this
Agreement, take any of the following actions: (A) effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
if the Company Board concludes in good faith (i) after consultation with the
Companys financial advisor, that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and (ii) after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Legal Requirements; or (B) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Legal Requirements.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 5.6(d), the
Company shall not be entitled to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to Section 5.6(d) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.4
in response to a Superior Proposal unless: (A) the Company shall have first
provided prompt prior written notice, and in any event at least five Business
Days prior to making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (the " ** _Notice
Period_** ") to Parent of its intention to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (a " ** _Recommendation Change Notice_** "), which
notice shall contain a description of the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal, including the most

 



      
 

 



 

current version of the agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (which
description and summary shall be updated on a prompt basis) in the form to be
entered into and the identity of the third party making the Superior Proposal
or, if the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board is an
Intervening Event, a description of the events, facts and circumstances giving
rise to such Intervening Event and the reason for the Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (it being understood and agreed that the delivery of
such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change); (B) the Company shall, and shall cause its financial
advisor and legal counsel to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent
in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal, or in the case of an Intervening Event, to cause such Intervening
Event to no longer form the basis for the Company Board to effect a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, if Parent, in its discretion, proposes to make
such adjustments (it being understood and agreed (x) that in the event that,
after commencement of the Notice Period, there is any material revision to the
terms of a Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, the Notice
Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least three
Business Days remain in the Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company
notifies Parent of any such material revision and (y) that there may be
multiple extensions of the Notice Period); and (C) Parent does not make,
within the Notice Period, a binding written proposal that is determined by the
Company Board (after consultation the Companys outside counsel, and in the
case of a Superior Proposal, the Companys financial advisor), to cause such
Intervening Event to no longer form the basis for the Company Board to effect
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the offer previously
constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal,
as the case may be.

 



 

(f) The Company shall keep confidential any proposals made by Parent to revise
the terms of this Agreement, other than in the event of any amendment to this
Agreement or to the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements to be
disclosed.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders
a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party
pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
"stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys stockholders pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if the Company Board has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the
directors fiduciary duties under any Legal Requirement; _provided_ that, in
each case, any Company Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in
accordance with this Section 5.6; and _provided_ further that any such
statement or disclosure shall constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change unless such statement or disclosure is accompanied by an express,
unequivocal affirmation of the Company Board Recommendation.

 



 

(h) The Company agrees that any action taken by any individual officer,
director, financial advisor, banker, investment banker or, at the direction of
the Company, by any other Company Representative that, if taken by the
Company, would constitute an intentional or material breach of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.6 shall be deemed to be an
intentional or material breach (as applicable) of this Section 5.6 by the
Company.

 



      
 

 



 

5.7 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to prepare, within 16
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, in consultation with Parent,
and cause to be filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form.
The Proxy Statement will include, among other items set forth in Section
5.8(a) below, a proposal of the approval of the Merger (but not the Asset
Purchase). The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to prepare, within 20
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, in consultation with Parent,
and cause to be filed with the SEC in preliminary form a Proxy Statement which
will include, among other items set forth in Section 5.8(a) below, a proposal
of the approval of the Asset Purchase (but not the Merger) (such preliminary
Proxy Statement, the " ** _Asset Proxy Statement_** ", but also a " ** _Proxy
Statement_** "). Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information
concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its shares to the other
and provide such other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection
with the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no responsibility with
respect to information or statements made or incorporated by reference in the
Proxy Statement which were based on information supplied by or on behalf of
Parent.

 



 

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the
Proxy Statement, and shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof,
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received by the Company from the
SEC and advise Parent of any material oral comments with respect to the Proxy
Statement received from the SEC. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement. Parent shall and shall cause its
Representatives to assist and cooperate with the Company and its
Representatives in the resolution of any such comments from the SEC related
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the preliminary or
definitive draft of the Proxy Statement with the SEC, mailing the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or responding to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response in
advance (including the proposed final version of such document or response),
provided that such period shall not exceed five Business Days, and the Company
shall consider in good faith any comments provided by Parent or any of its
Representatives with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, respectively, or any of
their respective Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent
which, in the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, respectively,
should be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy
Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Parties, and the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the
prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment of, or supplement to,
the Proxy Statement and, to the extent required by Legal Requirement, in
disseminating the

 



      
 

 



 

information contained in such amendment or supplement to shareholders of the
Company. Nothing in this Section 5.7(c) shall limit the obligations of any
Party under Section 5.7(b).

 



 

(d) For purposes of this Section 5.7, any information concerning or related to
the Company, its Affiliates or the Company Shareholder Meeting will be deemed
to have been provided by the Company, and any information concerning or
related to Parent or its Affiliates will be deemed to have been provided by
Parent.

 



 

5.8 _Company Shareholder Meeting_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts, in accordance with applicable
Legal Requirement and the Company Articles and Company Bylaws, to establish a
record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Shareholder Meeting. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its shareholders as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within four Business Days) following the later
of (i) the resolution of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC
with respect to the preliminary Proxy Statement, and (ii) the expiration of
the ten day waiting period provided in Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act. The Company shall, through the Company Board of Directors,
recommend to its shareholders that they give the Company Shareholder Approval,
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and solicit and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, except in
each case to the extent that the Company Board of Directors shall have made a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 5.6.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.8, the Company may
postpone, recess or adjourn the Company Shareholder Meeting without the prior
written consent of Parent (but after consultation with Parent) (i) to the
extent required by any Legal Requirement or any court of competent
jurisdiction, (ii) if as of the time for which the Company Shareholder Meeting
is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company Shares represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
Shareholder Meeting or to the extent that at such time the Company has not
received proxies sufficient to allow the receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval at the Company Shareholder Meeting, (iii) to allow time for the
filing and dissemination of, and a sufficient period for evaluation by the
Companys shareholders of, any supplemental or amended disclosure document to
the extent that the Companys Board of Directors has determined in good faith
(after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel) is necessary or
required under any applicable Legal Requirement or (iv) the Company Board has
effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by Section 5.6.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Determination Date
occurs, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the
Asset Proxy Statement to be mailed to its shareholders as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within two Business Days) following the later of
(i) the resolution of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC with
respect to the preliminary Asset Proxy Statement, and (ii) the expiration of
the ten day waiting period provided in Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, and (ii) in accordance with applicable Legal Requirement and the
Company Articles and Company Bylaws, to establish a record date for, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholder Meeting to vote
on the matters set forth in the Asset Proxy Statement.

 



      
 

 



 

Without the prior written consent of Parent, the approval of this Agreement,
the Merger or the Asset Purchase (in accordance with Section 5.7(a) above),
the adjournment of the Company Shareholder Meeting, as necessary, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes in favor of approval of
this Agreement, and the advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the
Exchange Act shall be the only matters (other than matters of procedure and
matters required by applicable Legal Requirement to be voted on by the
Companys shareholders in connection with the approval of this Agreement) that
the Company shall propose to be acted on by the shareholders of the Company at
the Company Shareholder Meeting. Once the Company has established a record
date for the Company Shareholder Meeting, the Company shall not change such
record date or establish a different record date for the Company Shareholder
Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, unless, following
consultation with Parent, required to do so by applicable Legal Requirements
(but the Company shall not be entitled to claim that the Company Boards
fiduciary duties require it to establish a new record date) or the Company
Articles or Company Bylaws.

 



 

(b) The Company will use reasonable best efforts to hold the Company
Shareholder Meeting as soon as practicable after the Proxy Statement is mailed
to the Companys shareholders.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement
has been previously terminated in full compliance with Article IX, the Company
agrees that (i) its obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold
the Company Shareholder Meeting shall not be affected by any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and (ii) its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.8
shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure
or communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a
Superior Proposal). Unless this Agreement is terminated in full compliance
with Article IX, the Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of
the shareholders of the Company any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a
Superior Proposal) prior to the vote of the shareholders of the Company with
respect to the Merger at the Company Shareholder Meeting.

 



 

5.9 _Disposition of Company Equity Awards_. The Company Board, or a committee
thereof consisting of Non-Employee Directors (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt resolutions in
advance of the Effective Time providing that, in connection with the
Transactions, the disposition of any Company Common Stock or Company Equity
Awards and/or receipt of Parent Stock by Exchange Act Section 16 reporting
persons is intended to be exempt from Exchange Act Section 16(b) liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act.

 



 

5.10 _Shareholder Litigation_. Prior to the earlier of the Effective Time or
the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX and subject
to applicable Legal Requirement: (a) the Company shall promptly advise Parent
in writing of any shareholder litigation against the Company or its directors
relating to this Agreement, the Transactions or the Merger and shall keep
Parent informed regarding any such shareholder litigation; and (b) the Company
shall give Parent reasonable opportunity, at Parents sole cost and expense,
to participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in the defense
of any action, claim, suit or proceeding against the Company or its directors
or officers relating to this Agreement, the Transactions or the Merger, and no
settlement of such shareholder litigation in excess of the

 



      
 

 



 

amount covered by the Company Insurance Policies (excluding payment of the
applicable policy deductible) will be agreed to or offered without the prior
written consent of Parent; provided, that any settlement within the amount
covered by the Company Insurance Policies (including payment of the applicable
policy deductible) may be agreed to and offered by the Company or its
directors and officers without the prior consent of Parent. Each of the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
cooperate in the defense or negotiation or settlement of any litigation
contemplated by this Section 5.10. The parties acknowledge that this Section
5.10 in no way limits the parties obligations under Section 5.4.

 



 

5.11 _401(k) Plans_. Unless otherwise requested in writing by Parent no later
than ten days prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or the
appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as is necessary to terminate any Company Benefit Plan intended to
qualify as a qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of
the Code (collectively, the " ** _Company 401(k) Plans"_**), effective no
later than the day immediately prior to the Effective Time and, effective as
of such date, no employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have
any right thereafter to contribute any amounts to the Company 401(k) Plans.
The Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment, in advance of any such adoption or corporate action, on any such
resolutions or corporation actions.

 



 

5.12 _Resignations_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause any
director and any officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries identified
by Parent to execute and deliver a letter effectuating his or her resignation
as a director or officer (but not as an employee) of such entity effective as
of the Effective Time. At the request of Parent, the Company will use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent to effect the replacement of
any such directors and officers selected by Parent at the Effective Time.

 



 

5.13 _Disposition_. During the period from the date of this Agreement and
continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms set forth in Article IX of this Agreement or the
Closing Date, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter
into an agreement to effectuate the sale of the Companys G.hn/HPNA business
(the " ** _Divestiture_** "), on the terms approved by Parent; provided that
the foregoing shall not reduce or eliminate the Companys obligations pursuant
to Section 5.1(f).

_Indemnified Party_** ") as provided in the Company Articles and Company
Bylaws or similar governing documents of the Companys Subsidiaries, in each
case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other
Contracts in effect on the date of this Agreement and disclosed in Section
6.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " ** _Indemnification
Contracts_** ") for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
(including acts or omissions occurring in connection with this Agreement and
the consummation of the Merger) shall be honored by the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries and shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms. Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in all
respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any and
such Indemnification Contracts.

under applicable Legal Requirement, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and
any successor to the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or its successor to indemnify, defend and hold harmless

expenses, Judgments and fines arising directly or indirectly, in whole or in
part out of actions or omissions in their capacity as such occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the Transactions),
and shall advance and/or reimburse each Indemnified Party for any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
with investigating or defending any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
fees, expenses, Judgments and fines as the same are incurred, subject to the
Surviving Corporations receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Party to
repay such legal and other fees and expenses paid in advance if it is
ultimately determined in a final and non-appealable Judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified under applicable Legal Requirement; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation will not be liable for any settlement effected without
the Surviving Corporations prior written Consent.

 



 

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an aggregate
period of not less than six years from the Effective Time, the Companys
current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " **
_D andO Insurance_**") that is no less favorable than the Companys existing
policy as of the date of this Agreement or, if insurance coverage that is no
less favorable is unavailable, the best available coverage; provided, however,
that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an aggregate
premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
paid prior to the date of this Agreement or, if less, the cost of a policy
providing coverage on the same terms as the Companys existing policy as of
the date of this Agreement; provided, further, that the Company may prior to
the Effective Time substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage with
respect to DandO Insurance with an aggregate cost not in excess of 300% of the

that the Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the

consideration to any comments made by Parent with respect thereto.

 



 

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.2 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to
whom this Section 6.2 applies without the Consent of such affected Indemnified
Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this
Section 6.2 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 6.2,
each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.2).

 



 

(e) The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be
exclusive of any other rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Legal Requirement, Contract or otherwise. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or
impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its
officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this Section 6.2 is not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

to any release, announcement or disclosure made or proposed to be made by any
Party with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or Superior Proposal.

(c) if this Agreement has been submitted to the shareholders of the Company
for approval and authorization at a duly convened Company Shareholder Meeting
and the Company Shareholder Approval shall not have been obtained at such
meeting (including any adjournment or postponement thereof) provided, however,
that: (A) a Party shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 9.2(c) if the failure of such Company Shareholder Approval to

respect any covenant in this Agreement required to be performed by such Party
at or prior to the Effective Time or the material breach of such Partys

Party specifying with particularity the reason for

 



      
 

 



 

such termination, and any such termination in accordance with this Section 9.5
shall be effective immediately upon delivery of such written notice to the
other Parties; provided, however, that any purported termination of this
Agreement by the Company pursuant to (i) Section 9.2(c) shall be effective

except (i) with respect to Section 5.2(b), this Section 9.5, Section 9.6 and
Article X (and any related definitions contained in any such Sections or
Article X), which shall remain in full force and effect and (ii) a Party shall
remain liable for any liabilities or damages caused by such Party to the
extent such liabilities or damages were the result of fraud or the willful and
material breach of this Agreement by such Party.

 



 

9.6 _Fees and Expenses Following Termination_.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.3(a),
or (ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 9.4(a), or (iii) by the Company (if
such termination by the Company is at a time when Parent would have been
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.2(c)) or Parent
pursuant to Section 9.2(c) if any of the events set forth in Section 9.3(a)
occurred prior to the duly convened Company Shareholder Meeting, then the
Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds),
within two Business Days after such termination, the Termination Fee.

 



 

(b) Except as set forth in the immediately following sentence, if (i) after
the date of this Agreement, but prior to the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, (x) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly announced, (y) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been otherwise made
known to the Company Board or the Companys executive officers or (z) any
person shall have publicly announced or otherwise made known to the Company
Board or the Companys executive officers, an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement,
(ii) thereafter, this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.2(a) or
Section 9.2(c) hereof and (iii) within twelve months following the date of
such termination of this Agreement the Company shall have entered into a
definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal which is
ultimately consummated, or any Acquisition Proposal shall have been
consummated, then in any such event the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire
transfer of immediately available funds), no later than two Business Days
following the consummation of such transaction, the Termination Fee, (it being
understood solely for the purpose of clause (iii) of this sentence, all
references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to 15% shall be deemed to
be references to "more than 50%" instead). Notwithstanding the immediately
foregoing sentence, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.3(b)
hereof (or Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.2(c) hereof at a time when Parent would
have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3(b)
hereof) and within twelve months following the date of such termination of
this Agreement the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal which is ultimately consummated, or any
Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated, then in any such event the
Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds),
no

 



      
 

 



 

later than two Business Days following the consummation of such transaction,
the Termination Fee (it being understood for all purposes of this sentence,
all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to 15% shall be
deemed to be references to "more than 50%" instead).

 



 

(c) Subject to Section 10.9, the Parties agree that the payment of the
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy available to
Parent and Merger Sub with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby in the event any such payment becomes due and payable,
and, upon payment of the Termination Fee by the Company, the Company, the
Companys Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers,
employees, shareholders and Representatives shall have no further liability to
Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement. Each of the Parties hereto
acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not intended to be a penalty but is
rather liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent
in the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is due and payable, for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall the
Company be obligated to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

reasonable and documented costs and expenses of Parent (including its
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred or accrued in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this
Section 9.6 at the prime lending rate prevailing during such period as

receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, by written agreement signed by
each of the Parties hereto; provided, however, that following the receipt of
the Company Shareholder Approval, there shall be no amendment or supplement to
the provisions of this Agreement which by Legal Requirement or in accordance
with the rules of any relevant self-regulatory organization would require
further approval by the holders of the Company Shares without such approval.

 



 

9.8 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent or
Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, may (a) extend

of such rights.
