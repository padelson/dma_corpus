 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

  



  

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Plan of Merger_ ") is made as of
January 5, 2015, by and between Chemical Financial Corporation, a Michigan
corporation (" _Purchaser_ "), and Lake Michigan Financial Corporation, a
Michigan corporation (" _Company_ ").

  

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

  

1.  The respective Boards of Directors of each of Company and Purchaser have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective corporations and shareholders that Company merge with and into Purchaser (the " _Merger_ ") in accordance with the terms of this Plan of Merger, the Michigan Business Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ "), and any other applicable Law;

  

2.  The Company Board of Directors has, in light of and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Plan of Merger, resolved to adopt this Plan of Merger, to authorize the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by it and to recommend approval by the Company Shareholders of this Plan of Merger;

  

3.  The Purchaser Board of Directors has, in light of and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Plan of Merger, resolved to adopt this Plan of Merger and to authorize the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by it;

  

4.  For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Plan of Merger is intended to be and is adopted as a "Plan of Reorganization" for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

  

5.  All of the members of the Company Board of Directors have executed and delivered to Purchaser a voting agreement substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit A_.

  

In consideration of the representations, warranties, mutual covenants and
agreements contained in this Plan of Merger, Company and Purchaser agree as
follows:

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER

  

1.1   _Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan of
Merger, at the Effective Time, Company shall be merged with and into Purchaser
and the separate corporate existence of Company shall cease. Company and
Purchaser are each sometimes referred to as a " _Constituent Corporation_
" prior to the Merger. At the Effective Time, the Constituent Corporations
shall become a single corporation, which corporation shall be Purchaser (the
" _Surviving Corporation_ "). The effect of the Merger upon each of the
Constituent Corporations and the Surviving Corporation shall be as provided
in the MBCA with respect to the merger of corporations. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject to the MBCA, at the Effective Time:
(a) all the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, licenses, and interests
in and to every type of property (whether real, personal, or mixed) of Company
and Purchaser, shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, (b) all choses in
action of Company and Purchaser shall continue

   



* * * 

--- 

 


--- 

    

unaffected and uninterrupted by the Merger and shall accrue to the Surviving
Corporation, and (c) all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and
Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

1.2   _The Closing_. Company and Purchaser shall consummate the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") (a) at the offices of Warner Norcross and Judd LLP,
111 Lyon Street, NW, Suite 900, Grand Rapids, Michigan 49503, at 10:00 a.m.,
local time, on a date to be agreed upon by Company and Purchaser upon five
Business Days\' written notice (or, at the election of Purchaser and with the
consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, on
the last Business Day of the month in which the Closing would occur in
accordance with this _Section 1.2_ ) after the last of the conditions to
Closing contained in _Article VI_ (other than any conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) is satisfied or waived in
accordance with this Plan of Merger, or (b) at such other place and time or
on such other date as Company and Purchaser may mutually determine (the date
on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_
"). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Purchaser may, at its
option, delay the Closing to the last Business Day of the month following the
month in which the date first specified by Company pursuant to this section
occurs if such delay is considered by Purchaser to be necessary to prevent the
Closing from occurring during a month in which a calendar quarter ends.
Scheduling or commencing the Closing shall not, however, constitute a waiver
of the respective conditions precedent of the parties set forth in _Article
VI_.

  

1.3   _Effective Time of Merger_. Upon completion of the Closing,
Company and Purchaser shall each promptly execute and file a certificate of
merger as required by the MBCA to effect the Merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ "). No party shall take any action to revoke the Certificate of
Merger after its filing without the written consent of the other party. The "
_Effective Time_ " of the Merger shall be the time and date when the Merger
becomes effective as set forth in the Certificate of Merger.

  

1.4   _Additional Actions_. At any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation may determine that deeds, assignments, or assurances
or any other acts are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect, or confirm, of
record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its rights, title, or
interest in, to, or under any of the rights, properties, or assets of Company
and Purchaser acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a
result of, or in connection with, the Merger, or to otherwise carry out the
purposes of this Plan of Merger. Company and Purchaser grant to the Surviving
Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all such
deeds, assignments, and assurances and to do all acts necessary, proper, or
convenient to accomplish this purpose. This irrevocable power of attorney
shall only be operative following the Effective Time and at such time the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be fully authorized
in the name of Company and Purchaser to take any and all such actions
contemplated by this Plan of Merger.

  

1.5   _Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall have the following attributes until they are subsequently
changed in the manner provided by Law:

  

1.5.1   _Name_. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
"Chemical Financial Corporation."

  

   

2

* * * 

--- 

 


--- 

    

1.5.2   _Articles of Incorporation_. The articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be the articles of
incorporation of Purchaser as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, without change.

  

1.5.3   _Bylaws_. The bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
be the bylaws of Purchaser as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, without change.

  

1.5.4   _Officers_. The officers of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the officers of Purchaser immediately before the Effective Time.

  

1.5.5   _Directors_. The directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the directors of Purchaser immediately before the Effective Time.

  

1.6   _Reservation of Right to Revise Structure._ At Purchaser\'s
election, the Merger may alternatively be structured so that (a) Company is
merged with and into any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Purchaser or (b) any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Purchaser
is merged with and into Company; _provided, however_ , that no such change
shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration or
the treatment of the holders of Company Common Stock, (ii) prevent the parties
from obtaining the opinions of counsel referred to in _Section 6.2.5_ and
_Section 6.3.5_ or otherwise cause the transaction to fail to qualify for the
Intended Tax Treatment, or (iii) materially impede or delay consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger. In the event of such an
election, the parties agree to execute an appropriate amendment to this Plan
of Merger (to the extent such amendment only changes the method of effecting
the business combination and does not substantively affect this Plan of Merger
or the rights and obligations of the parties or their respective
shareholders) in order to reflect such election.

  

ARTICLE II 
 EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  

2.1   _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Company, Purchaser or any
other Person:

  

2.1.1   _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each share of Company
Common Stock that is owned by Company (or by any of its wholly-
owned Subsidiaries) or Purchaser (or by any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries)
(collectively, the " _Excluded Shares,_ "  _provided_ , _however_ , that
Excluded Shares shall not include Trust Account Shares or DPC Shares as
defined in this Plan of Merger) immediately before the Effective Time will
automatically be canceled and cease to exist without delivery of any
consideration in exchange for or in respect of any Excluded Share.

  

2.1.2   _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than the Excluded Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive (a) $16.64 in cash (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), and (b)
1.326 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Purchaser Common Stock (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
whereupon such shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding
and all rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock will cease

   

3

--- 

    

to exist, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.9_ , and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.4_ , upon
surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in accordance with _Section
2.3_. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any payment to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
II_.

  

2.1.3   _Purchaser Common Stock Remains Outstanding_. Each share
of Purchaser Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding and represent one share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

2.2  Stock Plans.

  

2.2.1  Company and Purchaser shall take all requisite action so
that, as of the Effective Time, each right of any kind, contingent or
accrued, to receive Company Common Stock or benefits measured in whole or in
part by the value of a number of shares of Company Common Stock under the
Company Stock Plans (each, an " _Award_ "), whether vested or unvested, that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
represent an Award with respect to Company Common Stock, and shall be
converted by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder of that Award, into an award (as converted, a " _Converted Stock-Based
Award_ ") with respect to a number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal
to the product of (a) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Award, multiplied by (b) the sum of (i) the Exchange
Ratio and (ii) the Cash Consideration divided by $29.29 (the " _Converted
Stock-Based Award Ratio_ "). As of the Effective Time, Purchaser will assume
the Company Stock Plans.

  

2.2.2  All Converted Stock-Based Awards shall continue to have,
and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Company
Stock Plans (or any other agreement to which such Converted Stock-Based Award
was subject immediately prior to the Effective Time), except as otherwise
provided in this Plan of Merger. The exercise or strike price (if any) per
share of Purchaser Common Stock applicable to any Converted Stock-Based Award
shall be equal to (a) the per share exercise price of such Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided by (b) the Converted Stock-Based Award
Ratio. Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall make such amendments and
take such other actions with respect to the Company Stock Plans as shall be
necessary to effect the adjustment referred to in this _Section 2.2_ ,
including notifying all participants in the Company Stock Plans of such
adjustment.

  

2.2.3  Purchaser shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
for delivery upon exercise or settlement of the Converted Stock-Based Awards
in accordance with this _Section 2.2_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, if and to the extent necessary to cause a sufficient
number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be registered and issuable
under Converted Stock-Based Awards, Purchaser shall file a post-
effective amendment to the Registration Statement or one or more registration
statements on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with
respect to the shares of Purchaser Common

Stock subject to Converted Stock-Based Awards and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such Converted Stock-Based Awards remain outstanding.

  

2.3  Exchange Procedure.

  

2.3.1  Prior to or at the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
deposit with Computershare Investor Services, LLC, or such other bank or
trust company as Purchaser may designate (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether represented by Certificates or held as Book-
Entry Shares, (a) shares of Purchaser Common Stock, in the aggregate amount
equal to the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock to which holders of
Company Common Stock are entitled based on the Exchange Ratio pursuant to
_Section 2.1.2_ and (b) cash in the aggregate amount sufficient to make
payment of the Cash Consideration to which holders of Company Common Stock are
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1.2_. In addition, Purchaser shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent, prior to or at the Effective Time and as necessary
from time to time after the Effective Time, cash in an amount sufficient to
make payment in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.9_ , and
payment of any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section
2.4_. All such shares of Purchaser Common Stock and cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.3.1_ is referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_."

  

2.3.2  As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, Purchaser shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of shares of Company Common Stock (other than the Excluded Shares), as
of the Effective Time, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in
customary form and shall specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of
loss and title to Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will pass, only upon
proper delivery of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.9_ , and
any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.4_.

  

2.3.3  Upon surrender of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, each holder of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (a) certificated or book-
entry shares representing the number of whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock
and cash in the amount of the Cash Consideration to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1.2_ , (b) cash in lieu of any fractional
shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.9_ , and (c) any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.4,_ and such Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

  

2.3.4  In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of Company, payment of
the

   

5

* * * 

--- 

 


--- 

    

Merger Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if
properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the transfer or establish, to the reasonable satisfaction of
Purchaser, that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3.4_ , each Certificate and
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to
_Section 2.9_ , and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.4_.

  

2.3.5  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for one
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Purchaser, upon demand,
and any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not then
complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Purchaser for,
and Purchaser shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
_Section 2.9_ , and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.3_ , in accordance with this _Article II_.

  

2.4   _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Purchaser Common Stock with a
record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the shares of
Purchaser Common Stock that the holder of such unsurrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share has the right to receive upon the surrender of such
unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share and no cash payment in lieu of
fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to _Section 2.9_ , until the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share shall have surrendered such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to escheat or other
applicable Law, following the surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, there shall be paid to the record holder of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, with respect to such
shares of Purchaser Common Stock (a) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date and a payment
date on or after the Effective Time and on or prior to the date of such
surrender and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Purchaser Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.9_ , and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date on or after the Effective Time but
prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender
payable with respect to such shares of Purchaser Common Stock.

  

2.5   _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant
to _Section 2.9_ , and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant
to _Section 2.4_ upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the close
of business on the Closing Date, the share transfer books of Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further

registration of transfers on the share transfer books of Company of shares of
Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock, except as otherwise provided in this Plan of Merger or by
applicable Law.

  

2.6   _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, none of Company, Purchaser, or the Surviving Corporation will be liable
to any Company Shareholder or any other Person in respect of any cash
properly delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  

2.7   _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that
any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, Purchaser or the Exchange
Agent will, upon the receipt of an affidavit of that fact by the holder of
such Certificate in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser or
the Exchange Agent, pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
payable pursuant to _Section 2.9_ , and any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to _Section 2.4_ payable in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock previously evidenced by such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate. Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, as a condition precedent to the
payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.9_ , and any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.4_ , may require the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such amount as
Purchaser or the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct (which amount shall be
consistent with Purchaser\'s or Exchange Agent\'s customary procedure for
Purchaser\'s existing shareholders) as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Purchaser with respect to such Certificate.

  

2.8   _Withholding Rights_. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold, or cause to be deducted or withheld, from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Plan of Merger such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with
the relevant Governmental Entity by Purchaser, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Plan of Merger as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Purchaser.

  

2.9   _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall be issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividends
or other distributions of Purchaser shall be paid with respect to such
fractional share interests, and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner to vote or to have any rights of a holder of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan of
Merger, each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Purchaser Common Stock
(determined after taking into account all Certificates and Book-Entry Shares
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu of such fractional part of a
share of Purchaser Common Stock, cash (without interest) in an amount equal
to the product of (a) such fractional part of a share of Purchaser Common
Stock multiplied by (b) the Average Purchaser Closing Price.

2.10   _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Article II_ , if, between the date of this Plan of Merger and the Effective
Time, there is declared (with an effective time prior to the Effective Time)
or effected a reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split (including a reverse stock split), split-up, stock dividend or stock
distribution (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Purchaser Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
combination, exchange, or readjustment of shares with respect to, or rights
issued in respect of, Purchaser Common Stock or Company Common Stock, the
Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted accordingly to provide to
the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Plan of Merger prior to such event. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this _Section 2.10_ , no adjustment shall be made in the event
of the issuance of additional shares of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to any
dividend reinvestment plan or direct investment plan of Purchaser, pursuant
to the exercise of stock options awarded under any director, employee or
affiliate stock option plans of Purchaser or its subsidiaries, or upon the
grant or sale of shares or rights to receive shares to or for the account of
any director, employee, or affiliate of Purchaser or any of its subsidiaries
pursuant to any stock option or other compensation or benefit plans of
Purchaser, or in connection with the issuance of shares as merger
consideration in a transaction where Purchaser is the surviving corporation
or in connection with any offering of shares where Purchaser receives
consideration in exchange for the shares so offered.

  

2.11   _Adjustments to Cash Consideration_. At the Effective Time, the
aggregate Cash Consideration shall be adjusted, if applicable, as follows:

  

2.11.1   _Shareholders\' Equity_. If, as of the Final Statement
Date, the Company Consolidated Shareholders\' Equity is less than
$90,000,000, the aggregate Cash Consideration shall be reduced by an amount
equal to (a) $90,000,000 minus (b) the Company Consolidated Shareholders\'
Equity as of the Final Statement Date (the " _Shareholders\' Equity Price
Adjustment_ ");  _provided_ , that, for purposes of this _Section_ _2.11.1_ ,
$90,000,000 shall be reduced by an amount equal to $33,333 for each day, if
any, that the date of the Closing occurs before June 30, 2015.

  

2.11.2   _Environmental Price Adjustment._ If the after-tax cost of
all remedial or other corrective actions and measures required by applicable
Law to be taken with respect to the Investigated Properties (the "
_Environmental Costs_ ") are in excess of $1,000,000, the aggregate Cash
Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to (a) the after-tax
Environmental Costs minus (b) $1,000,000 (the " _Environmental Price
Adjustment_ ").

  

2.11.3   _Cash Consideration Adjustment_. Subject to the satisfaction
of _Section 2.11.1_ or _Section 2.11.2_ , the Cash Consideration shall be
decreased to an amount determined by dividing (a) the aggregate Cash
Consideration minus the Shareholders\' Equity Price Adjustment, if
applicable, and minus the Environmental Price Adjustment, if applicable, and
(b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as of
the Effective Time.

2.12  Upset Condition.

  

2.12.1  The " _Upset Condition_ " shall have occurred if both of
the following conditions exist as of the last day of the Pricing Period: (a)
the Average Purchaser Closing Price is less than $23.58 (the " _Floor
Purchaser Price_ "); and (b) the number determined by dividing the Average
Purchaser Closing Price by $29.47 (the " _Initial Purchaser Price_ ") is less
than the number obtained by subtracting (i) 20% from (ii) the quotient
obtained by dividing the Final Index Price by the Initial Index Price. The "
_Initial Index Price_ " means the closing price of the KBW Regional Banking
Index (KRX), a sector index maintained by the Nasdaq Stock Market (" _Bank
Index_ ") on January 2, 2015. The " _Average Purchaser Closing Price_ " means
the average volume weighted trading price per share of Purchaser Common Stock
on which shares of Purchaser Common Stock were actually traded in transactions
reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (the " _Pricing Period_ ") during
the thirty (30) trading days preceding the fifth (5th) Business Day preceding
the Closing Date. The " _Final Index Price_ " means the closing price of the
Bank Index on the last day of the Pricing Period.

  

2.12.2  If the Upset Condition exists as of the last day of the
Pricing Period, Company shall have the right, exercisable at any time prior
to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time on the second Business Day after the last day of
the Pricing Period (the " _Exercise Period_ ") to (a) proceed with the Merger
on the basis of the Exchange Ratio set forth in _Section 2.1.2_ , subject to
applicable adjustment as provided in _Section 2.10_ and _Section 2.11_ , by
delivering to Purchaser within the Exercise Period written notice of its
decision to do so or by failing to deliver any notice to Purchaser; or (b)
request Purchaser to adjust the Exchange Ratio by delivering to Purchaser
within the Exercise Period written notice to such effect (an "
_Increase Notice_ ") to a ratio computed by multiplying the Exchange Ratio by
a fraction that has as its numerator the Floor Purchaser Price and that has
as its denominator the Average Purchaser Closing Price (the " _Adjusted
Exchange Ratio_ ").

  

2.12.3  If the Upset Condition occurs and Purchaser receives an
Increase Notice, Purchaser shall either accept or decline the
Adjusted Exchange Ratio by delivering written notice of its decision to
Company at or before 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time on the second Business Day after
receipt of the Increase Notice (the " _Acceptance Period_ "). If Purchaser
accepts the Adjusted Exchange Ratio within the Acceptance Period, this Plan
of Merger shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms except
the Exchange Ratio shall be equal to the Adjusted Exchange Ratio. If
Purchaser declines the Adjusted Exchange Ratio or fails to deliver written
notice of its decision to accept or decline the Adjusted Exchange Ratio within
the Acceptance Period, the Merger shall be abandoned and this Plan of Merger
shall thereupon terminate without further action by Company or Purchaser
effective as of 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time on the Business Day following the
expiration of the Acceptance Period; _provided_ , that if Purchaser so
declines the Adjusted Exchange Ratio or fails to deliver written notice of its
decision to accept or decline the Adjusted Exchange Ratio within the
Acceptance Period, Company may, by written notice delivered to Purchaser at or
before 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time on the Business Day following the expiration
of the Acceptance Period, elect to proceed with the Merger on the basis of the
Exchange Ratio set forth in _Section 2.1.2_ , subject to applicable
adjustment as provided in _Section 2.10_ and _2.11_ , and, upon such
election, no abandonment of the Merger or termination of the Plan of Merger
shall be deemed to have

occurred, this Plan of Merger shall remain in effect in accordance with its
terms, and the Closing shall thereafter occur, in accordance with the terms
of this Plan of Merger.

4.16.1  Purchaser has filed each registration statement, report,
proxy statement, information statement or schedule, together with all
amendments thereto, that were required to be filed with the SEC by Purchaser
since January 1, 2010 (the " _Purchaser SEC Documents_ "). As of their
respective dates, the Purchaser SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and none of such Purchaser SEC
Documents contained at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded
by a filing prior to the date of this Plan of Merger, then on the date of
such filing) any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

  

4.16.2 Each of the principal executive officer of Purchaser and
the principal financial officer of Purchaser (or each former

officer of Purchaser, as applicable) has made all applicable certifications

906 of SOX with respect to the SEC Documents, and the statements contained in
such certifications are in material compliance with the requirements of the

or executive officers of Purchaser in violation of Section 402 of SOX.

its outside auditors of any (a) "significant deficiency" or (b) "material
weakness" in Purchaser\'s internal controls over financial reporting since
January 1, 2010, To the knowledge of Purchaser, there is no outstanding
"significant deficiency" or "material weakness" that has not been
appropriately and adequately remedied by Purchaser. For purposes of this Plan
of Merger, the terms "significant deficiency" and "material weakness" have
the meanings assigned to them in Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect on the date hereof.

  

4.17 _Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities_. There exist no Liabilities
of Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary other than (a) Liabilities that are
adequately reflected, reserved for or disclosed in the Purchaser
Financial Statements, (b) Liabilities under executory contracts to which
Purchaser or a Purchaser Subsidiary is a party or otherwise incurred in the
ordinary course of business of Purchaser or any Purchaser Subsidiary, or (c)
Liabilities that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

5.3.5  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to
the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board of
Directors may, in connection with a bona fide written Company Takeover
Proposal which Company Takeover Proposal was made after the date of this Plan
of Merger (or that was made prior to the date of this Plan of Merger and
remade after the date of this Plan of Merger) and that did not result from
any breach of this _Section 5.3_, make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminate this Plan of Merger pursuant to _Section
7.1.8_ to enter into a definitive merger agreement or other definitive
purchase or acquisition agreement with respect to such Company Takeover
Proposal, if and only if, prior to taking such action, Company has complied
with its obligations under this _Section 5.3_ and the Company Board of
Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that prior to taking any such action (a) Company has given
Purchaser at least three Business Days prior written notice of its intention
to take such action (which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of any such Company Superior Proposal, including the identity of
the party making such Company Superior Proposal) and has contemporaneously
provided a copy to Purchaser of all written materials (including all
transaction agreements and related documents) with or from the party making
such Company Superior Proposal, (b) Company has negotiated, and has caused
its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Purchaser during such
notice period to the extent Purchaser wishes to negotiate, to enable
Purchaser to revise the terms of this Plan of Merger such that it would cause
such Company Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Company Superior
Proposal and (c) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board
of Directors shall have considered in good faith any changes to this Plan of
Merger proposed in writing by Purchaser, and shall have determined that the
Company Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Company Superior
Proposal if such revisions were to be given effect. In the event of any
material revisions to a Company Takeover Proposal that could have an impact,
influence or other effect on the Company Board of Directors\' decision or
discussion with respect to whether such proposal is a Company
Superior Proposal, Company shall deliver a new written notice to Purchaser
pursuant to the foregoing clause (a) and again comply with the requirements
of this _Section 5.3.5_ with respect to such new written notice; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that references herein to the three Business Day period shall be
deemed to be references to a two Business Day period with respect thereto.

any "stop-look-and-listen" communications to Company Shareholders pursuant to
Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the Company Shareholders) (as if such provisions are
applicable to Company), or (c) making any disclosure to the Company
Shareholders if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Company
Board of Directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable Law;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the taking of any action pursuant to any of the preceding
clauses (a), (b) or (c) shall in no way limit or modify the effect of this
Plan of Merger with respect to any such action taken.

Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other
than Purchaser and its Subsidiaries) or "group", within the meaning of Section

related transactions, any (a) acquisition of assets of Company and its
Subsidiaries equal to more than 10% of Company\'s consolidated assets or to
which more than 10% of Company\'s net income on a consolidated basis are
attributable, (b) acquisition of more than 10% of the outstanding Company
Common Stock or the capital stock of any Subsidiary of Company, (c) tender
offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person
beneficially owning more than 10% of the outstanding Company Common Stock, (d)

recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (e) any combination of the foregoing
types of transactions if the sum of the percentage of consolidated assets,
consolidated net income and Company Common Stock involved is more than 10%;
in each case, other than the Merger.

  

5.3.8  As used in this Plan of Merger, " _Company Superior
Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal that
the Company Board of Directors has determined in its good faith judgment,
after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms
and that is reasonably likely to result in the consummation of a transaction
more favorable to the Company Shareholders from a financial point of view
than the Merger, taking into account (a) all legal, regulatory and financial
aspects of the proposal (including availability of financing and certainty of
closing) and the Person making the proposal; and (b) any changes to the terms
of this Plan of Merger proposed by Purchaser in response to such proposal or
otherwise. For purposes of the definition of "Company Superior Proposal", the
references to "10%" in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal shall be
deemed to be references to "50%."

  

5.3.9  For purposes of this _Section 5.3_ , any breach of this
_Section 5.3_ by any of Company\'s Representatives in his or her individual
capacity shall be deemed to be a breach by Company.

Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law and
following receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened Actions, arising out of, relating to
or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have
occurred at or before the Effective Time in such Indemnified Party\'s capacity
as a director or officer of Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or in
such Indemnified Party\'s capacity as a director, officer, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension
or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request or for the
benefit of Company or any Company Subsidiary, including in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger. All rights to

Merger in respect of the coverages required to be obtained pursuant to this
_Section 5.10.3_ , but in such case shall purchase the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Amount. Alternatively,
the Surviving Corporation may purchase at or after the Effective Time, at a
total aggregate cost not exceeding the Maximum Amount, a six-year prepaid
"tail" policy on terms and conditions providing substantially equivalent
benefits as the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Company and the
Company Subsidiaries for the Indemnified Parties with respect to matters
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the

arrangement, the MBCA, directors\' and officers\' insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to Company or the
Company Subsidiaries or otherwise. The provisions of this _Section

to benefit, and are

enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, each of whom is a third-
party beneficiary of this _Section 5.10_.

successors or assigns (a) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (b) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, in each case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10._

  

5.10.6  Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary, the
indemnification obligations in this _Section 5.10_ are limited by federal
banking and securities Laws and any such obligations that violate any federal
banking or securities Laws or published public policy are void and
unenforceable.

  

5.11   _Takeover Laws_. If any "moratorium," "control share," "fair
price," "affiliate transaction," "business combination" or other anti-
takeover Law is or may become applicable to the Merger, the parties shall use

are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereunder may

the defense or settlement of any such securityholder Action and shall not
settle any such Action without the other party\'s prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  

5.13  Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment.

  

5.13.1  Company and Purchaser intend that the Merger will qualify
as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code (the " _Intended Tax
Treatment_ "), and each shall not, and shall not permit any of their
respective Subsidiaries to, take any action, or fail to take any action, that
would reasonably be expected to jeopardize the qualification of the Merger as
a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Company and Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable efforts, to cause the
Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
