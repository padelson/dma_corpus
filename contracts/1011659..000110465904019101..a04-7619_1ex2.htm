for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code;

  



  

WHEREAS, each of the boards of directors of Parent and Company has approved,
and deem it advisable and in its respective best interests as sole

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein,
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

 **ARTICLE I** ** 
 BANK MERGER**

  



  

Section 1.1 _Bank Merger_.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and pursuant to the provisions of the National Bank Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated by the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency (the " _OCC_ "), at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.6(b)
hereof), Company Bank shall be merged with and into Parent Bank pursuant to
the terms and conditions set forth herein.

  



  

Section 1.2 _Surviving Entity_.  Upon the consummation of the Bank Merger,
the separate corporate existence of Company Bank shall cease and Parent Bank
shall continue as the surviving entity under the laws of the United States.
The name of Parent Bank as the surviving entity of the Bank Merger shall
remain "Union Bank of California, N.A." From and after the Effective Time,
Parent Bank, as the surviving entity of the Bank Merger, shall possess

  

      
   



  

all of the properties and rights and be subject to all of the liabilities
and obligations of Parent Bank and Company Bank, all as more fully described
in the National Bank Act.

  



  

Section 1.3 _Articles of Association of the Surviving Bank_. The Articles of
Association and Bylaws of Parent Bank, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Association and Bylaws of Parent
Bank, as the surviving corporation of the Bank Merger, until either is
thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

  



  

Section 1.4 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Bank_. The directors and
officers of Parent Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors and officers of Parent Bank, as the surviving corporation of the
Bank Merger, until their respective successors shall be duly elected and
qualified or otherwise duly selected.

  



  

Section 1.5 _Principal Office of the Surviving Bank_.  The location of the
principal office of Parent Bank, as the surviving corporation of the Bank
Merger, shall be 400 California Street, San Francisco, CA 94104.

  



  

Section 1.6 _Closing and Effective Time_.  (a) The closing of the
Bank Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Parent
Bank at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time, on the first Business Day of the month
immediately following the month in which the satisfaction and/or waiver of
all conditions set forth in Article VI has occurred (other than those
conditions that are to be satisfied at Closing, but subject to the waiver or
fulfillment of those conditions), or such date as determined under the
procedures set forth in Section 6.4, or another date or place as agreed in
writing by each of the parties hereto (the day on which the Closing takes
place being the " _Closing Date_ ").

  



  

(b) On or before the Closing Date, Parent Bank and Company Bank will file, or
cause to be filed, with the OCC the Bank Merger Agreement in substantially
the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ "), and
such certificates and other documents as Parent Bank and Company Bank may
deem reasonably necessary or appropriate for the Bank Merger. The Bank Merger
Agreement and certificates and other documents shall in each case be in the
form required by and executed in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the National Bank Act. The Bank Merger shall become effective on the Closing
Date at the time requested by Parent Bank in connection with the filing of
the Bank Merger Agreement with the OCC (the " _Effective Time_ ").

  



  

(c) Subject to the provisions of Article VII, failure to consummate the

Parent Bank of any Shares.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fractional shares of

of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Bank Merger; instead, Parent Bank
shall pay an amount of cash (without interest) determined by multiplying the
fraction by the Average Price. There will be no dividends, voting rights
or any other rights as a shareholder in respect of any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock.

Parent Bank, _plus_  (ii) from Parent the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock derived by dividing $137,250,000 by the Average Price; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the maximum number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued

_Valuation Date_ ") and dividing the sum by 10.

  



  

(c) On the Valuation Date, Company shall determine the Net CMO Portfolio
Loss, if any, and the Net FHLB Advance Gain, if any. If the sum of the Net
CMO Portfolio Loss and the Net FHLB Advance Gain results in a negative number
(the " _Net Loss_ "), the Merger Consideration payable to Company on the
Closing Date shall be (x) reduced by the amount of such Net Loss and (y)
increased by any Tax Benefit attributable to the Net Loss (the " _Net
Adjustment_ ") in such proportions of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock
as Company may elect in writing no later than the second trading day of the
NYSE prior to the Closing Date (provided that the total cash portion of the
Merger Consideration, as adjusted by the Net Adjustment, shall not exceed 55%
of the Merger Consideration). The Tax Benefit attributable to the Net Loss
shall be reflected as a reduction to the current Tax liabilities on Company
Banks books.

interest, for all Non-Agency Investment Securities sold during the period
from April 1, 2004 through the Valuation Date  _minus_ (y) the amortized cost
of such securities as of the date of disposition; and

  



  

(B) the difference between (x) the scheduled net premium amortization for the
period commencing on (a) April 1, 2004 for Non-Agency Investment Securities
purchased on or prior to March 31, 2004 and (b) on the date of purchase for
Non-Agency Investment Securities purchased on or after April 1, 2004, through
the expected maturity of each such security, determined as of March 31, 2004
for the Non-Agency Investment Securities purchased on or prior to March 31,
2004, or, for Non-Agency Investment Securities purchased after March 31,
2004, the date of such purchase (in each case as reflected on _Section
2.2(c)(ii)(B) of the Disclosure Schedule_  through December 31, 2004),
_minus_  (y) the actual net premium amortization of all such securities, in
each case ending on the date of disposition of any such security, recorded on
Company Banks books and

  



  

4      
   



  

records for the period April 1, 2004, through the Valuation Date.

  



  

(iii) Company Bank shall determine, in accordance with GAAP and past
practices of Company Bank, the amortized cost for each Non-Agency Investment
Security from April 1, 2004, through the date of disposition of such security
using a methodology consistent with past practices of Company Bank.

  



  

(iv) "Net FHLB Advance Gain" means, with respect to the advances owed to the
Federal Home Loan Bank, for the period from April 1, 2004, through the
Valuation Date, the sum of:

with the determination of such prepayment credits or prepayment fees, as the
case may be, calculated by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco
consistent with the terms and conditions specified in each applicable advance
confirmation and with such amount recorded on Company Banks books and
records as a prepayment fee expense or prepayment credit income; and

  



  

(B) the amount by which any discount amounts exceed any premium amounts
received via the extinguishment of advance liabilities through assumption
transactions to a third party, with the discount or premium in each such
transaction measured as the difference between the principal outstanding on
the advance as of the date of the assumption transaction and the amount of
funds transferred to the assuming party; it being understood that any such
transfer will be an unconditional, complete transfer without recourse or
contingent liability to Company Bank and will have the consent of the FHLB of
San Francisco.  The discount amount will be recorded on Company Banks books
and records as a gain on sale of advance and the premium amount will be
recorded as a loss on sale of advance.

  



  

Section 2.3 _Additional Actions_.  If, at any time after the Effective Time,
Parent Bank shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, assignments
or assurances or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (a) vest,
perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in Parent Bank its right, title

decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares
or securities, appropriate adjustment will be made to the maximum number of

entered into any, and is not the counter-party to, any Derivative
Instruments.  All Derivative Instruments to which Company Bank or Company
Bank Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their properties or assets may
be bound were entered into in the ordinary course of business and, in all
material respects in accordance with then-customary practice and applicable
rules, regulations and policies of bank regulatory

  



  

12      
   



  

authorities applicable to Company Bank and the Company Bank Subsidiaries and
with counterparties believed to be financially responsible at the time.
Company Bank and Company Bank Subsidiary have duly performed in all material
respects all of their respective obligations thereunder to the extent that
such obligations to perform have accrued, and there are no material breaches,
violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party
thereunder. None of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
result as of the Closing in a counterparty under any Derivative Instrument
having the right to accelerate, discontinue, terminate or otherwise modify
any such agreement or arrangement.

  



  

(c) Except for pledges to secure public and trust deposits and borrowings in
the ordinary course of business, none of the investments reflected in the
Financial Statements dated as of December 31, 2003 under the heading
"Mortgage-backed securities available-for-sale," and none of the investment
securities purchased by Company Bank and Company Bank Subsidiary since
December 31, 2003, is subject to any restriction, whether contractual
or statutory, which materially impairs the ability of Company Bank or Company
Bank Subsidiary to freely dispose of such investment at any time, other than
those restrictions permitted or imposed on securities held for investment
under GAAP or restrictions imposed by the Securities Act and the regulations
promulgated thereunder. With respect to all material repurchase agreements
to which Company Bank is a party, Company Bank has a valid, perfected first
lien or security interest in the government securities or other collateral
securing each such repurchase agreement, and the value of the collateral
securing each such repurchase agreement equals or exceeds the amount of the
debt secured by such collateral under such agreement. Except for any
securities sold subject to repurchase obligations in the normal course of
business and any loans or loan participations subject to customary repurchase
obligations, neither Company Bank nor Company Bank Subsidiary has sold or
otherwise disposed of any assets in a transaction in which the acquirer of
such assets or other person has the right, either conditionally or
absolutely, to require Company Bank or any Company Bank Subsidiary to
repurchase or otherwise reacquire any such assets.

  



  

(d) As of December 31, 2003, Company Bank is not a party to any loan

Company Banks existing methodology for determining the adequacy of its ALL,
applied consistently.

  



  

(b) _Section 3.13(b) of the Disclosure Schedule_ includes a list of all
loans that have been classified as "special mention," "substandard,"
"doubtful" and "loss" by Company Bank. For purposes of this Section 3.13(b),
(i) "special mention" shall mean any loan having potential weaknesses that
deserves close attention by management of Company Bank and that if left
uncorrected may result in deterioration of the repayment prospect for the
loan or in Company Banks credit position at some future date, (ii)
"substandard" shall mean any loan that is inadequately protected by the then-
current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor thereof or by the
collateral pledged thereunder, if any, which such loan has a well defined
weakness or weaknesses and for which a distinct possibility exists that
Company Bank will sustain some loss

  



  

13      
   



  

if the deficiencies are not corrected (these loans also include impaired
loans), (iii) "doubtful" shall mean any loan having all the weaknesses of
loans classified as "substandard", with the added characteristics that the
weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently
existing facts, conditions, and values highly questionable and improbable and
(iv) "loss" shall mean any loan considered uncollectible and of such little
value that continuing to carry such loan on the books of Company Bank as an
asset, without establishment of a specific valuation allowance or charge-off,
is not warranted (this classification does not necessarily mean that a loan
has absolutely no recovery or salvage value; but rather, it is not practical
or desirable to defer writing off a basically worthless asset (or portion)
even though partial recovery may be effected in the future).

  



  

Section 3.14 _Insurance_. _Section 3.14 of the Disclosure Schedule_ lists all

valid and currently effective insurance policies in such types and amounts,
if any, as are consistent with customary practices and standards of companies
similarly situated and engaged in business and operations similar to those of
Company Bank and such Subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, there were no
claim(s) in excess of $100,000 made thereunder within the last year. Company
Bank has offered to make available to Parent Bank accurate and complete
copies of the insurance policies, bonds and related applications identified
on such Schedule. All such insurance policies and bonds are in full force
and effect, and no insurer under any insurance policy or bond has canceled or
notified Company of an intention to cancel any such policy or bond or
notified Company in writing of an intention not to renew any such policy or
bond or generally disclaimed liability thereunder for all submitted claims.
Neither Company nor Company Bank is in material default under any such policy
or bond, nor has it failed to give any material notice or present any
material claims thereunder in a timely fashion.

  



  

Section 3.15 _Litigation_. There is no suit, action, investigation or
proceeding, legal, quasi-judicial, administrative or otherwise, pending or,

Company Bank Subsidiaries comply in all material respects with all applicable
Environmental Laws, and neither Company Bank nor any Company Bank
Subsidiaries are subject to any judicial or administrative proceedings

any Company Bank Subsidiaries have received written notice of any
potential liability with respect to any federal, state, local or private
investigation evaluating whether any remedial action is needed to respond to
a release or threatened release of any Hazardous Substance into the
environment. None of Company Bank or Company Bank Subsidiaries are currently
subject to any order, agreement or written directive of a governmental entity
to conduct such investigation or remedial action, nor have Company Bank or
Company Bank Subsidiaries agreed with a private party to conduct any such
investigation or remediation.

  



  

14      
   



  

"Hazardous Substance" shall mean any pollutant, contaminant, petroleum or any
fraction thereof, by-product, asbestos or asbestos-containing material,
polychlorinated biphenyls, urea formaldehyde foam, or any solid, hazardous or
infectious waste, or any other material identified or regulated pursuant to
any Environmental Law.

currently leased by Company Bank or Company Bank Subsidiaries (" _Company

part of the Company Entities Premises has been used for the generation,
manufacture, handling, storage or disposal of Hazardous Substances except in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws;
(y) the Company Entities Premises do not contain any underground storage
tanks; and (z) there are no conditions known to be present at any of the
Company Entities Premises that are reasonably expected to give rise under any
Environmental Law to any material liability on the part of Company Bank or
any Company Bank Subsidiary.

  



  

Section 3.17 _Regulatory Compliance_.  (a) None of Company, Company Bank or
any Company Bank Subsidiary has any formal or informal agreements,
arrangements or understanding with any Regulatory Agency that would
materially impede or delay the ability of Company or Company Bank to obtain

party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to
any order or directive by any Regulatory Agency that currently restricts in
any material respect the conduct of its business or that in any material
manner relates to its capital adequacy, its credit policies, its management
or its business (each, a " _Company Bank Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has
Company Bank, any of the Company Bank Subsidiaries nor, any of
their directors or officers in their capacities as such been advised in
writing by any Regulatory Agency that such Regulatory Agency is considering
issuing or requesting any such Company Bank Regulatory Agreement.

  



  

(c) Company Bank is rated a "satisfactory" or better under the Community
Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the " _CRA_ ").

(a) _Section 3.18(a) of the Disclosure Schedule_ contains an accurate and
complete list, as of the date hereof, of all Company Benefit Plans and

present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
Parent and its Subsidiaries as at the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of operations, changes in shareholders equity and cash flows of such
companies for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to notes and normal year-end audit adjustments).

  



  

(b) Each of Parent Bank, Parent and their Subsidiaries has filed, and will
continue to file, all reports and statements, together with any amendment
required to be made with respect thereto, that it was or will be required to
file with the SEC, the OCC, the FRB, the NYSE and other applicable bank,
securities and other regulatory authorities (except filings which are not
material). As of their respective dates (and without giving effect to any
amendments or modifications filed after the date of this Agreement with
respect to reports and documents filed before the date of this Agreement),
each of such reports and documents, including the financial statements,
exhibits and schedules thereto, complied or will comply in all material
respects with all of the statutes, rules and regulations enforced or
promulgated by the applicable authority and, in the case of documents filed
with the SEC, did not or will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Other than normal examinations conducted by the IRS,
state and local taxing authorities, or the OCC in the regular course of the
business of Parent Bank, Parent or their Subsidiaries, no federal, state or
local governmental agency, commission or other entity has initiated
any proceeding or, to the knowledge of Parent Bank and Parent, investigation
into the business or operations of Parent Bank, Parent or their Subsidiaries
since December 31, 2001. There is no unresolved violation or exception by
the SEC, OCC, FRB or other agency,

  



  

22      
   



  

commission or entity with respect to any report or statement referred to
herein that is material to Parent Bank, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent
and Parent Bank on a consolidated basis. To the extent not available on
Parent SEC Reports filed on public databases, Parent has previously made
available to Company true and correct copies of all publicly available OCC
and FRB filings made by Parent Bank, Parent and any Subsidiary of Parent and
Parent Bank during calendar years 2002, 2003 and 2004 (to date).

  



  

(c) Since December 31, 2003 to the date hereof, there has been no change in
the condition (financial or otherwise), properties, business, or results of
operations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries which, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.

  



  

Section 4.7 _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports,
there is no suit, action, investigation or proceeding, legal, quasi-judicial,
administrative or otherwise, pending or, to the knowledge of Parent Bank and
Parent, threatened, against or affecting Parent Bank, Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent and Parent Bank, or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents, in their capacities as such, except for those
which are not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent or to materially impede or delay the
ability of Parent or Parent Bank to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any
court, governmental department, commission, agency, instrumentality or
arbitrator outstanding against Parent Bank, or any Subsidiary of Parent and
Parent Bank or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
agents, in their capacities as such, which individually or in the aggregate
would reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  



  

Section 4.8 _Compliance with Laws_.  (a) Except as disclosed in the Parent
SEC Reports, the businesses of Parent Bank, Parent and their Subsidiaries are
not being conducted in violation of any law, ordinance or regulation of any
governmental entity, including any laws affecting financial institutions
(including those pertaining to the investment of funds, the lending of money,
the collection of interest and the extension of credit), federal and state
securities laws, laws and regulations relating to financial statements and
reports, truth-in-lending, truth-in-savings, usury, fair credit reporting,
consumer protection, occupational safety, fair employment practices, fair
labor standards and all other laws and regulations relating to employees and
employee benefits, and any statutes or ordinances or other laws
or regulations relating to the respective businesses conducted or the
properties occupied or used by Parent Bank, Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent and Parent Bank, except for possible violations which either
individually or in the aggregate do not and would not reasonably be likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  



  

(b) No investigation or review by any governmental entity with respect to
Parent Bank, Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent and Parent Bank is pending
or, to the knowledge of Parent Bank and Parent, threatened, nor has any
governmental entity indicated to Parent Bank, Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent and Parent Bank an intention to conduct the same, other than normal
regulatory examinations and other investigations or reviews the outcome of
which will not have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  



  

23      
   



  

(c) Parent Bank and Parent are in substantial compliance with the applicable
provisions of the CRA and the regulations promulgated thereunder. As of the
date of this Agreement, neither Parent Bank nor Parent has been advised of
the existence of any fact or circumstance or set of facts or circumstances
which, if true, would cause Parent Bank or any of its Subsidiaries to fail to
be in substantial compliance with such provisions.  Parent Bank has not
received a CRA rating from an applicable regulatory authority which is less
than "satisfactory."

  



  

Section 4.9 _Regulatory Approvals_.  Parent and Parent Bank have no reason to
believe that any Required Regulatory Approvals in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby will not be obtained on a timely basis.
 Without limiting the foregoing, neither Parent, Parent Bank nor any
of their Subsidiaries has any formal or informal agreement, arrangement
or understanding with any Regulatory Agency that would materially impede or
delay the ability of Parent or Parent Bank to obtain any governmental
approvals or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 4.10 _Brokers or Finders_.  Neither Parent, Parent Bank nor any of
their Subsidiaries or Affiliates has entered into any agreement or
arrangement entitling any agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor
or other firm or Person to any brokers or finders fee or any other
commission or similar fee in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

Company acknowledges that, except for the representations and warranties
contained in this Article IV, neither Parent, Parent Bank nor any other
Person acting on behalf of them, makes any representation or warranty,
express or implied, regarding Parent, Parent Bank, Common Stock (or the value
thereof) or any transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent and
Parent Bank hereby disclaim any such representation or warranty,
notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to Company or its employees,
agents or representatives of any information, documents or other material,
including any projections, estimates or budgets.

Required Regulatory Approvals or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or (ii) materially delay the ability of any of the parties to obtain

supervision of Companys or Company Banks personnel and in such a manner as
to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and not to interfere with the normal operations of the

Company, Company Bank or any Company Bank Subsidiary to disclose any
information to Parent Bank if such disclosure would (i) jeopardize any
attorney-client or other legal privilege or (ii) contravene any applicable
Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement (including any confidentiality

Bank in commencing the administration of its payroll, employee benefits and
other employee programs as of the Closing Date with respect to Company

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement shall be binding on the parties hereto and
in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time it shall terminate
only with respect to information relating solely to Company Bank and/or one
or more Company Bank Subsidiaries. The information contained herein, in

authorized representatives pursuant hereto and the terms and existence of
this Agreement and the status of the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be deemed to be Evaluation Material (as defined and subject to the exceptions
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement) until the Closing.

  



  

(c) All information disclosed by Parent or Parent Bank to Company or any of
its representatives, whether prior or subsequent to the date of this
Agreement including any information obtained by Company or its
representatives from, or on behalf of, Parent or

  



  

28      
   



  

Parent Bank shall be kept confidential by Company and its representatives,
except as required by Law, to the same extent and subject to the same use
restrictions as apply to Parent, Parent Bank and its representatives under
the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto and their respective
Affiliates and representatives are each hereby expressly authorized to
disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the
structure and tax aspects of this Agreement and all material of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such Person
related to such structure and tax aspects and it is hereby confirmed that
such Persons have been so authorized since the commencement of discussions
between the parties and their respective representatives regarding this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Efforts and Actions to Cause Closing to Occur_. (a) Prior to the
Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
Parent, Parent Bank, Company Bank and Company shall in good faith use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done and cooperate with each other in
order to do, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Closing as promptly as practicable, including (i) the preparation and filing
of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate
the Closing and the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any
approvals, authorizations, consents, orders, licenses, permits,
qualifications, exemptions or waivers by any third party or
Governmental Entity that may be or may become necessary for the consummation
of the Closing, (ii) defending all lawsuits and other proceedings by or
before any Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement or the consummation
of the Closing, and (iii) causing to be lifted or rescinded any injunction,
decree, ruling, order or other action of any Governmental Entity adversely
affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the Closing. The parties
hereto agree to make, or cause to be made, all appropriate applications,
filings, notifications and reports required to obtain the Required Regulatory
Approvals within 15 Business Days after the date of this Agreement. In
addition, no party hereto shall take any action after the date hereof that
could reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result
in not obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any Governmental
Entity or other Person required to be obtained prior to Closing.  Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall require any party hereto to pay any
consideration to any other Person (other than nominal filing and application
fees to Governmental Entities) from whom any such approvals, authorizations,
consents, orders, licenses, permits qualifications, exemptions or waivers are
requested.

  



  

(b) If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for
information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in respect
of a Required Regulatory Approval, or otherwise, then such party shall
endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request.

  



  

(c) The parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby and work
cooperatively in connection with obtaining the requisite approvals, consents
or orders of each applicable Governmental Entity, including:

(iv) in the case of Parent Bank, effecting the sale or disposition of, or
arranging to hold separate, assets or businesses, or categories of assets or
businesses, or taking such other steps as necessary to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment under any law that may be asserted by any
Regulatory Agency in connection with the Required Regulatory Approvals, in
each case to the extent necessary or required to consummate the Closing;
_provided_ ,  _that_ (A) any such sale, disposition or other steps with
respect to any assets or business of Company Bank would not have, in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Company Bank or (B) any such sale,
disposition or other steps with respect to any assets or business of Parent
or Parent Bank would not have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Company Bank if taken with respect to a comparable amount of assets or
business of Company Bank; and

  



  

(v) consulting and cooperating with one another in connection with all
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings relating to the Required Regulatory Approvals.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Apportionment of Taxes_.

  



  

(i) In order to appropriately apportion any Taxes relating to a period that
includes the Closing Date, the parties hereto will, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, elect with the relevant taxing authority to treat for all
purposes the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period of Company Bank
and the Company Bank Subsidiaries (a " _Short Period_ "), and such period
shall be treated as a Short Period and a period ending on the Closing Date
for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(ii) In any case where applicable law does not permit Company Bank or any
Company Bank Subsidiary to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a Short
Period, then for purposes of this Agreement, the portion of each Tax that is
attributable to operations of whichever among Company Bank and the Company
Bank Subsidiaries cannot make the election required by Section 5.5(a)(i)
above, for the period which would have qualified as a Short Period if such
election had been permitted by applicable law (an " _Interim Period_ ") shall
be (A) in the case of a Tax that is not based on net income, the total amount
of such Tax for the period in question multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the total number of days in the Interim Period, and the

  



  

30      
   



  

denominator of which is the total number of days in such period, and (B) in
the case of a Tax that is based on net income, the Tax that would be due with
respect to the Interim Period if such Interim Period were a Short Period
based upon an interim closing of the books.

  



  

(iii) Except as contemplated by this Agreement, Company shall indemnify
Company Bank, the Company Bank Subsidiaries, Parent Bank and each Affiliate
of Parent Bank from and against (A) all Taxes imposed on Company Bank or any
Company Bank Subsidiary in respect of its income, business, property or
operations or for which Company Bank or any Company Bank Subsidiary may
otherwise be liable for any period ending prior to or on the Closing Date,
including any Short Period or Interim Period, other than any Transfer Taxes,
(B) all Taxes imposed on any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined
or unitary group of which Company Bank or any Company Bank Subsidiary is or
was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including pursuant to Treasury
Regulation section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or
foreign law or regulation, (C) any and all Taxes arising out of a breach of
the representations contained in Section 3.19, or (D) any costs or expenses
with respect to Taxes indemnified hereunder; _provided_  (I) that Company
shall be liable only if and to the extent that such Taxes exceed by more than
$250,000 the amount, if any, of any reserve (excluding any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) and accrued liabilities for Taxes taken into account in the Total
Stockholders Equity as of the Measurement Date and (II) no indemnity shall
be provided under this Section 5.5(a)(iii) for any Taxes resulting from any
transaction of Company Bank or any Company Bank Subsidiary occurring on
the Closing Date that is not in the ordinary course of business, including
any transaction contemplated by this Agreement.  Except as contemplated by
this Agreement neither Company Bank nor any Company Bank Subsidiary shall
engage in any transaction on the Closing Date that is not in the ordinary
course of business. Except as provided in this Section 5.5, Company shall be
under no obligation to indemnify, under this Section 5.5 or otherwise, for
any Taxes of Company Bank or of any Company Bank Subsidiary. Parent Bank
shall be responsible for Taxes and associated expenses not allocated to
Company pursuant to this Section 5.5.

  



  

(iv) From and after the Closing Date, Parent Bank, Company Bank and the
Company Bank Subsidiaries shall indemnify Company and its Affiliates for (A)
any and all Taxes imposed on Company Bank and the Company Bank Subsidiaries
that are not subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 5.5(a)(iii) or
any taxable period or portion thereof that begins after the Closing Date and
that are imposed on Company Bank or any Company Bank Subsidiary and (B) any
costs or expenses with respect to Taxes indemnified hereunder.

  



  

(v) Payment by the indemnitor of any amount due under this Section 5.5 shall
be made within 30 days following written notice by the indemnitee that
payment of such amounts to the appropriate tax authority is due, _provided_
that the indemnitor shall not be required to make any payment earlier than 2
Business Days before it is due to the appropriate tax authority. If
Company receives an assessment of other notice of Taxes due with respect to
Company Bank or any Company Bank Subsidiary for any period ending on or
before the Closing Date (other than Taxes of any

  



  

31      
   



  

affiliated, combined, consolidated or unitary group which included Company
Bank or any Company Bank Subsidiary) for which Company is not responsible, in
whole or in part, pursuant to Section 5.5(a)(iii), then Parent Bank shall pay
such Taxes, or if Company pays such Taxes, then Parent Bank or Company Bank
shall pay to Company, in accordance with the first sentence of this Section
5.5(a)(v), the amount of such Taxes for which Company is not responsible. In
the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance with the provisions of
Section 5.5(e), payment of the Tax to the appropriate tax authority will not
be considered to be due earlier than the date a final determination of such
effect is made by the appropriate taxing authority or court.

  



  

(vi) _Transfer Taxes and Other Closing Expenses_.  Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent Bank shall pay directly, or
reimburse Company promptly upon demand and delivery of proof of payment, all
excise, sales, transfer, documentary, filing, recordation and other similar
taxes, levies, fees and charges, if any (including all real estate taxes and
conveyances and recording fees, if any) that may be imposed upon, or payable
or collectible or incurred in connection with, this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (such Taxes, " _Transfer Taxes_ "). Company
shall cooperate with Parent Bank and, subject to the other terms of this
Agreement, take any action reasonably requested by Parent Bank, which does
not cause Company to incur any cost or material inconvenience in order to
minimize Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.5(b),
which shall not apply to Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, any
Tax Returns that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be
prepared and filed when due by the party primarily or customarily responsible
under the applicable local law for filing such Tax Returns, and such party
will use its reasonable efforts to provide such Tax Returns to the other
party at least 10 Business Days prior to the due date for such Tax Returns.
Except as set forth in Section 5.17(i), all other expenses of Closing will be
paid by the party incurring such expense.

  



  

(b) _Tax Returns_.  (i) ( A) Company shall be responsible for the preparation
and timely filing (taking into account any extensions received from the
relevant tax authorities) of all Tax Returns required by law to be filed by
or on behalf of Company Bank or any Company Bank Subsidiary on or prior to
the Closing Date (without taking into account any extensions received from
the relevant tax authorities); and (B) such Tax Returns shall be true,
correct and complete in all material respects (except to the extent of
amounts reserved or accrued for Tax liabilities in calculating the Total
Stockholders Equity as of the Measurement Date) and accurately set forth all
items to the extent required to be reflected or included in such Tax Returns
by applicable federal, state, local or foreign Tax laws, regulations or
rules.

  



  

(ii) Parent Bank shall be responsible for the preparation and timely filing
(taking into account any extensions received from the relevant tax
authorities) of all Tax Returns required by law to be filed by or on behalf
of Company Bank or any Company Bank Subsidiary after the Closing Date
(without taking into account any extensions received from the relevant
tax authorities), it being understood that all Taxes in respect of any such
period shall be the responsibility of Parent Bank, except for such Taxes
which are allocated to Company under Section 5.5(a).  Such Tax Returns, to
the extent they may give rise to an obligation of Company to indemnify

  



  

32      
   



  

Parent Bank for Taxes under this Section 5.5, shall be true, correct and
complete in all material respects and shall be prepared on a basis consistent
with those prepared for prior taxable periods unless a different treatment of
any item is required by an intervening change in law.

  



  

(iii) Company shall be entitled to review and comment on any Tax Returns for
Company Bank or any Company Bank Subsidiary for any taxable period that
relates to any day(s) on or prior to the Closing Date before such Tax Return
is filed. Parent Bank shall submit a draft of any such Tax Return (with
copies of any relevant schedules, work papers and other documentation then
available) to Company at least 45 days before the date such Tax Return is
required to be filed with the relevant tax authority. Company shall have the
option of providing to Parent Bank, at any time at least 15 days prior to the
due date, written instructions as to how Company wants any, or all, of the
items for which it may be liable reflected on such Tax Return and Parent Bank
shall, in preparing such return, cause the item for which Company is liable
hereunder to be reflected in accordance with Companys instructions, provided
that Company provides Parent Bank with an opinion of nationally recognized
tax counsel concluding that there is substantial authority within the meaning
of U.S. Treasury regulation section 1.6662-4(d) for the position reflected in
Companys instructions, and, in the absence of having received such
instructions, in accordance with past practice, if any, to the
extent permissible under applicable Law.

  



  

(iv) Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, amend any Tax Return
filed or required to be filed for any taxable years or periods ending on or
before the Closing Date; provided that such amended return will not have the
effect of increasing Parents or Parent Banks liability for Taxes for any
period following the Closing Date unless Company indemnifies Parent or Parent
Bank, as applicable, for such increased liability for Taxes. Company shall be
entitled to provide to Parent Bank written instructions as to the amendment
of any Tax Return filed or required to be filed by or on behalf of Company
Bank or any Company Bank Subsidiary for any taxable years or periods ending
on or before the Closing Date, at any time at least 45 days before the date
such amendment is required to be filed with the relevant tax authority.
Parent Bank shall prepare such amendment in accordance with such
instructions, provided that Company provides Parent Bank with an opinion of
nationally recognized tax counsel concluding that there is substantial
authority within the meaning of U.S. Treasury regulation section 1.6662-4(d)
for the position reflected in Companys instructions, and shall cause the
relevant entity to file for and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
receipt of any refund to which Company is entitled under Section 5.5(c)(iv).
Company may elect to direct the prosecution of any such refund claim.

  



  

(c) _Certain Post-Closing Actions which Affect Company s Liability for
Taxes_.

  



  

(i) Parent Bank shall not permit Company Bank to take any action that
reasonably could be expected to increase Companys liability for Taxes
without Companys written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld.

  



  

33      
   



  

(ii) None of Parent Bank or any Affiliate of Parent Bank shall (or shall
cause or permit Company Bank or any Company Bank Subsidiary to) amend, refile
or otherwise modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to Company
Bank or any Company Bank Subsidiary with respect to any taxable year or
period ending on or before the Closing Date (or with respect to any Straddle
Period) without the prior written consent of Company, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed (it being understood that if the amended or
otherwise modified Tax Return increases Company Banks or any Company Bank
Subsidiarys liability for Taxes for which Company is liable under this
Agreement, Companys non-consent to such amendment or modification would be
deemed to be reasonable).

  



  

(iii) None of Parent Bank or any Affiliate of Parent Bank shall carryback for
federal, state, local or foreign tax purposes to any taxable period, or
portion thereof, of Company Bank or Company or any Affiliate of Company
ending before, or which includes, the Closing Date, any operating losses, net
operating losses, capital losses, tax credits or similar items arising in,
resulting from or generated in connection with a taxable year of Parent Bank
or any Affiliate of Parent Bank, or portion thereof, ending on or after the
Closing Date except to the extent Company provides its specific authorization
for such a carryback, which authorization may be withheld in Companys sole
discretion.

  



  

(iv) Any Tax refund or credit (including interest paid or credited with
respect thereto) received or used, in the case of a credit, by Parent Bank,
Company Bank or any Company Bank Subsidiary of Taxes (i) relating to taxable
periods or portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date (except for
any refund taken into account in the calculation of the Total Stockholders
Equity as of the Measurement Date, which shall be the property of Parent
Bank, and if paid to Company, shall be paid over promptly to Parent Bank) or
(ii) attributable to an amount paid by Company under Section 5.5(a) hereof,
shall be the property of Company, and if received by Parent Bank, Company
Bank or any Company Bank Subsidiary shall be paid over promptly to Company.
If an examination of any federal, state, local or other Tax Return of
Company, Company Bank or any Company Bank Subsidiary for any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date shall result (by settlement or
otherwise) in any adjustment which permits Parent Bank, Company Bank or any
Company Bank Subsidiary to increase deductions, losses or tax credits or
decrease the amount of reportable income, gains or recapture of tax credits
(including by way of any increase in basis) for one or more periods ending
after the Closing Date, Company shall notify Parent Bank and provide it with
adequate information so that Parent Bank can reflect on its or Company Banks
Tax Returns such increases in deductions, losses or tax credits or decreases
in income, gains or recapture of tax credits. Parent Bank shall pay
to Company, within 30 days of the receipt of such information, the amount of
any resulting Tax Benefit. For this purpose, Parent Bank, Company Bank or
any Company Bank Subsidiary shall be deemed to recognize a Tax Benefit if,
and to the extent that, its cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of
such taxable year, calculated by excluding any Tax items attributable to such

  



  

34      
   



  

increases in deductions, losses or tax credits or decreases in income, gains
or recapture of tax credits exceeds its actual cumulative liability for Taxes
through the end of such taxable year, calculated by taking into account any
Tax items attributable to such increases in deductions, losses or tax credits
or decreases in income, gains or recapture of tax credits (" _Tax Benefit_
").

  



  

(d) _Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any and all existing
Tax sharing agreements or arrangements, written or oral, between Company and
Company Bank, shall terminate as of the Closing.

  



  

(e) _Contests_.

  



  

(i) After the Closing Date, Parent Bank shall promptly notify Company in
writing of the proposed assessment of the commencement of any Audit or court
proceedings or of any demand or claim on Parent Bank or Company Bank or any
Company Bank Subsidiary which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer or
after the lapse of time, would be grounds for indemnification by Company
under Section 5.5(a). Such notice shall contain factual information (to the
extent known to Parent Bank or Company Bank) describing the asserted Tax
liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or
other document received from any taxing authority in respect of any such
asserted Tax liability. If Parent Bank fails to give Company prompt notice
of an asserted Tax liability as required by this Section 5.5(e), and such
failure results in actual prejudice to Companys ability to contest the
asserted Tax liability, then Company shall be relieved of its obligation to
indemnify for any loss arising out of such asserted Tax liability to the
extent of such actual prejudice.

  



  

(ii) In the case of an Audit or court proceeding (a " _Contest_ ") that
relates to a taxable period ending prior to or on the Closing Date, including
any Short Period or Interim Period, Company shall have the sole right, at its
expense, to control the conduct of such Contest.

  



  

(iii) With respect to periods beginning before the Closing Date and ending
after the Closing Date, Company may elect to direct, through counsel of its
own choosing, any Contest with respect to any asserted Tax liability with
respect to which Parent Bank may seek an indemnity from Company under Section
5.5(a); _provided_ that Company shall consult with Company Bank regarding any
such Contest and shall allow Company Bank to participate in any such
proceeding and _provided_ , _further_ , that no settlement or other
disposition of any claim for Tax which would adversely affect Company Bank,
any Company Bank Subsidiary or Parent Bank in such taxable periods
or subsequent taxable periods shall be agreed to without Company Banks
prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. If Company elects to direct a Contest, they shall within 60 days of
receipt of the notice of asserted Tax liability notify Parent Bank of their
intent to do so, and Parent Bank shall cooperate and shall cause Company Bank
and the Company Bank Subsidiaries to cooperate, at Companys expense, in each
phase of such Contest.  If Company elects not to direct the Contest, Parent
Bank or Company Bank may pay, compromise, or contest such asserted liability.
In such a case, neither Parent Bank nor Company Bank may settle or compromise
any asserted liability without the consent of Company, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

35      
   



  

(iv) Parent Bank and Company agree to cooperate, and Parent Bank agrees to
cause Company Bank and the Company Bank Subsidiaries to cooperate, in the
defense against or compromise of any claim in any Audit or court proceeding.

  



  

(f) _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_.  Company and Parent Bank shall
provide each other with cooperation and information as either of them
reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Returns pursuant to
this Section 5.5 and any Audit or other proceeding with respect to Taxes.
Such cooperation and information shall include the retention and (upon the
other partys request) the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such Audit or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any materials provided hereunder. Each party
shall retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
Company Bank and Company Bank Subsidiaries relating to any taxable
period beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statue of limitations (and, to the extent
notified by Parent Bank or Company, any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods; _provided_  that a party shall not dispose of any materials
if at least 90 days before the end of such period the other party has
notified the disposing party of its desire to review such material in which
case such other party shall be given an opportunity, at its cost and expense,
to remove and retain all or any part of such materials.

  



  

(g) _Survival_. Companys obligation to indemnify Parent Bank for Taxes under
this Section 5.5 shall survive the Closing until 30 days following the
expiration of the statute of limitations (giving effect to any waiver,
mitigation or extension thereof, provided that such waiver, mitigation or
extension was provided with Companys prior written consent) on assessment of
the relevant Tax. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company shall not be
responsible for any claim for indemnification unless Parent Bank shall have,
prior to the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations,
advised Company in writing of the facts that constitute or may give rise to
an alleged claim for indemnification under this Section 5.5 (such claim, a "
_Tax Claim_ "), specifying in reasonable detail the basis under this
Agreement for such claim.

  



  

(h) _Exclusive Remedy_.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Tax Claims will be governed exclusively by this Section 5.5.

  



  

(i) _Tax Covenants_.  Parent Bank and Company intend the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each party will both before and after
the Closing Date (i) use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
transactions to so qualify, (ii) refrain from taking any action that
will cause such transactions to fail to so qualify, and (iii) report the
transactions for Tax purposes as a qualifying reorganization. In addition,
except as contemplated in this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, neither Company nor Company Bank will take any action that could
cause either of them to recognize gross income under Sections 593(e)(2) or
593(g)(3) of the Code on or prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(j) _Certification_.  Company, Company Bank, Parent and Parent Bank shall
execute and deliver to Bingham McCutchen LLP, counsel to Parent and Parent
Bank, certificates substantially in the forms attached hereto as Exhibit C
(in the case of Company and

  



  

36      
   



  

Company Bank) and Exhibit D (in the case of Parent and Parent Bank) at such
time or times as reasonably requested by Bingham McCutchen LLP in connection
with their respective deliveries of tax opinions with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby. None of Company, Company Bank, Parent or
Parent Bank shall take or cause to be taken, either prior to or after the
Effective Time, any action which would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or
cause not to be taken any action which would cause to be untrue) any of the
representations in such certificates.

  



  

Section 5.6 _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the
execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release acceptable to
Parent Bank and Company. Each of Parent Bank and Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates to, not issue or cause the publication of any
press release or disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without prior consultation with the other
party, except as may be required by Law or by any listing agreement with a
national securities exchange, international securities exchange or trading
market.

  



  

Section 5.7 _Employees; Employee Benefits_.  (a) Subject to the terms of this
Section 5.7, Parent Bank will honor in accordance with their terms (i) all
employee benefit obligations to current and former employees of Company Bank
under Company Benefit Plans accrued, earned or otherwise available as of the
Effective Time and (ii) all employment or severance agreements with any such
employees entered into prior to the date hereof.

  



  

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent Bank shall provide or make available
to the employees of Company Bank participation in Parent Bank Benefit Plans
(other than the Parent Bank Separation Pay Plans), on the same terms
available to similarly situated employees of Parent Bank (i) with full credit
for prior service to the extent it would have been credited by Company and
Company Bank for all purposes other than determining eligibility, vesting or
benefit accrual under any Parent Bank defined benefit plan or Parent Banks
retiree medical benefit plan and (ii) with respect to any Parent Bank Benefit
Plan that is a medical, dental, other health, life insurance or disability
plan, without any waiting periods, evidence of insurability (except to the
extent and in a manner consistent with any requirement under an applicable
Parent Bank Benefit Plan to provide such evidence to an independent insurer
to be eligible for group life insurance), or application of any pre-existing
condition limitations. For purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-
insurance and maximum out-of-pocket expenses under the health plans of Parent
Bank, Parent Bank will cause all such health plans to honor any expenses
incurred by the employees of Company Bank and their beneficiaries under
similar plans of Company, in which such expenses apply, during the portion of
the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs. Following the Closing
Date, Parent Bank shall provide or make available to each employee of Company
Bank participation in the Parent Bank Separation Pay Plans but only after any
other severance arrangement applicable to such employee has terminated.

  



  

(c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.7(a) with respect to
individuals with claims under and in respect to the Severance Plan (as
defined in Section 5.7(d)) and any other Company Bank Employees who are
parties to separate agreements providing for the payment of severance
benefits, in lieu of any other Company Bank severance plan payments, Company
Bank Employees who, by reason of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, become employees of Parent Bank and are thereafter terminated
by Parent Bank within twelve

  



  

37      
   



  

months following the Closing Date, will be provided severance benefits by
Parent Bank in accordance with Section 5.7(c) of the Disclosure Schedule.
Thereafter, Company Bank Employees who are terminated other than for cause by
Parent Bank shall be eligible to participate in Parent Banks other severance
plans and programs on the same terms available to similarly situated
employees, with full credit for prior service to the extent it would have
been credited by Company Bank. From and after the Closing, Parent and Parent
Bank shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company and its Affiliates
from and against, and shall pay or reimburse each such Person for, any and
all Losses of Company or any of its Affiliates arising in connection with, as
a result of or otherwise in respect of any actual or alleged termination or
constructive termination of the employment of any Company Bank Employee at or
after the Closing, including any such actual or alleged constructive
termination arising as a direct or indirect result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(d) Effective from and after the Closing, Parent Bank shall assume, honor,
pay and perform any and all obligations and liabilities in respect of, and
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Company and its Affiliates from and
against, and shall pay or reimburse each such Person for, any and all Losses
of Company, any of its Affiliates or any Company Benefit Plan to or in
respect of any Company Bank Employee (or any of his beneficiaries or
dependents) for:

  



  

(i) claims for hospital, medical, dental or other health benefits, expenses
or other reimbursement relating to any medical service, product or
confinement provided to or in respect of any Company Bank Employee (or his
eligible dependents) incurred but not paid prior to the Closing Date to the
extent such claims are recorded on the books of Company Bank as of the
Closing Date in accordance with GAAP and, with respect to Company Bank
Employees that are employees of Company Bank as of the Closing, such claims
incurred on or after the Closing Date in excess of premiums paid to Company
pursuant to the continuation of medical coverage requirements of Section
4980B of the Code or any similar state Law;

  



  

(ii) subject to the payment by Company of the Severance Plan Adjustment
Payment to Company Bank immediately prior to the Closing, compensation and
benefit amounts payable in accordance with the terms of the First Amended and
Restated Brooke Holdings, Inc. Change of Control Severance Plan, as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date (the " _Severance Plan_ "), in respect
of any Company Bank Employee eligible to participate in the Severance Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date and all claims in respect thereof,
provided that, with the prior written consent of any such Company Bank
Employee and subject to such Company Bank Employees prior execution and
delivery to Company of a valid general release of all claims against Company
or any of its Affiliates, in form and substance satisfactory to Company,
Parent and Parent Bank may agree to pay or provide such Company Bank Employee
compensation and/or benefits in lieu of any payments of benefits such Company
Bank Employee is or may become entitled to under the Severance Plan; and

  



  

(iii) subject to the transfer by Company to Company Bank, immediately prior
to the Closing, of an amount, in cash, equal to the aggregate amount
credited, immediately prior to the Closing, to the account balances of the
Company Bank

  



  

38      
   



  

Employees under the Company Deferred Income Plan employed by Company Bank as
of the Closing (the " _Deferred Compensation Payment_ "), claims of any such
Company Bank Employee under or in respect of the Company Deferred Income
Plan.

  



  

(e) For purposes of Section 5.7(d), " _Severance Plan Adjustment Payment_ "
shall mean an amount, in cash, equal to the excess of (i) the sum of (A) the
aggregate cash compensation that would be payable under the Severance Plan to
Company Bank Employees who are eligible to participate in the Severance Plan
immediately prior to the Closing in connection with a qualifying termination
of any such employees employment as of the Closing based on such Company
Bank Employees current annual rate of salary plus (B) the estimated
aggregate cash value of the health and welfare benefits available to such
Company Bank Employee and (C) the amount payable to or in respect of such
Company Bank Employee under the Severance Plan for defined contribution plan
contributions, over (ii) the amount accrued on Company Banks books as of the
Closing Date for payments to Company Bank Employees then covered under the
Severance Plan in respect of any long-term or annual incentive compensation,
such excess to be reduced by any Tax Benefit to Company Bank attributable to
a hypothetical payment of such excess amount by Company Bank to Company Bank
Employees immediately prior to the Closing. Immediately prior to the Closing,
Company shall (x) deliver to Parent Bank a written schedule setting forth
the portion of the Severance Plan Adjustment Payment allocable to each
eligible Company Bank Employee (in substantially the form, and using the
methodology, set forth in _Section 5.7(e) of the Disclosure Schedule_ ),
without reduction for any related Tax Benefit or accrual, and the portion of
the Deferred Compensation Payment allocable to each eligible Company Bank
Employee and (y) transfer to Company Bank an amount equal to the sum of (i)
the Severance Plan Adjustment Payment and (ii) the Deferred Compensation
Payment.

  



  

(f) Company Bank shall adopt a resolution of its Board of Directors to
terminate its participation in the Company Defined Contribution Retirement
Plan (the " _DC Plan_ "), such termination to be effective immediately prior
to the Closing, and shall vest the account balances of those Company Bank
Employees who are active participants in the DC Plan as of such termination.
Company Bank shall provide to Parent Bank copies of all executed resolutions
by the Board of Directors of Company Bank terminating participation in the DC
Plan. Immediately prior to the Closing, Company Bank shall contribute an
aggregate cash amount to the trust forming part of the DC Plan on behalf of
those Company Bank Employees who are active participants in the DC Plan
immediately prior to such termination of Company Bank participation (the "
_Affected Employees_ ") equal to the sum of (i) the "Employer Matching
Contribution" (as defined in the DC Plan) payable for the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs under the terms of the DC Plan with respect to the
elective deferral contributions actually made by the Affected Employees to
the DC Plan for the portion of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs
ending on the Closing Date and (ii) a pro rata portion of the "Employer
Profit Sharing Contribution" (as defined in the DC Plan) payable in respect
of the Affected Employees for the calendar year in which the Closing occurs
under the terms of the DC Plan, at a contribution rate of not less than 4%
and not greater than 6% with such rate determined by Company in
accordance with existing procedures, such pro rata portion to be determined
by multiplying the annualized amount of such Employer Profit Sharing
Contribution by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in
the portion of calendar year in which the Closing occurs ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is 365; provided that

  



  

39      
   



  

the amount of such Employer Matching Contribution and Employer Profit
Sharing Contribution shall be determined without regard to any requirement
under the DC Plan that a participant be employed on the last day of a year.

  



  

(g) From and after the Closing, Parent Bank shall continue in effect the
Company Bank Deferred Income Plan (the " _Company Bank DIP_ ") in accordance
with its terms as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, subject to the
following:

  



  

(i) The Company Bank DIP shall have been amended prior to the Closing to
exclude liability for payment of deferred compensation thereunder to persons
who are not current employees of Company Bank at the Closing, and Parent Bank
shall not have any liability for the payment of any deferred compensation to
such persons under the Company Bank DIP or otherwise;

  



  

(ii) Parent Bank shall be substituted for Company under the Company Bank DIP
effective as of the Closing, and, subject to Section 5.7(g)(iii) and (iv),
shall have full power and authority to amend or terminate such plan in any
respect, in its sole discretion, in accordance with the terms of such plan;

  



  

(iii) Parent Bank may specifically amend the Company Bank DIP effective
immediately following the Closing to terminate the ability of employees to
defer compensation under that plan, and to provide that all amounts for which
deferral elections are in effect under the Company Bank DIP as of the Closing
(whether earned before or after the Closing and, including current elections
to defer any bonuses payable in connection with the Bank Merger and/or any
amounts payable under the Severance Plan) (the " _Existing Elections_ ") (it
being understood that, with respect to each participant, a separate Existing
Election is in place for each deferral plan year and, with respect to 2004,
two separate Existing Elections are in place for each participant who is also
a participant in the Severance Plan and who elected to defer any amount
payable in connection with the Bank Merger or any amount payable under the
Severance Plan) shall be honored and deferred and payable on a deferred basis
under the deferred compensation plan maintained by Parent Bank in accordance
with terms of the Parent Bank DIP, as it may be amended from time to time
(the " _Parent Bank DIP_ ") (including the provisions of Parent Banks
deferred compensation plan applicable to subsequent deferral elections and
deemed investment returns); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent Bank shall
not cause, and no amendment, termination or other action with respect to the
Company Bank DIP or Parent Bank DIP shall result in, the payment or
distribution of any amount covered by any of the Existing Elections prior to
the expiration of the deferral period for such amount specified in the
applicable Existing Election; and shall permit each of the Existing Elections
to be amended once, after the Closing, subject to and in accordance with such
reasonable timing and other procedural requirements as Parent Bank may
impose, to further defer the commencement of distribution of an amount
covered by such Existing Election for a minimum of five years, except for an
amendment to the Company DIP or the Parent DIP or the limitation on the one
additional change to the Existing Elections, in each case that is required to
be made due to a change in Law after the date of this Agreement to preserve
the continued tax deferral of amounts covered by Existing Elections;

  



  

40      
   



  

(iv) Parent Bank shall permit those Company Bank Employees who are otherwise
eligible to participate in the Parent Bank DIP with respect to the deferral
of compensation after the Closing to participate in the Parent Bank DIP and
shall have no obligation to permit Company Bank Employees who are not
otherwise eligible to participate in such plan after the Closing to so
participate, except to the extent the provisions of such plan apply to
the payment of amounts deferred by such employees pursuant to Existing
Elections; and

  



  

(v) No party hereto makes any representation or warranty regarding the
inclusion or exclusion from federal, state or local taxes of any amounts
deferred under the Company Bank DIP or the Parent Bank DIP, pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise, or of earning or losses attributable to those
amounts.

  



  

(h) [reserved]

  



  

(i) Subject to the payment by Company of the LTIP Payment to Company Bank
immediately prior to the Closing, Parent Bank shall pay to each participant
in Company Banks Long-Term Incentive Plan listed on _Section 5.7(i) of the
Disclosure Schedule_ in a single lump sum as soon as reasonably practical
following the Closing a cash amount equal to the "LTIP Payout" for such
participant. For purposes of Section 5.7(i), "LTIP Payment" shall mean an
amount, in cash, equal to the excess of (i) the LTIP Payout, as set forth in
_Section 5.7(i) of the Disclosure Schedule_ over (ii) the amount accrued for
payments to such participants under the Company Banks Long-Term Incentive
Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date, reduced by any Tax Benefit to
Company Bank attributable to a hypothetical payment of such excess amount by
Company Bank to Company Bank Employees immediately prior to the Closing.
Immediately prior to the Closing, Company shall transfer to Company Bank the
LTIP Payment.

  



  

(j) Parent, Parent Bank, Company and Company Bank shall participate in good
faith to develop retention programs to retain the services of key employees
of Company Bank.  Without limiting the foregoing, Company Bank shall have the
right, after consultation with Parent Bank, to offer retention bonuses or
other retention incentives that in each case Company Bank determines in its
reasonable judgment are necessary or advisable to retain such key employees.

  



  

(k) Prior to the Closing, Company Bank shall, and from and after the Closing,
Parent Bank shall, continue to make normal accruals on its books during 2004
and, if the Closing does not occur in 2004, 2005 for customary bonus payments
to Company Bank Employees and to pay such bonuses, not to exceed the amount
of accruals, in accordance with past practices except as to those payments
Company Bank is obligated to make on or after the Closing pursuant to the
terms of any Company Bank bonus plan or other agreement or Company Benefit
Plan that requires the acceleration of the payment of any such bonus.

  



  

(l) Company Bank shall pay Company Bank Employees immediately prior to the
Closing for all unused "personal time off" hours accrued on the books of
Company Bank as of the Closing Date. As soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, Parent Bank shall credit Company Bank Employees with "sick

(a) Except for any inaccuracy that would not have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent or a material adverse effect on the ability of Parent or Parent
Bank to perform obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
Closing, each representation and warranty in Article IV, without taking into
account any Material Adverse Effect qualification therein, either (i) shall
be accurate as of the Closing Date as though restated on and as of such date

and to the extent the OCC requires longer notice before the Effective Time
can occur) following the delivery of such notice, to the effect set forth on

the Bringdown Date shall be the same day as the Closing Date; _provided_
_further_  that if Company delivers such notice, Parent Bank may elect, upon
2 days notice to Company, to move the Closing to any day on or after the
Bringdown Date.

terminated or abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date:

  



  

(a) By the mutual written consent of Parent Bank and Company;

  



  

(b) By either Company or Parent Bank on prior written notice to the other if
any Governmental Entity in the United States shall have issued an order,
decree or ruling or taken any other action which permanently restrains,
enjoins or otherwise prohibits the Bank Merger and such order, decree, ruling
or other action shall have become final and non-appealable;

  



  

(c) By either Company or Parent Bank on prior written notice to the other if
the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to February 1, 2005 ("
_Termination Date_ "); _provided_ _that_  (i) the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to any party whose
willful failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have
been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of any condition in
Section 6.1, Section 6.2 or Section 6.3 to have been satisfied (it being
understood that failure to waive any such condition shall not be a willful
failure to fulfill an obligation) and (ii) if on the Termination Date the
condition set forth in Section 6.1(b) has not been satisfied and all other
conditions to Closing have been satisfied or waived (other than the
conditions set forth in Section 6.2(c), Section 6.2(d), Section 6.3(c) and
Section 6.3(d) so long as it is reasonably apparent that such conditions will
be able to be satisfied on such day), the Termination Date shall be
automatically extended until July 1, 2005;

  



  

(d) By Company on prior written notice to Parent Bank if any of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.3 shall have become incapable of
fulfillment and shall not have been waived by Company;

  



  

(e) By Company on written notice to Parent if the condition set forth in
Section 6.3(e) has not been satisfied by February 1, 2005;

  



  

(f) By Company on or prior to the last Business Day preceding the Closing if
(i) the Average Price is less than $40.37 and (ii) Parent has not notified
Company in writing of its irrevocable election to issue additional shares of
Parent Common Stock to Company such that the aggregate value of the Parent
Common Stock issued to Company in the Bank Merger (including such additional
shares), determined with reference to the Average Price,

  



  

53      
   



  

equals $137,250,000, as adjusted in accordance with Section 2.2(c) as
applicable with respect to the Merger Consideration paid in shares of Parent
Common Stock; or

  



  

(g) By Parent Bank on prior written notice to Company if any of the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 shall have become
incapable of fulfillment and shall not have been waived by Parent Bank.

  



  

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_.  (a) In the event of the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1, this Agreement (except for
Sections 5.3(b), 5.3(c), 5.6, this Article VII and Article X) shall become
null and void and of no further force or effect, and with no liability on the
part of any party hereto (or any of its directors, officers, employees,
agents, legal and financial advisors or other representatives). Nothing in
this Section 7.2 shall relieve any party to this Agreement of any liability
for breach of this Agreement prior to its termination; _provided_ , _however_
, that (x) in no event shall any party be liable for punitive, exemplary
or special damages and (y) no party shall be liable for consequential damages
for a non-knowing breach of its representations or warranties (and each
party hereby waives any right it may have to obtain any such damages from any
other party).

  



  

(b) Parent agrees that if the condition set forth in Section 6.3(e) has not
been satisfied as a result of a breach by Parent of its obligations to use
best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be declared effective
pursuant to Section 5.17(a) and Company terminates this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.1(e), Company and Company Bank will suffer damages
that are difficult to quantify and include damages related to the decrease in
value of Company Bank, the damage to the franchise of Company Bank as a
result of not completing the Bank Merger and the damage to Company Banks
relationship to its employees and customers. In such event, Parent agrees as
liquidated damages to pay Company $20,000,000 in cash.

  



  

 **ARTICLE VIII** ** 
 INDEMNIFICATION**

  



  

Section 8.1 _Indemnification; Remedies_.  (a) Subject to Section 8.1(b), from

Company shall indemnify Parent and Parent Bank from and against all Losses
incurred by Parent, Parent Bank or their Subsidiaries and the respective
officers and directors of Parent, Parent Bank and their Subsidiaries ("
_Parent Bank Indemnified Persons_ ") that arise out of

  



  

(i) any breach by Company or Company Bank of any of their representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement as if such representation or
warranty were made on and as of the Bringdown Date (or, in the case of any
such representation or warranty made as of a date specified therein, any
inaccuracy as of such date), in each case without giving effect to any
revised disclosure contained in the Revised Disclosure Schedule; _provided_
that, for the purposes of determining a breach, any representation that is
limited to the Knowledge of Company or Knowledge of Company Bank shall not be
limited to such knowledge;

  



  

54      
   



  

(ii) any breach by Company or Company Bank of covenants contained in this
Agreement;

  



  

(iii) any matters arising prior to the Closing in connection with indemnity
of officers and directors pursuant to Section 5.8;

  



  

(iv) any claims, liabilities or obligations of Company Bank or any Company
Bank Subsidiary incurred or arising prior to the Closing Date (other than
accounts payable or other accrued payment obligations on the books of Company
Bank as of the Closing Date) related to the matters set forth on _Section
8.1(a)(iv) of the Disclosure Schedule_ ; and

  



  

(v) Any Environmental Action relating to groundwater or soil conditions, or
the presence of underground storage tanks, at the locations listed on
_Section 8.1(a)(v) of the Disclosure Schedule_ , except to the extent Parent,
Parent Bank or any of their respective agents (x) cause, contribute to
or exacerbate such conditions, or (y) by voluntary or discretionary
action, accelerate the timing or increase the cost of any such Environmental
Action; _provided_   _that_ the use and occupancy of any such location to
which an Environmental Action relates is substantially the same as its use
and occupancy as of the Closing Date. With respect to the location listed as
item 1 of _Section 8.1(a)(v) of the Disclosure Schedule_ , Company shall
control the completion of the investigation, testing and monitoring efforts
including all contact with the State of California regarding these efforts,
and shall diligently conduct and seek to complete all such investigation,
testing and monitoring efforts in full compliance with all applicable
Environmental Laws. With respect to the location listed as item 1 of
_Section 8.1(a)(v) of the Disclosure Schedule_ , (A) Companys obligations
with regard to such investigation, testing and monitoring efforts shall
include making reasonable best efforts to obtain a letter or other written
statement from governmental authorities exercising jurisdiction over such
location stating that further investigation, testing, remediation and
monitoring efforts are not required and (B) Company shall pay for all
investigation, testing and monitoring efforts, and shall keep such location
free from all mechanics or other liens arising out of such work.  Parent
Bank shall be named as an additional insured on any insurance policy that
Company obtains in connection with any investigation, testing, remediation or
monitoring efforts undertaken with respect to the locations listed as items 1
or 2 of _Section 8.1(a)(v) of the Disclosure Schedule_. With respect to any
remediation efforts undertaken with respect to the location listed as item 1
of _Section 8.1(a)(v) of the Disclosure Schedule_ and any investigation,
testing, remediation and monitoring efforts undertaken with respect to the
location listed as item 2 of _Section 8.1(a)(v) of the Disclosure Schedule_ ,
Parent Bank shall control such efforts in consultation with Company (and
shall pay for such efforts) unless and until it becomes reasonably apparent
that Company will be obligated to make a payment to, or on behalf of, Parent
Bank under this Section 8.1(a)(v) (after giving effect to the limitations in
Section 8.1(b)), after which time Company shall have the option to control
such efforts, in consultation with Parent Bank at Companys expense.  In
respect to any such investigation, testing, remediation and monitoring
efforts controlled by Company, Company shall cause any work undertaken in
connection therewith to be performed (A) in a good and workmanlike manner by
one or more qualified environmental engineers or contractors and each of

  



  

55      
   



  

whom shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent Bank, and (B) in a manner that
provides appropriate protection to Parent Bank and the person and property of
Parent Banks employees working at such locations. Any party controlling any
of the investigation, testing, remediation and monitoring efforts referred to
in this Section 8.1(a)(v) shall seek to complete all such investigation,
testing, remediation and monitoring efforts in full compliance with all
applicable Environmental Laws, shall provide the non-controlling Party with
information relating to developments and findings during the course of such
investigation, testing, remediation and monitoring efforts and shall furnish
to the non-controlling Party, promptly upon receipt or preparation,
information concerning such investigation, testing, remediation and
monitoring efforts including copies of all reports, studies, analyses,
contracts, manifests, orders and correspondence. The non-controlling Party
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate, at its
own expense, in any action or proceeding involving an Environmental Action
related to such locations. " _Environmental Action_ " means any third party
claim, demand, regulatory action or proceeding, order, decree, consent
agreement or notice of potential or actual responsibility or violation that
imposes liability under any Environmental Law.

  



  

(b) Companys indemnification obligation under Section 8.1(a) shall be
subject to each of the following limitations (which limitations shall not
apply to any claim or loss arising from fraud or deliberate or knowing
misrepresentation):

  



  

(i) With respect to indemnification for Losses arising out of or relating to
any breaches of any representation or warranty by Company or Company Bank in

and warranties set forth in Section 3.16 (including any claims under Section
8.1(a)(v)) and Section 3.18 shall survive the Closing until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations (without giving effect to any tolling
or extension agreements entered into without Companys consent, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld); and (B) the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 3.5 and Section 3.23 shall survive the Closing
indefinitely, provided that, in each case described in this Section
8.1(b)(i), Parent or Parent Bank has provided Company with an applicable
Claim Notice with respect to such matter prior to the relevant termination
date;

  



  

(ii) Except with respect to any breach of Section 5.7(d)(i) (with respect to

recorded on the books of Company Bank at the Closing in accordance with
GAAP), Section 5.10 or Section 8.1(a)(iii) (with respect to the cost of
investigation, testing and monitoring only), there shall be no obligation to
indemnify under Section 8.1(a) unless the aggregate of all Losses for which
Company, but for this clause (ii), would be liable under Section 8.1(a)
exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to the Threshold, and then only
to the extent of such excess;

  



  

(iii) Except with respect to any breach of Section 5.7(d)(i) (with respect to
claims incurred but not paid prior to the Closing Date in excess of claims
recorded on the books of Company Bank at the Closing in accordance with
GAAP),

  



  

56      
   



  

Section 5.10 or Section 8.1(a)(iii) (with respect to the cost of
investigation, testing and monitoring only), there shall be no obligation to
indemnify under Section 8.1(a) for any item where the Losses relating thereto
are less than $25,000 (it being understood that such items shall not be
aggregated for purposes of the immediately preceding clause (ii));

  



  

(iv) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under Section 8.1(a) for any
amount, in the aggregate, in excess of $225,000,000;

extent the Loss arises as a result of any action taken or omitted to be taken
by Parent Bank or any of its Affiliates;

  



  

(vi) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under Section 8.1(a) to the
extent that any claim for indemnification relates to an amount of any reserve
or accrual reflected or included in the Financial Statements; and

  



  

(vii) Each Loss shall be reduced by (A) the amount of any insurance proceeds
payable to any Parent Bank Indemnified Person with respect to such Loss, (B)
any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment payable to any Parent
Bank Indemnified Person by any third party with respect to such Loss and (C)
an amount equal to any reduction of income Taxes attributable to such Loss
after taking into account the income tax consequences of all payments
received by any Parent Bank Indemnified Person with respect to such Loss.

  



  

(c) Subject to Section 8.1(d), from and after the Closing, except in
connection with any matter related to Losses for which liquidated damages are
paid pursuant to Section 7.2(b), Parent and Parent Bank shall indemnify
Company from and against all Losses incurred by Company, its Subsidiaries and
the respective directors and officers of Company and its Subsidiaries and,
with respect to Section 8.1(c)(iii) below, each person who controls Company
within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20
of the Exchange Act (collectively " _Company Indemnified Persons_ ") that
arise out of (i) any breach by Parent or Parent Bank of any of
their respective representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
as if such representation or warranty were made on and as of the Closing Date
(or, in the case of any such representation or warranty made as of a date
specified therein, any inaccuracy as of such date), (ii) any breach by Parent
or Parent Bank of its covenants contained in this Agreement (including with
respect to the Registration Procedures) or (iii) any untrue statement or
allegedly untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration
Statement or any amendment thereof, any preliminary prospectus or the
Prospectus (as amended or supplemented if Parent shall have furnished any
amendments or supplements thereto), or any omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such Losses are
caused by any such untrue statement or omission or allegedly untrue statement
or omission based upon information furnished to Parent in writing by or on
behalf of Company expressly for use therein.

  



  

57      
   



  

(d) Parent and Parent Banks respective indemnification obligation under
Section 8.1(c) shall be subject to each of the following limitations (which
limitations shall not apply to any claim or loss arising from fraud or
deliberate or knowing misrepresentation):

  



  

(i) With respect to indemnification for Losses arising out of or relating to
any breaches of any representation or warranty by Parent or Parent Bank in
this Agreement or any breach of any covenant by Parent or Parent Bank at or
before the Closing, such obligation to indemnify shall terminate on the

warranties set forth in Section 4.10 shall survive the Closing indefinitely,
provided that, in each case described in this Section 8.2(d)(i), Company has
provided Parent and Parent Bank with a Claim Notice with respect to such
matter prior to the relevant termination date;

  



  

(ii) The indemnification obligations set forth in Section 8.1(c)(iii) shall
survive the Closing until the applicable statute of limitation (without
giving effect to any tolling or extension agreements entered into without
Parents consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld);

  



  

(iii) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under Section 8.1(c) unless
the aggregate of all Losses for which Parent and Parent Bank, but for this
clause (ii), would be liable under Section 8.1(c) exceeds on a cumulative
basis an amount equal to the Threshold, and then only to the extent of such
excess;

  



  

(iv) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under Section 8.1(c) for any
item where the Losses relating thereto are less than $25,000 (it being
understood that such items shall not be aggregated for purposes of the
immediately preceding clause (ii)); and

  



  

(v) There shall be no obligation to indemnify under Sections 8.1(c)(i) and
(c)(ii) (other than with respect to a breach of Section 2.2(a), with respect
to which the obligations of Parent and Parent Bank, as the case may be, shall
not be subject to any maximum amount or to any limitations set forth in
Section 8.1(d)(iii) or Section 8.1(d)(iv)) for any amount, in the aggregate,
in excess of $10,000,000 and no obligation to indemnify under Section
8.1(c)(iii) for any amount, in the aggregate, in excess of $137,250,000.

  



  

Section 8.2 _Notice of Claim; Defense_.  (a) If (i) any third-
party institutes or asserts any claim, demand, investigation, action or
proceeding (each of the foregoing, a " _Proceeding_ ") that may give rise to
Losses for which a party (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may be liable
for indemnification under this Article VIII (a " _Third-party Claim_ ") or
(ii) any Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (except
in connection with any matter related to Taxes or except as covered by
Section 2.4(c) of the Registration Procedures) (an " _Indemnified Party_ ")
shall have a claim to be indemnified by an Indemnifying Party that does not
involve a Third-party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ "), then, in case of clause
(i) or (ii), the Indemnified Party shall promptly send to the Indemnifying
Party a written notice specifying the nature of such claim and the amount of
all related Liabilities (a " _Claim Notice_ ").  The Indemnifying Party
shall not be relieved of its indemnification obligations under this Article
VIII by the failure of the

  



  

58      
   



  

Indemnified Parties to provide a timely and adequate Claim Notice except to
the extent that it is actually prejudiced by such delay or failure.

  



  

(b) In the event of a Third-party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may elect to
retain counsel of its choice, reasonably acceptable to the relevant
Indemnified Parties, to represent such Indemnified Parties in connection with
such Proceeding and shall pay the fees, charges and disbursements of such
counsel. The Indemnified Parties may participate, at their own expense and
through legal counsel of their choice, in any such Proceeding, provided that
(i) the Indemnifying Party may elect to control the defense of the
Indemnified Parties in connection with such Proceeding and (ii) the
Indemnified Parties and their counsel shall cooperate with the Indemnifying
Party and its counsel in connection with such Proceeding. The Indemnifying
Party shall not settle any such Proceeding without the relevant Indemnified
Parties prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld),
unless the terms of such settlement provide for no relief other than the
payment of monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnifying Party elects not to retain
counsel and assume control of such defense or if both the Indemnifying Party
and any Indemnified Party are parties to or subjects of such Proceeding and
conflicts of interests exist between the Indemnifying Party and such
Indemnified Party, then the Indemnified Parties shall retain counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party in connection with such
Proceeding, and the fees, charges and disbursements of no more than one such
counsel per jurisdiction selected by the Indemnified Parties shall be
reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party.  Under no circumstances will the
Indemnifying Party have any liability in connection with any settlement of
any Proceeding that is entered into without its prior written consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld).

  



  

(c) From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice, at the reasonable request
of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party shall grant the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel, experts and representatives full access,
during normal business hours, to the books, records, personnel and properties
of the Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the Claim Notice
at no cost to the Indemnifying Party (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses of the Indemnified Parties).

  



  

Section 8.3 _Tax Effect of Indemnification Payments_.  All indemnity payments
made pursuant to this Article VIII and Section 5.5 shall be treated for all
Tax purposes as adjustments to the Merger Consideration.

  



  

Section 8.4 _No Duplication; Exclusive Remedy_.  (a) Any liability
for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without duplication of
recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such liability
constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement.

  



  

(b) From and after the Closing, the exclusive remedy of each party in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(whether under this contract or arising under common law or any other Law)
shall be as provided in this Article VIII, except as otherwise specified in
Section 5.5, Section 10.8 and except for common law fraud claims.

  



  

59      
   



  

Section 8.5 _Mitigation_. Parent, Parent Bank and Company shall cooperate
with each other with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect
to which one party is obligated to indemnify the other party or an insurer of
such other party, under this Article VIII or Section 5.5, including by making
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate, whether by seeking claims
against a third party, an insurer or otherwise, any Losses in respect of such
claim or liability and to resolve any such claim or liability.

  



  

Section 8.6 _Potential Contributors_.  If an Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of Losses and the Indemnified
Party could have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a third party
based on the underlying claim or demand asserted against such Indemnifying
Party, then such Indemnified Party shall transfer such of its rights to
proceed against such third party as are necessary to permit such Indemnifying
Party to recover from such third party the amount of such payment.

the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof
or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction or other authority declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties agree that
the court making such determination shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, area or applicability of the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, void or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision.

  



  

Section 10.7 _Governing Law_.  This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New

American Arbitration Association (the " _AAA_ ") (except (A) as otherwise
provided herein and (B) that, to the extent the parties have mutually agreed
not to submit the Dispute to be administered by the AAA, all references in
such rules to the AAA including filings, determinations or appointments to be
made with or by the AAA shall be disregarded and shall be deemed to be

  



  

71      
   



  

references to the parties) before a mediator to be mutually agreed upon by
the parties; _provided_ , that if the parties cannot mutually agree upon a
mediator within such 30-day period, then the parties shall promptly submit
the Dispute to mediation administered by the AAA under its Commercial
Mediation Rules. All communications made in connection with either
negotiations or mediation pursuant to this clause shall be confidential and
shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes
of applicable rules of evidence and as such shall be deemed inadmissible in
any subsequent proceeding (pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.9). For
the avoidance of doubt, either party may terminate the mediation at any time
upon notice in writing to the other party and the mediator.

  



  

(b) If any Dispute shall not be fully resolved through the process outlined
in clause (a) above, such Dispute shall be resolved through proceedings
pursuant to the provisions of Section 10.9.

  



  

Section 10.9 _Jurisdiction_.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law, each party hereto (i) agrees that any claim, action or proceeding by
such party seeking any relief whatsoever arising out of, or in connection
with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought
only in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York and not in any other State or Federal court in the United States of
America or any court in any other country, (ii) agrees to submit to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court for purposes of all legal proceedings
arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iii) waives and agrees not to assert any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such
proceeding brought in such a court or any claim that any such
proceeding brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum,
(iv) agrees that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any
such action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 10.3 (Notices) or
any other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof and (v) agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

that, with regard to all dates and time periods set forth or referred to in
this Agreement, time is of the essence.

  



  

Section 10.11 _Extension; Waiver_.  At any time prior to the Closing Date,
either party hereto may extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other party. Any agreement on the part of a
party to any such extension shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed by or on behalf of such party. The failure of either party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

  



  

Section 10.12 _Jury Trial Waiver_.  EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A
JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT, THE BANK MERGER OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN,

VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL
COUNSEL.

  



  

Section 10.13 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be transferred by either party
(whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other party.  Any transfer of any rights, interests or obligations

authorized as of the date first written above.

Bingham McCutchen LLP 
Three Embarcadero Center 
 San Francisco, CA 94111

  



  

Ladies and Gentleman:

  



  

Reference is made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 1,
2004 (the "Agreement"), by and among Jackson Federal Bank, a federal savings
bank ("Company Bank"), Jackson National Life Insurance Company, a Michigan
insurance corporation and a savings and loan holding company under the
Federal Home Owners Loan Act ("Company"), Union Bank of California, N.A., a
national banking association ("Parent Bank"), and UnionBanCal Corporation, a
Delaware corporation and a registered bank holding company under the Federal
Bank Holding Company Act and the sole shareholder of Parent Bank ("Parent").
All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings
provided for in the Agreement.

  



  

In connection with the opinions to be delivered by Bingham McCutchen LLP
pursuant to Sections 6.2(c) and 6.3(c) of the Agreement in connection with
the consummation of the Bank Merger and recognizing that (i) you will rely on
this letter in delivering said opinions and (ii) the tax opinion may not
accurately describe the consequences of the Bank Merger if any of the
following representations are not accurate in all respects, the undersigned
officers of Company and Company Bank do hereby certify as of the Effective
Time, on behalf of Company and Company Bank, that to the extent the following
facts and representations relate to Company or Company Bank, such
representations are true, complete and correct in all respects:

  



  

1. The Bank Merger will be consummated solely in compliance with the material terms and conditions of the Agreement and none of the material terms and conditions thereof have been waived or modified.

  



  

2. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of other consideration to be exchanged for Company Bank stock in the Bank Merger, was determined through arms length negotiations between Parent and Parent Bank, on the one hand, and Company and Company Bank, on the other hand, and the fair market value of the Parent Common Stock and other consideration received by Company in the Bank Merger will be approximately equal to the fair market value of Company Bank stock surrendered in the Bank Merger.

  



  

3. In connection with the Bank Merger, not more than 55 percent of the value of the outstanding stock of Company Bank will be exchanged for cash (including any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock), and the remaining Company Bank stock will be 

  



  

C-1      
   



  

exchanged exclusively for Parent Common Stock. Company Bank has not redeemed,
purchased or otherwise reacquired and will not redeem, purchase or otherwise
reacquire any of its stock prior to and in connection with the Bank Merger,
either directly or through a person related to Company Bank within the
meaning of U.S. Treasury regulation section 1.368-1(e)(3), and no such
related person has acquired or will acquire Company Bank stock in connection
with the Bank Merger.

  



  

4. Parent Bank will acquire at least 90 percent of the fair market value of Company Banks net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of Company Banks gross assets, in each case held immediately prior to the Bank Merger. Company Bank has no plan or intention to take any action, or fail to take any action prior to the Bank Merger, that would cause Parent Bank to fail, following the Bank Merger, to hold at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by Company Bank immediately prior to the Bank Merger. For purposes of this paragraph 4, the following assets also will be included as assets of Company Bank held immediately prior to the Bank Merger: (i) amounts used by Company Bank to pay reorganization expenses, (ii) any cash or cash equivalents received by Company Bank upon the sale of any investment securities pursuant to Section 5.23(a) of the Agreement not used to repay advances owed to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, but not such investment securities sold, and any cash contributed to Company Bank by Company pursuant to Section 5.7(e) of the Agreement and (iii) all redemptions and distributions (except for regular, normal dividends) made by Company Bank.

  



  

5. The liabilities of Company Bank assumed by Parent Bank and the liabilities to which assets transferred pursuant to the Bank Merger are subject were incurred in the ordinary course of Company Banks business.

  



  

6. Immediately prior to the Bank Merger, Company Bank will be carrying on Company Banks "historic business" or using a "significant portion" of Company Banks "historic business assets" in a business, as such terms are defined in U.S. Treasury regulation section 1.368-1(d).

  



  

7. Subject to Section 5.17(i) of the Agreement, Company, Company Bank, Parent and Parent Bank will each pay their respective expenses incurred in connection with the Bank Merger.

  



  

8. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent and Company Bank or between Parent Bank and Company Bank that was issued, acquired or will be settled at a discount. Parent will assume no liabilities of Company Bank or Company in connection with the Bank Merger.

  



  

9. Company Bank does not have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which any person could acquire stock in Parent Bank that, if exercised or converted, would affect Parents retention of Control of Parent Bank. For purposes of this letter, the capitalized term "Control" means ownership of at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the number of shares of each class of non-voting stock.

  



  

C-2      
   



  

10. Company Bank is not an investment company as defined in Sections 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code.

  



  

11. The fair market value of the assets of Company Bank transferred to Parent Bank equals or exceeds the sum of the liabilities assumed by Parent Bank, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the transferred assets are subject.

  



  

12. Company Bank is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code.

  



  

13. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained-for consideration. The total cash consideration that will be paid in the Bank Merger to Company instead of issuing fractional share interests in Parent Common Stock is not expected to exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Bank Merger to Company in exchange for its Company Bank stock. Company will not receive cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Stock in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

14. Except for open market sales or exchanges pursuant to a stock repurchase program, which sales and stock repurchase program are consistent with Revenue Ruling 99-58 (1999-2 C.B. 701), Company has no plan or intention (i) to sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common Stock received in the Bank Merger (except for fractional share interests), to Parent, to a person related to Parent within the meaning of U.S. Treasury regulation section 1.368-1(e)(3) (a " _Parent Related Person_ "), or to a partnership in which Parent or a Parent Related Person is a partner, or (ii) to enter into a transaction that reduces the risk of ownership of Parent Common Stock received in the Bank Merger with Parent, a Parent Related Person, or any partnership in which Parent or a Parent Related Person is a partner.

  



  

15. There are no interests in Company Bank that could reasonably be treated as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes other than Company Bank stock.

  



  

16. Each of the representations made by Company and Company Bank and facts concerning Company and Company Bank set forth in the Agreement are true, accurate, and complete in all material respects and no information has come to the attention of the undersigned to cause him to believe that any of the facts concerning Company and Company Bank are untrue in a material respect.

  



  

17. Company and Company Bank will not take any position on any U.S. federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other U.S. tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Bank Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or with any of the foregoing representations.

  



  

You are authorized to rely on the representations made above when rendering
your opinion without undertaking any independent verification of any such
representation. Each of Company and Company Bank hereby undertakes to inform
Bingham McCutchen LLP immediately should any of the representations herein
become untrue, incorrect or incomplete at or prior to the Closing of the Bank
Merger.

Bingham McCutchen LLP 
 Three Embarcadero Center 
 San Francisco, CA 94111

  



  

Ladies and Gentleman:

  



  

Reference is made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July 1,
2004 (the "Agreement"), by and among Jackson Federal Bank, a federal savings
bank ("Company Bank"), Jackson National Life Insurance Company, a Michigan
insurance corporation and a savings and loan holding company under the
Federal Home Owners Loan Act ("Company"), Union Bank of California, N.A., a
national banking association ("Parent Bank"), and UnionBanCal Corporation, a
Delaware corporation and a registered bank holding company under the Federal
Bank Holding Company Act and the sole shareholder of Parent Bank ("Parent").
All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings
provided for in the Agreement.

  



  

In connection with the opinions to be delivered by Bingham McCutchen LLP
pursuant to Section 6.2(c) and 6.3(c) of the Agreement in connection with the
consummation of the Bank Merger and recognizing that (i) you will rely on
this letter in delivering said opinions and (ii) the tax opinion may not
accurately describe the consequences of the Bank Merger if any of the
following representations are not accurate in all respects, the undersigned
officers of Parent and Parent Bank do hereby certify as of the Effective
Time, on behalf of Parent and Parent Bank, that to the extent the following
facts and representations relate to Parent and Parent Bank, such
representations are true, complete and correct in all respects:

  



  

1. The Bank Merger will be consummated solely in compliance with the material terms and conditions of the Agreement and none of the material terms and conditions thereof have been waived or modified.

  



  

2. The number of shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of other consideration to be exchanged for Company Bank stock in the Bank Merger, was determined through arms length negotiations between Parent and Parent Bank, on the one hand, and Company and Company Bank, on the other hand, and the fair market value of the Parent Common Stock and other consideration received by Company in the Bank Merger will be approximately equal to the fair market value of Company Bank stock surrendered in the Bank Merger.

  



  

3. In connection with the Bank Merger, not more than 55 __ percent of the value of the outstanding stock of Company Bank will be exchanged for cash (including any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock), and the remaining Company Bank stock will __ be 

  



  

D-1      
   



  

exchanged exclusively for Parent Common Stock. Except for open market
repurchases pursuant to a stock repurchase program, which repurchases and
stock repurchase program are consistent with Revenue Ruling 99-58 (1999-2
C.B. 701), (x) Parent has no plan or intention to redeem, repurchase or
otherwise reacquire Parent Common Stock after the Bank Merger either directly
or through a person related to Parent within the meaning of U.S. Treasury
regulation section 1.368-1(e)(3) (a "Parent Related Person"), (y) no such
Parent Related Person has a plan or intention to purchase Parent Common Stock
after the Bank Merger and (z) no partnership in which Parent or a Parent
Related Person is a partner has a plan or intention to purchase Parent Common
Stock after the Bank Merger. Parent also has not participated, and in
connection with the Bank Merger, will not participate, in a redemption or
acquisition of Company Bank stock by Company Bank or a person related to
Company Bank within the meaning of U.S. Treasury regulation section
l.368-l(e)(3).

  



  

4. Parent Bank will acquire at least 90 percent of the fair market value of Company Banks net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of Company Banks gross assets, in each case held immediately prior to the Bank Merger.  Parent has no plan or intention to take any action, or fail to take any action, that would cause Parent Bank to fail, following the Bank Merger, to hold at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets and at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by Company Bank immediately prior to the Bank Merger (including, for the avoidance of any doubt, any cash or cash equivalents received by Company Bank upon the sale of any investment securities pursuant to Section 5.23(a) of the Agreement not used to repay advances owed to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and any cash contribution to Company Bank by Company pursuant to Section 5.7(e) of the Agreement). For purposes of this paragraph 4, amounts paid by Company Bank to stockholders who receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, amounts used by Company Bank to pay reorganization expenses, and all redemptions and distributions (except for regular, normal dividends) made by Company Bank will be included as assets of Company Bank held immediately prior to the Bank Merger. Any cash or cash equivalents received by Company Bank upon the sale of any investment securities pursuant to Section 5.23(a) of the Agreement not used to repay advances owed to the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco will be employed by Parent Bank in its trade or business. The cash portion of the Merger Consideration will be paid only out of Parent Banks own resources and no portion of such Merger Consideration will be funded, directly or indirectly, by any assets (including cash) of Company Bank. 

  



  

5. Prior to the Bank Merger, Parent will be in Control of Parent Bank and Parent has no plan or intention to take any action that would result in Parent losing Control of Parent Bank, and immediately after the Bank Merger, Parent will be in Control of Parent Bank. For purposes of this letter, the capitalized term "Control" means ownership of at least 80 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80 percent of the number of shares of each class of non-voting stock.

  



  

6. Parent Bank has no plan or intention to issue, and Parent has no plan or intention to cause Parent Bank to issue, additional shares of capital stock in Parent Bank that would result in Parent losing Control of Parent Bank.

  



  

D-2      
   



  

7. Parent has no plan or intention (x) to reacquire or redeem any of the Parent Common Stock issued in the Bank Merger, either directly or through a Parent Related Person or through a partnership in which Parent or a Parent Related Person is a partner or (y) to enter into a transaction that reduces the risk of ownership of Parent Common Stock received in the Bank Merger by Company, either directly or through a Parent Related Person or through a partnership in which Parent or a Parent Related Person is a partner except to the extent that such Parent Common Stock may be repurchased through an open market stock repurchase program of the sort described in paragraph 3, above, and Parent expects and intends that such Parent Common Stock will remain outstanding for the foreseeable future. No stock of Parent Bank will be issued in the Bank Merger.

  



  

8. Parent has no plan or intention to cause Parent Bank to liquidate; to cause Parent Bank or any subsidiary of Parent Bank to merge with or into another corporation after the Closing Date other than into a subsidiary of Parent Bank that is controlled (within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code) by Parent Bank; or to cause Parent Bank to make distributions after the Closing Date except in accordance with its historic business practices. Parent has no plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of the stock of Parent Bank (or cause such sales or dispositions); or cause Parent Bank to sell or otherwise dispose of any of its assets except for dispositions of assets made in the ordinary course of business, transfers of assets described in U.S. Treasury regulation section l.368-2(k)(l), or transfers for fair market value consideration described in Revenue Ruling 88-48, 1988-1 C.B. 117.

  



  

9. Following the Bank Merger, Parent Bank will continue the "historic business" of Company Bank or use a "significant portion" of Company Banks "historic business assets" in ** __** a business, as such terms are defined in U.S. Treasury regulation section 1.368-1(d).

  



  

10. Subject to Section 5.17(i) of the Agreement, Company, Company Bank, Parent and Parent Bank will each pay their respective expenses incurred in connection with the Bank Merger.

  



  

11. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent and Company Bank or between Parent Bank and Company Bank that was issued, acquired or will be settled at a discount, and Parent will assume no liabilities of Company Bank or Company in connection with the Bank Merger.

  



  

12. Parent Bank does not have any outstanding warrants, options, convertible securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which any person could acquire stock in Parent Bank that, if exercised or converted, would affect Parents retention of Control of Parent Bank.

  



  

13. Neither Parent nor Parent Bank is, or will be at the Effective Time, (x) an investment company as defined in Sections 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code, or (y) under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code.

  



  

14. The fair market value of the assets of Company Bank transferred to Parent Bank equals or exceeds the sum of the liabilities assumed by Parent Bank plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to which the transferred assets are subject.

  



  

D-3      
   



  

15. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained-for consideration. The total cash consideration that will be paid in the Bank Merger to Company instead of issuing fractional share interests in Parent Common Stock is not expected to exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be issued in the Bank Merger to Company in exchange for its Company Bank stock. Company will not receive cash in lieu of fractional Parent Common Stock in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Parent Common Stock.

  



  

16. After the Bank Merger, Parent will, and will cause Parent Bank to, comply with the record-keeping and information filing requirements of U.S. Treasury regulation section 1.368-3.

  



  

17. Each of the representations made by Parent and Parent Bank and facts concerning Parent and Parent Bank set forth in the Agreement are true, accurate, and complete in all material respects and no information has come to the attention of the undersigned to cause him to believe that any of the facts concerning Parent or Parent Bank are untrue in a material respect.

  



  

18. Neither Parent nor Parent Bank will take any position on any U.S. federal, state or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other U.S. tax reporting position, that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Bank Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code or with any of the foregoing representations.

  



  

You are authorized to rely on the representations made above when rendering
your opinion without undertaking any independent verification of any such
representation. Each of Parent and Parent Bank hereby undertakes to inform
Bingham McCutchen LLP and Company immediately should any of the
representations herein become untrue, incorrect or incomplete at or prior to
the Closing of the Bank Merger.

 **ARTICLE II**

  



  

 **SERVICES**

  



  

Section 2.1. _Provision of_ _Services: Reimbursement of Expenses_. (a) Company
agrees to provide, or cause to be provided, to Parent Bank each line item of
service (each such item, a " _Line Item of Service_ ") set forth on _Schedule
A_ attached hereto and made a part hereof (all such Line Items of Service
being, collectively, the " _Transition Services_ "), with respect to such
Line Item of Service from the Closing and continuing through the period
indicated on Schedule A (the " _Term_ "), to the extent that this Agreement
has not been terminated pursuant to Section 2.01(c) hereof. Access to and
use of the Transition Services is provided solely for the use of Parent Bank
and any third party contractor hired by Parent Bank, and solely for
the operation of the Business, during the Term.  Parent Bank shall not allow
access to or use of Transition Services by any other third party without the
prior written consent of Company, which consent may be granted or withheld in
Companys sole discretion. Parent Bank shall use best efforts to
become independent of Company with respect to each Line Item of Service as
soon as commercially practicable, but in no event later than the end of the
Term. Companys obligation to provide any Transition Services under this
Agreement shall be limited by scope and extent to the Transition Services
provided to Company Bank immediately prior to the Closing.

  



  

(b) As compensation for the Transition Services to be provided by Company
hereunder, Parent Bank shall pay to Company a fee for each Line Item of
Service determined as set forth on _Schedule A_. Any payments pursuant to
this Agreement shall be made in U.S. Dollars within ten (10) Business Days
after the date of receipt by Parent Bank of the invoice without set-off,
defense or counterclaim and free and clear of any present and future taxes
(other than income taxes), levies, duties, deductions, withholdings, fees,
liabilities and similar charges. Company reserves the right to suspend
performance of

  



  

E-3      
   



  

Transition Services under this Agreement upon failure of Parent Bank to make
any payment pursuant to this Agreement, provided, however, that Company has
given Parent Bank fifteen (15) calendar days prior notice of its intention to
do so, and Bank has not cured such payment default in such period.

  



  

(c) Parent Bank may terminate this Agreement as to any or all Transition
Services before the end of the relevant Term for such service upon thirty
(30)] calendar days prior written notice to Company. If Company shall cease
to provide a particular Line Item of Service for itself or lowers the level
of any Line Item(s) of Service for itself from the level existing as of the
date of this Agreement or the applicable Line Item(s) of Service are provided
by a Third Party Provider and Companys contract with such Third Party
Provider has expired or terminated, Company may cease to provide such similar
Line Item(s) of Service to Bank or lower the level of such Line Item(s) of
Service, effective as of the later of (x) the time that Company ceases to
generally provide such Line Item(s) of Service or generally lowers the level
of such Line Item(s) of Service or the date on which Companys contract with
such Third Party Provider expires or terminates, and (y) following [thirty
(30)] days notice (or such longer period as may be identified on _Schedule
A_) to Parent Bank.

  



  

(d) Company shall cause the Transition Services, to the extent provided by
Company or its Affiliates, to be provided in a manner generally consistent in
all material respects with the manner and level of care with which such
Transition Services were provided before the Closing by Company and its
Affiliates in the ordinary course of business. Company does not now provide
any Line Item(s) of Service using third-party providers with whom Company or
an Affiliate of Company has contracted for such Line Item(s) of Service
(each, a " _Third Party Provider_ "), but may do so, provided, however, that
Parent Bank has given its prior written approval to use of such Third Party
Provider, and such performance is subject to the terms, conditions, and
documentation as Parent Bank may require. Company shall have full
responsibility for termination of Third Party Providers. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY
PROVIDED HEREIN COMPANY MAKES NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF QUALITY,
SUITABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR MERCHANTABILITY OF ANY
GOODS OR SERVICES PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH TRANSITION SERVICES.

  



  

(e) If it appears Transition Services may exceed Companys available capacity
to provide such Transition Services, Company may, subject to subsection (a)
of this Section 2.01, prioritize requests for Transition Services or take
other steps to manage efficiently the provision of such Transition Services
to Parent Bank consistent with its practice immediately prior to the Closing.

  



  

E-4      
   



  

(f) The Transition Services will be provided by Company in accordance with
Companys policies and procedures. If Parent Bank acts in a manner that
is inconsistent with such policies or procedures, Company shall so inform
Parent Bank and provide a copy of any relevant policies and/or procedures to
Parent Bank, and Company and Parent Bank shall then meet and confer, in good
faith, on ways to conform the Transition Services to such policies or
procedures, or conform, modify or manage the policies and procedures to be
consistent with the Transition Services. Any such change shall be evidenced
as soon as practicable by an amendment to _Schedule A_, to the extent an
amendment is deemed necessary by Company or Parent Bank. When changes
permitted under this Section 2.01(f) are made to any Line Item of Service,
such Line Item of Service, as changed, shall immediately be subject to the
provisions of this Agreement and deemed to be a "Line Item of Service" for
all purposes hereunder.

  



  

(g) In the event that Parent Bank requests any support or service not
expressly provided for in _Schedule A_, Company shall consider in good faith
providing such support or service to Parent Bank. If Company decides
to provide such support or service, Parent Bank shall pay for such support
or service an amount to be mutually agreed upon between Parent Bank and
Company, which shall not exceed the fully allocated cost of providing such
support or service. The terms of this Agreement shall apply to the provision
of any such support or service.

  



  

SECTION 2.02. _Confidential Information_. Certain information and documents
disclosed by Parent Bank to Company, by Company to Parent Bank, or which come
to Companys or Parents Bank attention from the other during the course of
performance of this Agreement, constitute a valuable asset of and
are confidential and proprietary to the originating party thereof.

  



  

(a) "Confidential Information" shall include, but not be limited to, any or
all of the following: (i) as to Parent Bank, the names, addresses, telephone
and facsimile numbers, financial data, e-mail addresses, and any other "Non-
Public Personal Information" as that term is used in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act of 1999, regarding its (or its operating subsidiaries or Affiliates)
customers, or prospective customers, (ii) as to both Company, Parent Bank,and
their respective operating subsidiaries or Affiliates, business plans,
processes, policies and procedures for marketing, sales, and customer service
and support activities, financial service pricing and profitability, customer
and vendor contracts and related documents, (iii) as to both Company and
Parent Bank, personal information, performance records, financial,
compensation and benefits data, e-mail addresses, and any other non-public
personal information relating to their respective employees, and (iv) such
other information, documents and data as Company or Parent Bank may from time
to time designate, in it sole and absolute discretion, as confidential.
"Confidential Information" does not include any information that is in the
public domain, other than as a result of breach by the recipient of the
information of its obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

E-5      
   



  

(b) A party hereto receiving Confidential Information from the other shall
not use, nor permit its employees, agents, subcontractors or Affiliates to
use, such data for any purpose whatsoever except strictly in connection with
performance of its contractual duties to Parent Bank under this Agreement;
and will make and enforce policies and procedures in hiring, training,
supervision and monitoring of its staff, agents and subcontractors in proper
handling and protection of such information, and shall maintain such
information in strict confidence.

  



  

(c) Company shall notify Parent Bank of any security, or suspected security
breach of information covered under California Civil Code 1798.82, or any
other breach of Confidential Information, immediately following discovery, if
the information was, or is reasonably believed to have been acquired by an
unauthorized person. Notification must be given in the most expedient time
possible and without unreasonable delay.

  



  

SECTION 2.03. _Access_. Parent Bank agrees that it shall, without charge,
provide Company (or any Affiliate of Company or Third Party
Provider, provided such individuals have been approved in advance by Parent
Bank and provide documentation satisfactory to it) with such access to Parent
Banks premises and/or personnel, and such assistance as may reasonably be
required for Company to perform its obligations under this Agreement. If
Parent Bank has access (either on-site or remotely) to any of Companys
computer systems in relation to the Transition Services, or if Company has
access (either on-site or remotely) to any of Parent Banks computer systems
in relation to the Transition Services, the party making such access shall
limit such access solely to the use of such systems for purposes of the
Transition Services and shall not access or attempt to access any
other computer systems, files, software or services other than those required
for the Transition Services, or those that are publicly available. Each shall
limit such access to those of its employees, agents or contractors with a
bona fide need to have such access in connection with the Transition
Services, and shall follow all of security rules and procedures for
restricting access to the operators computer systems. All user identification
numbers and passwords disclosed to Bank, and to Company by Parent Bank, and
any information obtained by Parent Bank, or by Company as a result of access
to and use of the others computer systems shall be deemed to be, and treated
as, the system operators Confidential Information hereunder.  Company and
Parent Bank shall cooperate in the investigation of any apparent unauthorized
access to any Company computer system and/or information stores. Company
agrees that under no circumstances shall any of Companys agents,
subcontractors or employees, whether full or part-time, connect to any Parent
Bank system or handle any Parent Bank data, for purposes of downloading,
extracting, storing or transmitting information through personally owned,
rented, or borrowed equipment such as, but not exclusive to, laptops, palm
pilots and cell phones. Any exceptions are at variance with Parent Bank
policy and must be approved in advance according to Parent Bank policy
guidelines.

  



  

SECTION 2.04. _Force Majeure and Business Resumption Plan_.  At all times
during the term hereof Company will maintain preparedness for resumption of
Transition Services hereunder following disruption by act of war, sabotage,
terrorism, or armed conflict, by natural occurrences such as fire, flood,
storm or earthquake, or resulting from strike, lockout, telecommunications
failure and other reasonably anticipatable casualties, consistent with its
practice immediately prior to Closing. Neither party shall be liable for delay
or failure to

  



  

E-6      
   



  

perform, in whole or in part, any of its duties under this Agreement by
reason of such disruptions, except, however, to the extent any delay or
disruption in performance, or any failure or damage resulting therefrom, was
caused by failure of that party to comply with its duties under this Section
2.04.

  



  

SECTION 2.05. _Limitations on Liability._ Neither Company nor Parent Bank
shall have any duties or responsibilities hereunder other than those
specifically set forth herein, and no implied obligations shall be read into
this Agreement.  Except for a breach of section 2.02, each waives and shall
not assert, and shall cause its Affiliates to waive and not assert, claims
against the other, its affiliates, and their respective employees arising in
connection with any Transition Services, except for claims arising out of
gross negligence or willful misconduct in the provision of any duties under
this Agreement. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY
INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES OR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING,W ITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF
CUSTOMERS OR CLIENTS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR LOSS OF PROFITS, DAMAGE TO OR LOSS
OF ANY PROPERTY, ANY INTERRUPTION OR LOSS OF SERVICE, OR ANY LOSS
OF BUSINESS, HOWSOEVER CAUSED, OR ARISING IN ANY MANNER FROM THIS AGREEMENT
AND THE PERFORMANCE OR NONPERFORMANCE OF OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, IN AMOUNT
EXCEEDING THE FEES PAID BY PARENT BANK TO COMPANY FOR TRANSITION SERVICES UP
UNTIL THE DATE OF SUCH OCCURRENCE, DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF DAYS FROM THE
DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE DATE OF SUCH OCCURRENCE, MULTIPLIED BY 365.

  



  

SECTION 2.06. _ Indemnity by Company_. ** **Company will defend, indemnify and
hold Parent Bank, and Parent Banks employees, officers and agents ("Parent
Bank Indemnitees") harmless from and against any and all liabilities,
claims, losses, damages, actions and causes of actions, including without
limitation injury to, illness or death of any person or persons, and damage
to or destruction of any property, and claims of infringement and breaches
of confidentiality, which such Parent Bank Indemnitees may sustain or incur
by reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Company or by
Companys employees or agents, in connection with the performance of
Companys duties hereunder. The indemnity and hold harmless provisions of
this Section 2.06 shall not be applicable to any liability proximately caused
by the willful misconduct of any Parent Bank Indemnitee or its employees.
Companys liability for damages, however denominated, under this Section 2.06
shall be limited, in accordance with Section 2.05, to the amount of fees paid
by Parent Bank to Company for Transition Services hereunder through the date

form to Parent, the holders of the Registrable Securities to be included in
such Underwritten Offering and the underwriters, and to contain such terms
and conditions as are generally prevailing in agreements of that type,
including indemnities and contribution provisions substantially similar to,
and no less favorable to the recipient thereof than, those provided in the

Lynch Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated and Morgan Stanley and Co., Inc.
related to the sale by Parent of 5.25% Subordinated Notes due 2013 and a
reasonable and customary black out period during which time Parent may not
issue other equity securities. All of the representations and warranties by,
and the other agreements on the part of, Parent to and for the benefit of
such underwriters included in each such underwriting agreement shall also be
made to and for the benefit of such holders and any or all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting
agreement shall be conditions precedent to the obligations of such holders of
Registrable Securities. No holder of Registrable Securities shall be
required in any such underwriting agreement to make any representations or
warranties to or agreements regarding indemnification or otherwise (other
than for breach of representations or warranties) with Parent or the
underwriters other than representations, warranties or agreements regarding
such holder, such holders Registrable Securities, such holders intended
method of distribution and any other representations required by law.

  



  

(b) _Price and Underwriting Discounts_.  In the case of an Underwritten
Offering of Registrable Securities the price, underwriting discount and other
financial terms for such Registrable Securities of the related underwriting
agreement shall be determined by the holders of such Registrable Securities.

  



  

(c) _Participation in Underwritten Offerings_.  No holder of Registrable
Securities may participate in an Underwritten Offering unless such Person (i)
agrees to sell such Persons Registrable Securities on the basis provided in
any underwriting arrangements approved

  



  

F-5      
   



  

by Company, Parent and the underwriters and (ii) completes and executes all
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and
other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

  



  

2.3. _No Inconsistent Agreements; Additional Rights_. Neither Parent, nor any
holder of Parent securities (other than a holder of Registrable Securities),
may participate in offering securities of Parent in any registration effected
pursuant to this Agreement. Parent will not enter into and is not currently a
party to, any agreement which is, or could be, inconsistent with the rights
granted to the holders of Registrable Securities by this Agreement.

  



  

2.4. _Rules 144_. Parent covenants that it will file the reports required to
be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder (whether or not Parent is
required to file such reports) so long as necessary to permit sales pursuant
to Rule 144 under the Securities Act), and it will take such further action
as any holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably request, all to the
extent required from time to time to enable such holder to sell Registrable
Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the
limitation of the exemptions provided by (i) Rule 144 under the Securities
