Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such
terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 and paragraph (e) of Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange
Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Parent&rsquo;s disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files
or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules
and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to Parent&rsquo;s management as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parent&rsquo;s management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parent&rsquo;s disclosure
controls and procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable SEC Report, or any amendment
thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered
by such report or amendment based on such evaluation. Based on Parent&rsquo;s management&rsquo;s most recently completed evaluation
of Parent&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting, (i) Parent had no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses
in the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
Parent&rsquo;s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) Parent does not have knowledge
of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in Parent&rsquo;s
internal control over financial reporting.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Within fifteen (15) calendar days after
the consummation of the Closing, the Surviving Pubco will file with the SEC (at the Surviving Pubco&rsquo;s sole cost and expense)
a registration statement (the &ldquo;<U>Registration Statement</U>&rdquo;) registering the resale of the Surviving Pubco Class
A Shares purchased by the investor in the Additional Equity Financing (the &ldquo;<U>Shares</U>&rdquo;), and Surviving Pubco shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective as soon as practicable after the
filing thereof. Surviving Pubco will cause such Registration Statement or another registration statement (which may be a &ldquo;shelf&rdquo;
registration statement) to remain effective until the earlier of (i) two years from the issuance of the Shares, or (ii) on the
first date on which the investor can sell all of its Shares (or securities received in exchange therefor) under Rule 144 of the
Securities Act without limitation as to the manner of sale or the amount of such securities that may be sold. The investor will
disclose its beneficial ownership, as determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act, of Surviving Pubco&rsquo;s
securities to Surviving Pubco upon request to assist Surviving Pubco in making the determination described above. Surviving Pubco&rsquo;s
obligations to include the Shares in the Registration Statement are contingent upon the investor furnishing in writing to Surviving
Pubco such information regarding the investor, the securities of Surviving Pubco held by the investor and the intended method of
disposition of the Shares as shall be reasonably requested by Surviving Pubco to effect the registration of the Shares, and shall
execute such documents in connection with such registration as Surviving Pubco may reasonably request that are customary of a selling
stockholder in similar situations. Surviving Pubco may suspend the use of any such registration statement if it determines in the
opinion of counsel for Surviving Pubco that in order for the registration statement to not contain a material misstatement or omission,
an amendment thereto would be needed to include information that would at that time not otherwise be required in a current, quarterly,
or annual report under the Exchange Act; <U>provided</U>, that, Surviving Pubco shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make
such registration statement available for the sale by the investor of such securities as soon as practicable thereafter.</P>
