Article II

 



 

 ** _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Securities_.

 



 

(a) _Effect of Merger_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the
holders of any

 



     

 

 



 

securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

 



 

(i) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.0001 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") held
by the Company as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be
delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof (such shares, " _Canceled
Shares_ ").

 



 

(ii) _Conversion of Converted Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is held by
any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent (other than Merger Sub) (collectively, " _Converted Shares_ ") shall be
converted into and become such number of fully paid and non-assessable common
shares, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation such that the
ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage
of such Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(iii) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Canceled Shares, Converted Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (A)
$27.50 per share in cash, without interest, from Parent (such amount of cash,
the " _Cash Consideration_ "), and (B) a number of validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent
(the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") equal to the Exchange Ratio (and, if
applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable
in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_) (such shares of Parent Common Stock and
any such cash in lieu of fractional shares, together with the Cash
Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Each share of Company Common
Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided in this _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ shall no longer be outstanding and
shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") or book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ "), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Company Common Stock, shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_, the
Merger Consideration.

 



 

(iv) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) fully paid
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number or type of outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a
reclassification, recapitalization, exchange, stock split

 



     

 

 



 

(including a reverse stock split), combination or readjustment of shares or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, the Merger Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly
dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to
provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event. Nothing in this _Section 2.1(b)_ shall be construed to permit any
party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any
other provision of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of Company
Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any Parent Common Stock or to
vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock. All fractional
shares that a single record holder of Company Common Stock would be otherwise
entitled to receive shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to
five (5) decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each record
holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to such
fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest,
rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (i) the amount of
the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder would, but for this _Section 2.1(c)_, be entitled under _Section
2.1(a)(iii)_ and (ii) the Parent Stock Price. As soon as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company
Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests in Parent Common Stock,
the Exchange Agent shall make available such amount, without interest, to the
holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such cash. The payment of
cash in lieu of fractional share interests pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c)_
is not a separately bargained-for consideration.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Designation of Exchange Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Closing, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange agreement with the
transfer agent of Parent, the transfer agent of the Company or another
nationally recognized financial institution or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for
the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_.
At or substantially concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance
with this _Article II_ through the Exchange Agent, (i) book-entry shares
representing the full number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock and (ii) cash in an aggregate amount necessary to pay the
Cash Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration, and Parent shall,
after the Effective Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable,
provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other
distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.2(d)_ (such shares of Parent Common Stock and Cash Consideration
provided to the Exchange Agent, together with any such dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Parent shall
make available to Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time
to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_. In the event the Exchange Fund shall at any
time be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section
2.1(a)(iii)_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited,
additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency in the amount required to

 



     

 

 



 

make such payment. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 2.1_, except as expressly provided
for in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, and in no event
later than the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery of Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be
in the form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions (which instructions shall be in the form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for (A) cash in an amount equal to
the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificates, (B) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry form) representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of such Certificates pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_,
(C) any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_
and (D) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_.

 



 

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent
to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably practicable,
(i) cash in an amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number
of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate,
(ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry
form) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such
holder has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, (iii) any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_ and (iv) any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_, if applicable,
and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) so surrendered
shall be forthwith canceled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required
to deliver a Certificate or letter of transmittal or surrender such Book-Entry
Shares to the Exchange Agent. In lieu thereof, each Book-Entry Share shall
automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver
in exchange therefor as promptly as reasonably practicable, (i) cash in an
amount equal to the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Book-Entry Share, (ii) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry form)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder
has the right to receive in respect of such Book-Entry Shares pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, (iii) any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_ and (iv) any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_, if applicable.
Until surrendered, in the case of a Certificate, or paid, in the case of a
Book-Entry Share, in each case, as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(c)_,
each Certificate or

 



     

 

 



 

Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this _Section 2.2(c)_ and any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_. The Exchange Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and make such payments
and deliveries with respect to Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the cash or other Merger Consideration
payable hereunder.

 



 

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. Subject to applicable
Law, there shall be paid to the holder of the Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange for Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_,
without interest, (i) at the time of delivery of such Parent Common Stock by
the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_, the amount of dividends or
other distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii)
at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
_Section 2.2(c)_, and a payment date subsequent to such delivery of such
Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_,
payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

(e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the
appropriate amount of Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by _Section
2.2(d)_) may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer (and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Exchange
Agent) or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of Parent
that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or its
designee upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent as general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for Merger
Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock as contemplated by _Section 2.2(d)_.

 



 

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common
Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash held in the
Exchange Fund delivered to a Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have
been surrendered or Book-Entry Share not paid, in each case, in accordance
with _Section 2.2(c)_, immediately prior to the date on which any Merger

 



     

 

 



 

Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any
such Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 



 

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that, if
invested other than in the Exchange Agents default cash or cash equivalents
accounts, such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Financial
Services LLC, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase
agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding
$1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest investment
category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of
investment; _provided_ , _further_ that no such investment shall relieve
Parent or the Exchange Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article II_, and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of
Company Common Stock in the amount of such losses. Any interest or income
produced by such investments will be payable to Parent or its designee as
directed by Parent.

 



 

(i) _Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law; provided, that
withholding with respect to any Company Stock Option shall be taken pro-rata
from the Cash Consideration portion of the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such Company Stock Option and pro-rata from the portion of the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of such Company Stock Option in the
form of Parent Common Stock, based on the value of the Merger Consideration
that consists of shares of Parent Common Stock relative to the Cash
Consideration. Any amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Company RSU Awards_.

 



 

(i) As of the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award relating to
shares of Company Common Stock granted under any Company Equity Plan (each, a
" _Company RSU Award_ ") that is held by a non-employee director of the
Company and that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall, to the extent not vested, become fully vested, and shall be canceled
without any action on the part of any holder or beneficiary thereof in
consideration for the right to receive the Merger Consideration as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time in respect of each share of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time, less any applicable withholding or other Taxes or other
amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld; _provided_ that
notwithstanding

 



     

 

 



 

anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any payment of the
Merger Consideration in respect of any such Company RSU Award which
immediately prior to such cancellation was treated as "deferred compensation"
subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made on the earliest possible
date that such payment would not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A
of the Code.

 



 

(ii) As of the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award, other than any Company
RSU Award that is described in _Section 2.3(a)(i)_, that remains outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall,
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and
converted into a restricted stock unit award of Parent (each, an " _Adjusted
RSU Award_ ") on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as
specifically provided in this _Section 2.3(a)(ii)_ and for any changes that
are required solely to reflect the conversion of such Company RSU Award to an
Adjusted RSU Award, relating to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares) equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time by
(B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. In the event that the holder of any such
Adjusted RSU Award experiences a Qualifying Termination upon or within
eighteen (18) months following the Effective Time, (A) such Adjusted RSU Award
shall accelerate and immediately become vested (i) if the holder is not a
participant in a Severance Plan as of the date of such Qualifying Termination,
with respect to the portion of such Adjusted RSU Award that is scheduled to
vest during the twelve (12) month period immediately following the date of the
Qualifying Termination or (ii) if the holder is a participant in a Severance
Plan as of the date of such Qualifying Termination, as required by the terms
of the applicable Severance Plan, and (B) any portion of such Adjusted RSU
Award that does not vest pursuant to clause (A) of this sentence shall be
immediately forfeited upon such Qualifying Termination.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Company Stock Options_.

 



 

(i) As of the Effective Time, each compensatory option to purchase Company
Common Stock granted under any Company Equity Plan (each, a " _Company Stock
Option_ ") that (a) is either (i) vested as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time or (ii) held by a non-employee director of the Company, whether
vested or unvested, and (b) remains outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be cancelled without any action on the part of any
holder thereof in consideration for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time in
respect of each Net Option Share subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, less any applicable withholding or
other Taxes or other amounts required by applicable Law to be withheld. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Net Option Share_ " means, with respect to a
Company Stock Option, the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the value of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to

 



     

 

 



 

such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the
value of the Merger Consideration. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the
value of the Merger Consideration that consists of shares of Parent Common
Stock shall equal the product of (x) the number of such shares of Parent
Common Stock and (y) the Parent Stock Price.

 



 

(ii) As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, other than any
Company Stock Option that is described in _Section 2.3(b)(i)_, that remains
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent and converted into a
compensatory option to purchase Parent Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted
Option_ "), on the same terms and conditions (other than the available methods
for payment of Taxes, which will be determined under Parents equity program
administrative procedures, as in effect from time to time) as were applicable
under such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
except as specifically provided in this Section 2.3(b)(ii) and for any changes
that are required solely to reflect the conversion of such Company Stock
Option to an Adjusted Option, relating to the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. The exercise price per share of
such Adjusted Option shall be an amount equal to the quotient of (A) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio, with any fractional cents rounded up to the next higher number
of whole cents. The exercise price per share of any such Adjusted Option and
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock relating to any such Adjusted
Option will be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case of Company Stock Options that are
intended to qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section
422 of the Code, consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code.
In the event that the holder of any such Adjusted Option experiences a
Qualifying Termination upon or within eighteen (18) months following the
Effective Time, (A) such Adjusted Option shall accelerate and immediately
become vested (i) if the holder is not a participant in a Severance Plan as of
the date of such Qualifying Termination, with respect to the portion of such
Adjusted Option that is scheduled to vest during the twelve (12) month period
immediately following the date of the Qualifying Termination or (ii) if the
holder is a participant in a Severance Plan as of the date of such Qualifying
Termination, as required by the terms of the applicable Severance Plan, and
(B) any portion of such Adjusted Option that does not vest pursuant to clause
(A) of this sentence shall be immediately forfeited upon such Qualifying
Termination.

 



 

(c) _Company ESPP_. Except to the extent it is otherwise determined by Parent
and communicated to the Company that the Company ESPP should continue in
effect under its current terms, promptly following the date of this Agreement
upon confirmation by Parent prior to such action being taken, the Company
Board (or, if applicable, any committee thereof administering the Company
ESPP) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other necessary actions such
that (i) with respect to any Offering Period (as such term is defined in the
Company

 



     

 

 



 

ESPP) outstanding as of the date of this Agreement under the Company ESPP,
such Offering Period shall terminate and each individual participating in the
Company ESPP will be deemed to have purchased a number of shares of Company
Common Stock with the funds in such individuals Plan Account (as such term is
defined in the Company ESPP) in accordance with Section 15 of the Company ESPP
upon the earlier to occur of (A) the day that is four (4) complete Trading

participating in the Company ESPP shall be permitted to (A) increase the

(d) _Parent Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take all
actions necessary for the assumption of the Adjusted RSU Awards, Adjusted
Options and treatment of the Company Equity Awards pursuant to this _Section
2.3_, including the reservation, issuance and listing of a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock as necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by
this _Section 2.3_. Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement on Form S-8, Form S-3 or Form S-1 (or any successor or
other appropriate form), as applicable, with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to each such award under the Company Equity Plans and any
plan interests in any other Company Benefit Plan and shall maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such awards or plan interests remain outstanding. As
soon as practicable after the registration of such shares of Parent Common
Stock or plan interests, as applicable, Parent shall deliver to the holders of
the Adjusted RSU Awards and Adjusted Options appropriate notices setting forth
such holders rights pursuant to the respective Company Equity Plans and
agreements evidencing the grants of such Adjusted RSU Awards and Adjusted
Options, and stating that such Adjusted RSU Awards and Adjusted Options and
agreements have been assumed by Parent and shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this
_Section 2.3_ after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of any Company
Equity Plan).

 



 

(e) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide
such notice, if any, to the extent required under the terms of any Company
Equity Plan, adopt applicable resolutions, amend the terms of any Company
Equity Plan or any outstanding awards, and take all other appropriate actions
to give effect to the transactions contemplated herein. To the extent such
notice or actions are required, the Company shall provide Parent with
documentation evidencing the completion of the foregoing actions (the form and
substance of such documentation shall be subject to review and approval by
Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
not later than three (3) Business Days preceding the Effective Time.

 



      

 

 



 

Section 2.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled
pursuant to this _Article II_.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, to the extent that holders of Company Common Stock are entitled
to appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected his, her or its demand
for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and not effectively
withdrawn or lost such holders rights to appraisal (the " _Dissenting Shares_
"), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive such
consideration as shall be determined pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (it
being understood and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist and such holder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto other than the right to receive the "fair value" of such
Dissenting Shares as determined in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL);
_provided_ that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL (whether occurring before, at or after the Effective Time),
such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall not be
deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give notice to Parent as
promptly as reasonably practicable of any demands for appraisal of any shares
of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company relating to appraisal
demands, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all material
discussions with third parties and all negotiations and Proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to
or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise any such demand or
Proceeding, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for
transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be canceled against delivery
of the applicable Merger Consideration, as provided for in _Section
2.1(a)(iii)_, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

Section 2.7 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation or Parent with full right, title and possession of
and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company with respect to

 



     

 

 



 

the Merger, the officers and managers of Parent shall be fully authorized (in
the name of Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and otherwise)
to take such action.

 



 

Article III

 



 

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_**

 



 

Except (i) as disclosed in the particular section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter expressly referenced therein (it being understood and agreed
that any disclosure set forth in one section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter also shall be deemed to apply to each other section and
subsection of this Agreement to which its applicability is reasonably apparent
on its face from the text of such disclosure) or (ii) other than with respect
to _Section 3.1_, _Section 3.2_, _Section 3.3_, _Section 3.4_ and _Section
3.5_, as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed with (or furnished to)
the SEC by the Company on or after December 31, 2018 and at least one (1)
Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement (but in each case excluding
any disclosure contained under the heading "Risk Factors" (other than any
factual historical information contained therein) or in any "forward-looking
statements" legend or any similar non-specific, predictive, precautionary or
forward-looking statements) and to the extent publicly available on the SECs
Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval System (" _EDGAR_ "), the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

Section 3.1 _Organization; Qualification_. Each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized and validly existing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation, formation or organization, as
applicable, and has the requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
conduct its business as it is now being conducted and to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets in the manner in which its properties and
assets are currently operated, except where the failure to be so validly
existing and authorized has not been, and would not reasonably be expected to
be, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the character or location of the
property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where
the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing has not
had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The Companys Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ ") and
Amended and Restated Bylaws (the " _Bylaws_ "), each as amended through the
date of this Agreement, have been made available to Parent prior to the date
of this Agreement. Such Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws are currently
in effect, and the Company is not in violation of any of the provisions
thereof.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Capitalization; Subsidiaries_.

 



 

(a) As of the close of business on the second (2nd) Business Day prior to the
date of this Agreement (the " _Company Capitalization Date_ "), the authorized
capital stock of the Company consisted of (i) 100,000,000 shares of Company
Common Stock, 37,284,211 of which were issued and outstanding, and none of
which were held by the Company as treasury stock, and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of
preferred stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share

 



     

 

 



 

(" _Company Preferred Stock_ "), no shares of which were outstanding. There
are no other classes of capital stock of the Company and no bonds, debentures,
notes or other Indebtedness or securities of the Company having the right to
vote (or convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to
vote) on any matters on which holders of capital stock of the Company may vote
authorized, issued or outstanding. As of the close of business on the Company
Capitalization Date, there were (A) 2,859,712 shares of Company Common Stock
subject to outstanding Company Stock Options, (B) outstanding Company RSU
Awards representing 726,461 shares of Company Common Stock, (C) 22,531 shares
of Company Common Stock subject to purchase under the Company ESPP in respect
of amounts credited to participant Plan Accounts (as defined in the Company
ESPP), (D) 1,104,042 shares of Company Common Stock reserved for future
issuance under the Company ESPP and (E) 2,458,658 shares of Company Common
Stock reserved for future issuance under the Company Equity Plans. From the
close of business on the Company Capitalization Date through the date of this
Agreement, there have been no issuances of (I) any Company Common Stock,
Company Preferred Stock or any other equity or voting securities or interests
in the Company other than issuances of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the exercise, vesting or settlement, as applicable, of the Company Equity
Awards outstanding as of the close of business on the Company Capitalization
Date in accordance with the terms of such Company Equity Awards or under the
Company ESPP in accordance with its terms or (II) any Company Equity Awards or
any other equity or equity-based awards.

 



 

(b) All of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have
been, and all of the shares of Company Common Stock that may be issued
pursuant to the Company Equity Awards, the Company Equity Plans or the Company
ESPP will be, when issued in accordance with the respective terms thereof,
duly authorized and validly issued and are, or will be when issued, fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. The Company has made
available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement accurate and complete
copies of the Company Equity Plans and the forms of stock option, restricted
stock and restricted stock unit agreements evidencing the Company Equity
Awards, and no award agreement applicable to Company Equity Awards contains
material terms that are not consistent with, or are in addition to, the terms
of such forms. _Section 3.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth,
as of the close of business on the Company Capitalization Date, each
outstanding Company Equity Award and, to the extent applicable, (i) the name
(or employee identification number) and country of residence (if outside the
U.S.) of the holder thereof, (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable thereunder, (iii) the expiration date, (iv) the exercise price
relating thereto, (v) the grant date, (vi) the amount vested and outstanding
and the amount unvested and outstanding, (vii) the Company Equity Plan
pursuant to which the award was made and (viii) whether such award is subject
to Section 409A of the Code. Each grant of a Company Stock Option was duly
authorized no later than the date on which the grant of such Company Stock
Option was by its terms to be effective (the " _Company Option Grant Date_ ")
by all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the
Company Board (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof or other
authorized designee) and any required stockholder approval by the necessary
number of votes or written consents. The Company does not have any liability
in respect of any Company Stock Option that was granted with a per share
exercise price that was less than the fair market value of a share of Company
Common Stock on the applicable Company Option Grant Date, and the Company has
not granted any Company Stock Options that are subject to the provisions of
Section 409A of the Code. Each grant of Company Equity

 



     

 

 



 

Awards was made in accordance with the terms of the Company Equity Plans, the
Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws, including the rules and
regulations of Nasdaq. All of the outstanding Company Common Stock has been
sold pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the federal
securities Laws or an appropriate exemption therefrom. No Subsidiary of the
Company owns any capital stock of the Company.

 



 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, other than as set forth in _Section
3.2(a)_, or, with respect to any foreign Subsidiary of the Company, directors
qualifying shares or similar arrangements required by applicable Law, there
are no (i) existing options, warrants, calls, preemptive rights, subscriptions
or other securities or rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit
awards, convertible securities, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any
kind obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer,
register or sell, or cause to be issued, transferred, registered or sold, any
shares of capital stock or other equity or voting securities or other equity
interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for such shares or other equity or voting securities or

into such options, warrants, calls, preemptive, subscriptions or other
securities or rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards,
convertible securities, agreements, arrangements or commitments, (ii)
outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any capital stock or other equity or
voting securities or other equity interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any securities representing the right to purchase or
otherwise receive any capital stock or other equity or voting securities or
other equity interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii)
stockholder agreements, voting trusts or similar agreements with any Person to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is party, including any such
agreements or trusts (A) restricting the transfer of the capital stock or
other equity interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (B)
affecting the voting rights of capital stock or other equity or voting
securities or other equity interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (iv) outstanding or authorized equity or equity-based
compensation awards, including any equity appreciation rights, security-based
performance units, "phantom" stock, profit-participation or other security
rights issued by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character (contingent or otherwise) to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is party, in each case pursuant
to which any Person is entitled to receive any payment from the Company based
in whole or in part on the value of any capital stock or other equity or
voting securities or other equity interests of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) _Section 3.2(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement, each (i) Subsidiary of the Company and (ii) other
Person in whom the Company, directly or indirectly, owns any shares of capital
stock or other equity or voting securities or other equity interests, or any
securities or obligations convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for
such shares, securities or interests, in each case other than investments in
marketable securities and cash equivalents. The Company owns, beneficially and
of record, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding company,
partnership, corporate or similar (as applicable) ownership, voting or similar
interests in each of its Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens, and all
company, partnership, corporate or similar (as applicable) ownership, voting
or similar interests of each of the Subsidiaries are duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights. Except for the direct or

 



     

 

 



 

indirect Subsidiaries of the Company and investments in marketable securities
and cash equivalents, or as would not be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, none of the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries (i) owns directly or indirectly any shares of capital stock or
other equity or voting securities or other equity interests, or any securities
or obligations convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such
shares, securities or interests, in any Person or (ii) has any obligation or
has made any commitment to acquire any shares of capital stock or other equity
or voting securities or other equity interests in any Person or to provide
funds to or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution
or otherwise) in any Person.

Section 3.5 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 



 

(a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor

Section 3.6 _Company SEC Documents; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Since December 31, 2016, the Company has timely filed with (or furnished
to) the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements, exhibits and other
documents (including exhibits, financial statements and schedules thereto and
all other information incorporated therein and amendments and supplements
thereto) required by it to be filed (or furnished) under the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act (collectively, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of its
filing (or furnishing) date or, if amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment, each Company SEC
Document complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be. As of its filing
date or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the
last such amendment, each Company SEC Document filed pursuant to the Exchange
Act did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each Company SEC Document that is a registration
statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the
Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment became
effective prior to the date of this Agreement, did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein not
misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no amendments or
modifications to the Company SEC Documents that were required to be filed with
(or furnished to) the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, but that have
not yet been filed with (or furnished to) the SEC. No Subsidiary of the
Company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.
All of the audited financial statements and unaudited interim financial
statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents (i) comply in
all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and except,
in the case of the unaudited interim statements, as may be permitted under
Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act) and (iii) fairly present in all material
respects the financial position, the stockholders equity, the results of
operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as
of the times and for the periods referred to therein (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto and subject, in the case of unaudited interim
financial statements, to normal and recurring year-end adjustments).

 



     

 

 



 

(b) Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has furnished to Parent
complete and correct copies of all comment letters from the SEC since December
31, 2016 through the date of this Agreement with respect to any of the Company
SEC Documents, together with all written responses of the Company thereto. As
of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments
in comment letters received from the SEC staff with respect to any of the
Company SEC Documents, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, none of the
Company SEC Documents is subject to ongoing SEC review.

 



 

(c) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and governance
rules and regulations of Nasdaq.

 



 

(d) The Company maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act)
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the
Companys financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in conformity with GAAP. The Company has evaluated the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting and,
to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company
SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment
thereto its conclusions about the effectiveness of the internal control over
financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by such report or
amendment based on such evaluation. Based on the Companys most recent
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting prior to the date of
this Agreement, the Company has no "significant deficiencies" or "material
weaknesses" (as such terms are defined in Auditing Standard No. 5 of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement) in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information. Since December
31, 2016, there has been and is no fraud, whether or not material, that
involves senior management or other employees who have a significant role in
the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

 



 

(e) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that all
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications of the chief executive officer and
chief financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with
respect to such reports.

 



 

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, there
are no (i) SEC inquiries or investigations or (ii) other inquiries or
investigations by Governmental Authorities or internal investigations pending
or threatened, in each case regarding any accounting practices of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any malfeasance by any director or executive
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Since December 31, 2016
through the date of this Agreement, there have been no material internal
investigations regarding accounting, auditing or revenue recognition discussed
with, reviewed by or initiated at

 



     

 

 



 

the direction of the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief
accounting officer or general counsel of the Company, the Company Board or any
committee thereof.

 



 

(g) Each of the principal executive officer of the Company and the principal
financial officer of the Company (or each former principal executive officer

Article IV

 



 

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_**

 



 

Except (i) as disclosed in the particular section or subsection of the Parent
Disclosure Letter expressly referenced therein (it being understood and agreed
that any disclosure set forth in one section or subsection of the Parent
Disclosure Letter also shall be deemed to apply to each other section and
subsection of this Agreement to which its applicability is reasonably apparent
on its face from the text of such disclosure) or (ii) other than with respect
to _Section 4.1_, _Section 4.2_, _Section 4.3_, _Section 4.4_ and _Section
4.5_, as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed with (or furnished to)
the SEC by Parent on or after December 31, 2018 and at least one (1) Business
Day prior to the date of this Agreement (but in each case excluding any
disclosure contained under the heading "Risk Factors" (other than any factual
historical information contained therein) or in any "forward-looking

business as it is now being conducted and to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets in the manner in which its properties and assets are
currently operated, except where the failure to be so validly existing and
authorized has not been, and would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the character or location of the property owned, leased
or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. Accurate and complete copies of the Parent
Organizational Documents, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, have
been made

 



     

 

 



 

available to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement. The Parent

Section 4.6 _Parent SEC Documents; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) Since December 31, 2016, Parent has timely filed with (or furnished to)
the SEC all forms, reports, schedules, statements, exhibits and other
documents (including exhibits, financial statements and schedules thereto and
all other information incorporated therein and amendments and supplements
thereto) required by it to be filed (or furnished) under the Exchange Act or
the Securities Act (collectively, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of its
filing (or furnishing) date or, if amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment, each Parent SEC Document
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as the case may be. As of its filing date
or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last
such amendment, each Parent SEC Document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act
did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Each Parent SEC Document that is a registration
statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the
Securities Act, as of the date such registration statement or amendment became
effective prior to the date of this Agreement, did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein not
misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no amendments or
modifications to Parent SEC Documents that were required to be filed with (or
furnished to) the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, but that have not
yet been filed with (or furnished to) the SEC. No Subsidiary of Parent is
subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. All of the
audited financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements of
Parent included in Parent SEC Documents (i) comply in all material respects
with the applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto and except, in the case of
the unaudited interim statements, as may be permitted under Form 10-Q of the
Exchange Act) and (iii) fairly present in all material respects the financial
position, the stockholders equity, the results of operations and cash flows
of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the times and for the
periods referred to therein (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto
and subject, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements, to normal
and recurring year-end adjustments).

 



     

 

 



 

(b) Prior to the date of this Agreement, Parent has furnished to the Company
complete and correct copies of all comment letters from the SEC since December
31, 2016 through the date of this Agreement with respect to any of the Parent
SEC Documents, together with all written responses of Parent thereto. As of
the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in
comment letters received from the SEC staff with respect to any of Parent SEC
Documents, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, none of Parent SEC Documents are
subject to ongoing SEC review.

 



 

(c) Parent is in compliance in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and governance
rules and regulations of Nasdaq.

 



 

(d) Parent maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parents financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
conformity with GAAP. Parent has evaluated the effectiveness of Parents
internal control over financial reporting and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, presented in any applicable Parent SEC Document that is a
report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q or any amendment thereto its conclusions
about the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting as of
the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation. Based on the Parents most recent evaluation of internal control
over financial reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, Parent has no
"significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as such terms are defined
in Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board,
as in effect on the date of this Agreement) in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information. Since December 31, 2016, there has been and is no
fraud, whether or not material, that involves senior management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parents internal control over
financial reporting.

 



 

(e) Parent maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that all
information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that
all such information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial
officer of Parent required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports.

 



 

(f) To the Knowledge of Parent, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no
SEC inquiries or investigations, other inquiries or investigations by

(b) repurchase or otherwise acquire Parent Common Stock, unless in the

Section 5.3 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement; Company
Stockholders Meeting_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, (i) the Company (with Parents reasonable cooperation) shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form and (ii)
Parent (with the Companys reasonable

 



     

 

 



 

cooperation) shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in
connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (A) cause the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement to
comply with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, (B)
have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments from the
SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the Form S-4, take all action
reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in
connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the
Merger (the " _Parent Stock Issuance_ ") and (C) keep the Form S-4 effective
through the Closing Date in order to permit the consummation of the Merger.
Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information as may be
reasonably requested by the other in connection with any such action and the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement.
As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 shall have become
effective and the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments on the
Proxy Statement or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement
to be mailed to its stockholders. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to,
the Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company, in each case
without providing the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment (which comments shall be considered by the applicable party in good
faith) thereon if reasonably practicable; _provided_ that, without limiting
_Section 5.9_, with respect to documents filed by a party which are
incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, this right
to review and comment shall apply only with respect to information relating to
the other party or such other partys business, financial condition or results
of operations. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to Parent or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, should be discovered by Parent or the Company which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or
the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be prepared and, following a
reasonable opportunity for the other party (and its counsel) to review and
comment on such amendment or supplement, promptly filed with the SEC and, to
the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company. Subject to applicable Law, each party shall notify the other promptly
of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, of the issuance of any
stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of
the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments
or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or for additional
information and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence
between either party or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the
Form S-4 or the Merger.

 



 

(b) Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 7.1_, the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following
the effectiveness of

 



     

 

 



 

the Form S-4 and the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments on the
Proxy Statement or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement,
duly call, set a record date for, give notice of, convene (on a date selected
by the Company in consultation with Parent, which date shall be within,
subject to adjournment or postponement as provided below, sixty (60) days of
the effectiveness of the Form S-4) and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the
" _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") for the purpose of seeking the Company
Stockholder Approval, and shall submit such proposal to such holders at the
Company Stockholders Meeting and shall not submit any other proposal to such
holders in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting (other than an
advisory vote regarding merger-related compensation and a customary proposal
regarding adjournment of the Company Stockholders Meeting) without the prior
written consent of Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting without Parents prior written consent; _provided_ that
the Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (i) to
the extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement or Form S-4 required by Law is provided to the stockholders of the
Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company
Stockholders Meeting or (ii) if there are not sufficient affirmative votes in
person or by proxy at such meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company
Stockholders Meeting or to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval,
_provided_ that any such adjournment or postponement shall be for a period of
no more than an aggregate of fifteen (15) Business Days and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company shall not postpone the Company Stockholders
Meeting as contemplated by this clause (ii) if it would require a change to
the record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting. If the Company Board
has not made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with
_Section 5.6_, the Company shall, through the Company Board, make the Company
Recommendation, and shall include such Company Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement, and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and to secure
the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms, the obligations of the parties hereunder shall continue in full
force and effect.

Agreement, including the Merger; (iv) the defending of any lawsuits or other
Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
that would otherwise prevent or delay the consummation of the transactions

by each party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including
seeking to have any stay, temporary restraining order or injunction entered by
any court or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed; and (v) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments that are or may become
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, and to carry out fully
the purposes of this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall, in

reasonably practicable, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days after

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable, but
in no event later than as required by Law. Parent shall pay all filing fees
and other charges for the filings required under any Antitrust Law by the
Company and Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates will grant or offer to grant any
accommodation or concession (financial or otherwise), or make any payment, to
any third party (other than filing fees to any Governmental Authority) in
connection with seeking or obtaining its consent to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In connection with and without limiting the efforts referenced in _Section
5.4(a)_, each of the parties hereto will (i) furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with the preparation of any governmental filings, submissions or
other documents; (ii) give the other reasonable prior notice of any such
filing, submission or other document and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, of any communication with or from any Governmental Authority
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and permit the
other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views,
and secure the participation, of the other in connection with any such filing,
submission, document or communication; and (iii) cooperate in responding as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any investigation or other inquiry from
a Governmental Authority or in connection with any Proceeding initiated by a
Governmental Authority or private party, including informing the other party
as soon as practicable of any such investigation, inquiry or Proceeding, and
consulting in advance, to the extent practicable, before making any
presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, or, in connection
with any Proceeding initiated by a private party, to any other Person. In
addition, each of the parties hereto will give reasonable prior notice to and
consult with the other in advance of any meeting, conference or substantive
communication with any Governmental Authority, or, in connection with any
Proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and to the extent not
prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Authority or
other Person, and to the extent reasonably practicable, not participate or
attend any meeting or conference, or engage in any substantive communication,
with any Governmental Authority or such other Person in respect of the

reasonably designate material provided to the other party as "Outside Counsel
Only Material," and also may reasonably redact the material as necessary to

accordance with _Section 7.1_, it shall not, and shall ensure that none of
its Subsidiaries shall, consummate, enter into any agreement providing for, or
announce, any investment, acquisition, divestiture or other business
combination that would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company shall (and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford reasonable access to Parents
Representatives, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice,

information concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, and to provide copies thereof, as may reasonably be
requested; _provided_ that nothing herein shall require the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to disclose any information to Parent or Merger Sub if such
disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (a) violate
applicable Law or the provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party or (b) jeopardize any attorney-client or other
legal privilege; _provided_ , _further_ , that in each such case, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent to enable Parent and Parents Representatives to
enter into appropriate confidentiality, joint defense or similar documents or
arrangements so that Parent and Parents Representatives may have access to
such information. No investigation or access permitted pursuant to this
_Section 5.5_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company hereunder. All information

employees and other Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ shall be
kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

herein to the contrary, the parties hereby agree and acknowledge that the
restrictions in the Confidentiality Agreement shall not apply upon the
execution and delivery of this Agreement to the extent required to permit any
action contemplated hereby and in accordance herewith and solely until any
valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1_,
except as provided in _Section 5.6(b)_ or _Section 5.6(d)_, (i) the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries, and its and their respective officers
and directors to, immediately cease, and shall instruct and use its reasonable

which would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (B)
engage in negotiations or discussions with, or provide any non-public
information or non-public data to, any Person (other than Parent or any of its
Representatives) relating to or for the purpose of encouraging or
facilitating, any Acquisition Proposal or grant any waiver or release under
any standstill, confidentiality or other similar agreement (except that if the
Company Board determines in good faith that the failure to grant any waiver or
release would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law,
the Company may waive any such standstill provision in order to permit a third
party to make and pursue an Acquisition Proposal) or (C) resolve to do any of
the foregoing, (iii) the Company shall not provide and shall, within one (1)
Business Day of the date of this Agreement, terminate access of any third
party to any data room (virtual or actual) containing any information of the

date of this Agreement, the Company shall demand the return or destruction of
all confidential, non-public information and materials that have been provided
to third parties that have entered into confidentiality agreements relating to

since July 1, 2018.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.6(a)_, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company receives a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal from a third party that was not initiated, sought,
solicited, knowingly facilitated, knowingly encouraged, knowingly induced or
otherwise procured in violation of this Agreement, then the Company may (i)
contact the Person or any of its Representatives who has made such Acquisition
Proposal solely to clarify the terms of such Acquisition Proposal so that the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) may inform itself about such
Acquisition Proposal and to inform such Person or its Representatives of this
_Section 5.6_, (ii) furnish information concerning its business, properties
or assets to such Person or any of its Representatives pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement with confidentiality terms that, taken as a whole,
are not materially less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and (iii) negotiate and participate in discussions
and negotiations with such Person or any of its

 



     

 

 



 

Representatives concerning such Acquisition Proposal, in the case of clauses
(ii) and (iii), if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to constitute or
result in a Superior Proposal. The Company shall (A) promptly (and in any case
within twenty-four (24) hours) provide Parent notice (I) of the receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include a complete, unredacted copy
of all written proposals, written indications of interest or draft agreements
relating to, or other written materials that describe any of the terms and
conditions of, such Acquisition Proposal, and (II) of any inquiries, proposals
or offers received by, any requests for non-public information from, or any
discussions or negotiations initiated or continued (or sought to be initiated
or continued) with, the Company or any of its Representatives concerning an
Acquisition Proposal, and disclose the identity of the other party (or
parties) and the material terms of such inquiry, offer, proposal or request
and, in the case of written materials that describe any of the terms and
conditions of such inquiry, offer, proposal or request, provide copies of such
materials, (B) promptly (and in any case within twenty-four (24) hours) make
available to Parent all material non-public information, including copies of
all written materials, made available by the Company to such party but not
previously made available to Parent and (C) keep Parent informed on a
reasonably prompt basis (and, in any case, within twenty-four (24) hours of
any significant development) of the status and material details (including
material amendments and proposed material amendments) of any such Acquisition
Proposal or other inquiry, offer, proposal or request, providing to Parent
copies of any additional or revised written proposals, written indications of
interest or draft agreements relating to such Acquisition Proposal or other
inquiry, offer, proposal or request, or other written materials that describe
any of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or other
inquiry, offer, proposal or request. The Company agrees that it and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any Person that prohibits
the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this
_Section 5.6_.

 



 

(c) Except as permitted by _Section 5.6(d)_ or _Section 5.6(e)_, neither the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify,
or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, the Company
Recommendation, in each case in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, (ii)
approve, authorize, declare advisable or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or
(iii) adopt or approve, or publicly propose to adopt or approve, or allow the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any binding or
non-binding letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of
understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement,
joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement, commitment,
arrangement or understanding contemplating or otherwise in connection with, or
that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement permitted by
_Section 5.6(b)_) (any action described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii)
of this sentence being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ").

 



 

(d) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
the Company Board receives a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal
that was not initiated, sought, solicited, knowingly facilitated, knowingly
encouraged, knowingly induced or otherwise procured in violation of this
Agreement, the Company Board may (i) effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_ in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for such
Superior Proposal if, in each case, (A) the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (B) the Company has notified Parent
in writing that the Company Board intends to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 5.6(d)_ or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(i_i), (C) the Company has provided
Parent a copy of the proposed definitive agreements and other proposed
transaction documentation between the Company and the Person making such
Superior Proposal, if any, (D) for a period of four (4) Business Days
following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (B) of this _Section
5.6(d)_, the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good faith and
made the Companys Representatives available to discuss and negotiate in good
faith (in each case to the extent Parent takes action to or does negotiate)
with Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement so that the failure to take such action would no longer be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law
(it being understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term or
condition of any Superior Proposal shall require a new notice and a new
negotiation period that shall expire on the later to occur of (I) two (2)
Business Days following delivery of such new notice from the Company to Parent
and (II) the expiration of the original four (4)-Business Day period described
in clause (D) above), and (E) no earlier than the end of such negotiation
period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
and after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to
this Agreement, that (x) the Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the
notice described in clause (B) above still constitutes a Superior Proposal and
(y) the failure to take such action would still be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that any purported
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this sentence shall be void and of
no force and effect unless the Company shall have paid Parent the Termination
Fee in accordance with _Section 7.3(a)_ prior to or substantially
concurrently with such termination.

 



 

(e) Other than in connection with a Superior Proposal (which shall be subject
to _Section 5.6(d)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section 5.6(e)_),
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may, in
response to an Intervening Event, take any action prohibited by clause (i) of
_Section 5.6(c)_, only if (i) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (ii) the Company has notified Parent in
writing that the Company Board intends to effect such a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 5.6(e)_ (which notice shall
specify the facts and circumstances providing the basis of the Intervening
Event and for the Company Boards determination to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change in reasonable detail), (iii) for a period of four (4)
Business Days following the notice delivered pursuant to clause (ii) of this
_Section 5.6(e)_, the Company shall have discussed and negotiated in good
faith and made the Companys Representatives available to discuss and
negotiate in good faith (in each case to the extent Parent takes action to or
does negotiate) with Parents Representatives any proposed modifications to

no earlier than the end of such negotiation period, the Company Board shall

Section 5.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees that it will indemnify
and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and
the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, each current or former director and officer of the Company
(determined as of the Effective Time), in each case, when acting in such
capacity or in serving as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another entity or enterprise, including a Company Benefit Plan, at the request
or benefit of the Company (collectively, the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_")
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with, arising out of or otherwise related to any actual or alleged
Proceeding, in connection with, arising out of or otherwise related to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including actions to enforce
this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any DandO
Indemnified Party, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall also advance
expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and
the Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws in effect as of the date of
this Agreement; _provided_ that any Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
by final adjudication that such Person is not entitled to indemnification. For
a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect
the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses equivalent to the
provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any DandO

 



     

 

 



 

Indemnified Parties; _provided_ that all rights to indemnification in respect
of any claim made for indemnification within such period shall continue until
the disposition of such action or resolution of such claim. From and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall guarantee and stand surety for, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to honor, all indemnification Contracts between any
officer or director and the Company in effect prior to the date of this
Agreement that have been made available to Parent.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of or after the
Effective Time to, purchase a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy, with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
the coverage provided under the Companys existing policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance, with respect
to matters arising on or before the Effective Time (including in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions or actions contemplated by this
Agreement), and Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force
and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by the Surviving Corporation, and no other party shall have any
further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance hereunder; _provided_ that
the Company shall not pay, and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required
to pay, in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior
to the date of this Agreement in respect of such "tail" policy. If the Company
or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies prior to, as of or after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time;
_provided_ that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay
annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date of this Agreement in respect of the coverage
required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as
much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount.

 



 

(c) The covenants contained in this _Section 5.7_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Parties
and their respective heirs and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which any such Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract
or otherwise.

 



 

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7_.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Subject to applicable Law, the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event
whose occurrence or non-occurrence, as the case may be, would reasonably be
expected to cause, in the case of the Company, any condition set forth in
_Section 6.2_ not to be satisfied, or in the case of Parent, any condition
set forth in

 



     

 

 



 

 _Section 6.3_ not to be satisfied, at any time from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, (b) any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, if the subject matter of such notice or other
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent would
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent and (c) any claims, investigations or Proceedings
commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened in writing against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party (including its
board of directors) or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to this Agreement,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no such
notification shall, in and of itself, affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of
the parties hereunder.

neither Parent, nor the Company, nor any of their respective Affiliates, will
disseminate any press release or other public announcement or disclosure
concerning this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, except as may be required by Law or the rules of a national
securities exchange or to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4, without the prior consent of each of the other
parties hereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. The parties have agreed to the text of the joint press release
announcing the execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a)
without prior consent of the other parties, each party may disseminate
information substantially consistent with information included in a press
release or other document previously approved for external distribution by the
other parties, or is otherwise not subject to such approval, in each case,
pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 5.9_ and (b) this _Section
5.9_ shall not apply to (i) any press release or other public announcement or
disclosure in connection with any Company Adverse Recommendation Change
effected by the Company Board in accordance with this Agreement or (ii) any
press release or other public announcement or disclosure by the Company or
Parent of any information concerning this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in connection with a determination
or notice by the Company Board in accordance with _Section 5.6(b)_, _Section
5.6(d) _or _Section 5.6(e)_ or any dispute between the parties regarding this

Section 5.10 _Employee Benefits; Labor_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of this _Section 5.10_, (i) the term " _Covered Employees_ "
shall mean employees who are actively employed by or on a legally protected or
approved leave of absence from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii) the term " _Continuation
Period_ " shall mean the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on
the first anniversary of the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Except where applicable Law requires more favorable treatment, during the
Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary of
Parent to, provide to each Covered Employee for so long as such Covered
Employee remains an employee

 



     

 

 



 

of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries during the Continuation Period, (x) base
salary or base wage and target annual cash bonus opportunities, in the
aggregate, that are no less favorable than the base salary or base wage and
target annual cash bonus opportunities, in the aggregate, provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries to such Covered Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (y) pension and welfare benefits, in the aggregate, that
are no less favorable than the pension and welfare benefits, in the aggregate,
provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Covered Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) In the event that a Covered Employee experiences a Qualifying Termination
during the Continuation Period, such employee shall, no later than thirty (30)
days following such Qualifying Termination, be paid a bonus award for the
fiscal year during which such Qualifying Termination occurs under the annual
bonus plan in which such Covered Employee is participating as of the date of
such Qualifying Termination, based on target performance levels and prorated
for the portion of the fiscal year (based on calendar days) elapsed between
January 1 of the applicable fiscal year and the date of such Covered
Employees Qualifying Termination; _provided_ that any Covered Employee who is
otherwise entitled to receive a prorated bonus for such period under a
Severance Plan or otherwise will not be eligible to receive the prorated bonus
described in this _Section 5.10(c)_ in order to avoid duplication of
benefits.

 



 

(d) In the event any Covered Employee first becomes eligible to participate
under any Parent Benefit Plan following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the applicable Subsidiary of Parent to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive any preexisting condition exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to any Covered Employee (and eligible dependents) under any Parent
Benefit Plan providing medical, dental or vision benefits to the same extent
such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under any similar Company
Benefit Plan the Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to
coverage under the Parent Benefit Plan and (ii) provide each Covered Employee
with credit for any copayments, out-of-pocket requirements and deductibles
paid prior to the Covered Employees coverage under any Parent Benefit Plan
during the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs to the same extent
such credit was given under any similar Company Benefit Plan that the Covered
Employee (and eligible dependents) participated in immediately prior to
coverage under the Parent Benefit Plan, in satisfying any applicable co-
payment, deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Parent Benefit
Plan for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

 



 

(e) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall recognize, or shall cause the
applicable Subsidiary of Parent to recognize, all service of each Covered
Employee prior to the Effective Time, to the Company (or any predecessor
employer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the extent such service
with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary
under the comparable Company Benefit Plan) for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate, level of benefits and vesting, benefit accruals
(but not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit pension plan)
and for purposes of determining future vacation or paid time off accruals and
severance amounts to the same extent as such Covered Employee received,
immediately before the Effective Time, credit for such service under any
similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated

 



     

 

 



 

immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no event shall
anything contained in this _Section 5.10_ result in any duplication of
benefits for the same period of service.

 



 

(f) If requested by Parent no later than five (5) days prior to the Closing
Date, effective as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and
contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, the Company shall terminate or
cause the termination of each U.S. tax-qualified defined contribution plan
provided to current and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(each, a " _Company Qualified Plan_ "). In such event, prior to the Closing
Date and thereafter (as applicable), the Company and Parent shall take any and
all action as may be required, including amendments to a U.S. tax-qualified
defined contribution plan maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries
(each, a " _Parent Qualified Plan_ "), to permit each Covered Employee to make
rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) in cash and notes (representing plan
loans from the Company Qualified Plan) in an amount equal to the eligible
rollover distribution portion of the account balance distributable to such
Covered Employee from such Company Qualified Plan to the corresponding Parent
Qualified Plan. If the Company Qualified Plan is terminated as described
herein, the Covered Employees shall be eligible to participate in a Parent
Qualified Plan as soon as administratively practicable following the Closing
Date.

 



 

(g) Parent shall, or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary of Parent to, cause
each Covered Employee who has elected to participate in a flexible spending
plan maintained by the Company (the " _Company FSA_ ") for the plan year
during which the Closing occurs to be covered under a flexible spending plan
maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries (the " _Parent FSA_ ") at the
same level of coverage elected under the Company FSA. Each such Covered
Employee shall be treated as if his or her participation in the Parent FSA had
been continuous from the beginning of the plan year in which the Closing
occurs and each existing salary reduction election shall be taken into account
for the remainder of the plan year under the Parent FSA in which the Closing
occurs. The Parent FSA shall provide reimbursement for medical care expenses
and dependent care expenses incurred by Covered Employees at any time during
the plan year in which the Closing occurs under the Company FSA (including
claims incurred before the Closing), up to the amount of such Covered
Employees elections and reduced by amounts previously reimbursed by the
Company FSA.

 



 

(h) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the applicable
Subsidiary of Parent to, honor all contractual rights and employee benefit
obligations to current and former employees under the Company Benefit Plans
set forth on _Section 5.10(h)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. Parent
acknowledges that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
constitute a "change in control," "change of control" or term or concept of
similar import of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the terms of the
Company Benefit Plans.

 



 

(i) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 5.10_ with respect to employees, including Covered Employees,
of the Company and its Subsidiaries are included for the sole benefit of the
respective parties hereto and shall not create any right (i) in any other
Person, including employees, former employees, any participant or any
beneficiary thereof, in any Company Benefit Plan or (ii) to continued
employment with the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

 



     

 

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.10_ to the contrary, nothing in
this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment
or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan, Parent Benefit Plan or any
other employee benefit plans of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or shall prohibit
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates from amending or terminating any employee benefit plan.

acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
or will become subject to such reporting requirements with respect to Parent,

extent permitted by applicable Law.

Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable
best efforts, in accordance with applicable rules and policies of Nasdaq, to
facilitate the commencement of the delisting of the Company and of the shares
of Company Common Stock from Nasdaq as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not voluntarily
delist the Company Common Stock from Nasdaq.

 



 

Section 5.15 _State Takeover Laws_. If any state takeover statute becomes or
is deemed to become applicable to the Company or the Merger, the Voting
Agreement(s) or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then

as are permitted under applicable Law and necessary to eliminate or, if it is
not possible to eliminate, then to minimize the effects of such statutes on
the foregoing.

Company agrees that it shall not settle or offer to settle any such Proceeding
commenced prior to or after the date of this Agreement against the Company or
any of its directors or executive officers by any stockholder of the Company
relating to this Agreement, the Merger, any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Parent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

Section 5.17 _Resignations_. Prior to the Effective Time, upon Parents

to such termination or fraud in the making of the representations and
warranties set forth herein; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the

covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or (B) either Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ and in any
such case (I) after the execution of this Agreement and prior to such
termination (or prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting in the case of
termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_), an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been publicly disclosed (or, in the case of termination pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 7.1(d)(i)_, otherwise made known to the
Company Board) and not withdrawn (publicly, if publicly disclosed) and (II)
within twelve (12) months after such termination, any Acquisition Proposal is
consummated or the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal that is subsequently consummated ( _provided_ that
for purposes of this _Section 7.3(a)(i)_, the references to "fifteen percent
(15%)" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "fifty percent (50%)");

 



 

(ii) the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_; or

 



     

 

 



 

(iii) Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_;

 



 

then, in any such case, the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent
the Termination Fee.

 



 

Any payments required to be made under this _Section 7.3(a)_ shall be made
by wire transfer of same-day funds to the account or accounts designated by
Parent, (A) in the case of clause (i) above, on the same day as the
consummation of the Acquisition Proposal contemplated therein, (B) in the case
of clause (ii) above, immediately prior to or substantially concurrently with
such termination and (C) in the case of clause (iii) above, promptly, but in
no event later than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 



 

(c) The Company acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (ii) without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay the
Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the payment of the Termination Fee set forth in this _Section
7.3_, the Company shall pay Parent its costs and expenses in connection with
such suit (including reasonable attorneys fees), together with interest on
such amount at an annual rate equal to the prime rate as published in _The
Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made through the date such payment was actually received, or such lesser rate
as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto in writing at any time before or after receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ that after the Company Stockholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment that by
applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of any stock exchange requires
further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such further
approval of such stockholders nor any amendment or change not permitted under
applicable Law.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any agreement or condition contained herein. Any such
extension or waiver shall only be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of
any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "herewith" and
words of similar import shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. References to articles, sections,
paragraphs, exhibits, annexes and schedules are to the articles, sections and
paragraphs of, and exhibits, annexes and schedules to, this Agreement, unless
otherwise specified, and the table of contents and headings in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or

the phrase "without limitation." Words describing the singular number shall be
deemed to include the plural and vice versa, words denoting any gender shall

when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant
hereto unless otherwise defined therein. Any Law defined or referred to herein
or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to herein shall mean such

ordinary course of business in a manner consistent with the past practices" of
such Person.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority
to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto, except that

 



     

 

 



 

Merger Sub may assign any or all of its rights, interests and obligations
hereunder to one or more direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of
Parent, or a combination thereof so long as such assignment would not delay,
impair or prevent consummation of the Merger or otherwise have a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent and Parent continues to remain liable for all of such
obligations as if no such assignment had occurred. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective permitted successors and
assigns. Any attempted assignment in violation of this _Section 8.6_ shall be
null and void.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and appendices hereto), together with the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, constitutes
the entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

Section 8.8 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder except for the right of the Company to pursue damages
(including to the extent proven and awarded by the court, damages based on
loss of the economic benefit of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to the Companys stockholders, it being acknowledged that (i) prior
to the Effective Time, the stockholders of the Company shall not have the
right to assert directly any claim against Parent or Merger Sub or otherwise
enforce this Agreement and (ii) from and after the Effective Time, the
stockholders rights are governed by subsection (b) of the following proviso);
_provided_ that it is specifically intended that (a) the DandO Indemnified
Parties (solely with respect to _Section 5.7_ and this _Section 8.8_ from
and after the Effective Time) and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the
holders of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards (solely with respect
to _Article II_) are each intended third-party beneficiaries hereof.

 



 

Section 8.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all Proceedings (whether based
on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the actions of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company in the negotiation,
administration, performance and enforcement hereof, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

Section 8.10 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that any party hereto does not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that, prior to valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 7.1_, the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award

 



      

 

 



 

of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

(a) Each of the parties hereto hereby, with respect to any legal claim or
Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (i) expressly and irrevocably submits, for itself and with
respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court within the State of Delaware), (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to
deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave
from any such courts, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any claim or
Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement except in such courts and (iv) irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, and agrees not to assert, by way
of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any claim or Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a final and
nonappealable judgment in any Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

 



 

(b) Each party irrevocably consents to the service of process in any claim or
Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect
hereof brought by any other party hereto made by mailing copies thereof by
registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, to its address as specified in or pursuant to _Section 8.3_ and
such service of process shall be sufficient to confer personal jurisdiction
over such party in such claim or Proceeding and shall otherwise constitute
effective and binding service in every respect.

 



 

Section 8.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, all of which shall together be considered one and the same
agreement. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by
electronic transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a manually signed
counterpart of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,

ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
