STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS 

  

The following general terms and conditions shall be incorporated by reference
into the engagement letter dated December 11, 2009 between Overture
Acquisition Corporation and JPMorgan to which these terms are attached (the
"Engagement Letter"). Capitalized terms used below without definition shall
have the meanings assigned to them in the Engagement Letter and any references
herein to the "Agreement" shall mean the Engagement Letter together with
these Standard Terms and Conditions. 

   

 Section 1\. _Indemnification and Contribution._  

   

 (a) The Company agrees (i) to indemnify and hold harmless JPMorgan and its affiliates, and the respective directors, officers, agents, and employees of JPMorgan and its affiliates (JPMorgan and each such entity or person being referred to as an "Indemnified Person"), from and against any losses, claims, demands, damages or liabilities of any kind (collectively, "Liabilities") relating to or arising out of activities performed or services furnished pursuant to the Agreement, any Transaction or JPMorgans role in connection therewith, and (ii) to reimburse each Indemnified Person for all reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any investigative, administrative, judicial or regulatory action or proceeding in any jurisdiction related to or arising out of such activities, services, Transaction or role, whether or not in connection with pending or threatened litigation to which any Indemnified Person is a party, in each case as such expenses are incurred or paid. The Company will not, however, be responsible for any such Liabilities or expenses to the extent that they are finally judicially determined to have resulted primarily from JPMorgans bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Company also agrees that no Indemnified Person shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract, tort or otherwise) to the Company or any of its securityholders or creditors for or in connection with the Agreement, any Transaction or JPMorgans role or services in connection therewith, except to the extent that any such Liabilities or expenses incurred by the Company are finally judicially determined to have resulted primarily from JPMorgans bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. In no event shall the Company or any Indemnified Person be responsible for any special, indirect or consequential damages incurred by the other; provided that nothing in this sentence shall be deemed to (i) relieve the Company of any obligation it may otherwise have hereunder to indemnify an Indemnified Person for any such damages asserted by an unaffiliated third party or (ii) relieve JPMorgan of any liability it may otherwise have hereunder to the Company for any such damages which the Company becomes legally obligated to pay to an unaffiliated third party. 

   

 (b) The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any litigation or proceeding effected without its written consent. The Company will not, without JPMorgans written consent, settle, compromise, consent to the entry of any judgment in or otherwise seek to terminate any claim, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, whether or not any Indemnified Person is an actual or potential party thereto, unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of each Indemnified Person from any liabilities arising out of such claim, action or proceeding. If the Company enters into any agreement or arrangement with respect to, or effects, any proposed sale, exchange, dividend or other distribution or liquidation of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of transactions, the Company shall provide for the assumption of its obligations under this Section 1 by the purchaser or transferee of such assets or another party reasonably satisfactory to JPMorgan. 

   

 (c) If the foregoing indemnification is unavailable or insufficient to hold an Indemnified Person harmless in respect of any Liabilities (and related expenses) referred to therein then, in lieu of 
 

     ##### 

 

   

Overture Acquisition Corporation

indemnifying such Indemnified Person hereunder, the Company shall contribute
to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such
Liabilities (and related expenses) in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits to the Company, on the one hand, and JPMorgan,
on the other hand, of the Transaction (whether or not the Transaction is
consummated) and also the relative fault of each of the Company and JPMorgan,
as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that except to the extent that any such Liabilities or expenses
are finally judicially determined to have resulted primarily from JPMorgans
bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct, in no event shall the
Indemnified Persons be required to contribute an aggregate amount in excess
of the aggregate amount of fees actually received by JPMorgan under the
Engagement Letter. For the purposes of this Agreement, the relative benefits
to the Company and JPMorgan of the Transaction shall be deemed to be in the
same proportion as (i) the total value paid or contemplated to be paid or
received or contemplated to be received by the Company or its
securityholders, as the case may be, in connection with the Transaction or
Transactions that are the subject of the Engagement Letter, whether or not any
such Transaction is consummated, bears to (ii) the fees paid or to be paid to
JPMorgan under the Engagement Letter. 

   

 Section 2\. _Financial Advisory Role, Information, Reliance, Confidentiality, etc_. 

   

 (a) The Company understands that JPMorgan is acting solely as a financial advisor, is acting as an independent contractor and is not undertaking to provide any legal, accounting or tax advice in connection with its engagement under the Agreement and that JPMorgans role in any due diligence will be limited solely to performing such review as it shall deem necessary to support its own advice and analysis and shall not be on behalf of the Company. 

   

 (b) The Company agrees to provide to JPMorgan all information reasonably requested by JPMorgan for the purpose of its engagement under the Agreement and to provide reasonable access to employees and directors of the Company as JPMorgan requests. JPMorgan shall be entitled to rely upon and assume, without any obligation of independent verification, the accuracy and completeness of all information that is publicly available and of all information that has been furnished to it by the Company or any Counterparty or otherwise reviewed by JPMorgan, and JPMorgan shall not assume any responsibility or have any liability therefor. JPMorgan has no obligation to conduct any appraisal of any assets or liabilities or to evaluate the solvency of the Company or any Counterparty under any state or federal laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or similar matters. 

   

 (c) In order to enable JPMorgan to bring relevant expertise to bear on its engagement under the Agreement from among its global affiliates, the Company agrees that JPMorgan may share information obtained from the Company hereunder with its affiliates, and may perform the services contemplated hereby in conjunction with its affiliates, and that any JPMorgan affiliates performing services hereunder shall be entitled to the benefits and subject to the terms of the Agreement. The Company agrees that JPMorgan shall have the right to review and pre-approve any reference to it or its role as financial advisor under the Agreement in any public statement made by the Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld). 

   

 (d) JPMorgans financial advice is intended solely for the benefit and use of the senior management and the Board of Directors of the Company in considering a Transaction, is not on behalf of, and shall not confer rights or remedies upon, any shareholder or creditor of the Company or any other person, and may not be used or relied upon for any other purpose. Except as otherwise required by applicable law or governmental or stock exchange regulation, the Company will treat JPMorgans advice and the terms of the Agreement as confidential and will not disclose them to any third party (other than, on a confidential basis, to its counsel and other advisors in connection with a Transaction, it being understood that the Company will be responsible for any breach by such counsel or advisors of the provisions of this sentence) in any manner without JPMorgans prior written approval.

 (e) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Company and each of its employees, representatives or other agents may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. income and franchise tax treatment and the U.S. income and franchise tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses, if any) that are provided to the Company relating to such tax treatment and tax structure insofar as such treatment and/or structure relates to a U.S. income or franchise tax strategy, if any, provided to the Company by JPMorgan or its affiliates. 

   

 Section 3\. _Other Business Relationships_. 

   

 (a) You understand that JPMorgan and its affiliates (collectively, "Morgan") comprise a full service securities firm and a commercial bank engaged in securities trading and brokerage activities, as well as providing investment banking, asset management, financing, and financial advisory services and other commercial and investment banking products and services to a wide range of corporations and individuals. In the ordinary course of our trading, brokerage, asset management, and financing activities, Morgan may at any time hold long or short positions, and may trade or otherwise effect transactions, for our own account or the accounts of customers, in debt or equity securities or senior loans of any Counterparty, the Company or any other company that may be involved in the Transaction. Morgan recognizes its responsibility for compliance with federal securities laws in connection with such activities. 

   

 (b) In addition, Morgan may have and may in the future have investment and commercial banking, trust and other relationships with parties other than the Company, which parties may have interests with respect to the Company, any Counterparty or a Transaction. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees that, in agreeing to provide the advisory services contemplated by the Agreement, JPMorgan reserves the right of Morgan to pursue opportunities to arrange and/or provide new financing to other potential parties to an acquisition or business combination transaction involving any Counterparty specifically in connection with such transaction. The Company acknowledges its understanding that the interests of Morgan in its capacity as arranger and/or provider of financing to other potential parties in respect of a transaction involving any Counterparty may differ from those of the Company with respect to the timing, pricing and terms and conditions of a Transaction or any such alternative acquisition or business combination transaction and otherwise, and the Company expressly waives any conflicts of interest which may result from JPMorgans multiple roles as advisor to the Company hereunder and as an arranger and/or provider (or an affiliate to such an arranger or provider) of financing to other potential parties to a transaction involving any Counterparty. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, during the term of the Agreement, Morgan shall not act as MandA financial advisor to any party (other than the Company) in connection with a Transaction or any other acquisition or business combination transaction involving any Counterparty with respect to which JPMorgan has agreed to advise the Company (as contemplated by the opening paragraph of the Engagement Letter). Although Morgan in the course of its other relationships described above may acquire information about the Transaction, any Counterparty or such other parties, Morgan shall have no obligation to disclose such information, or the fact that Morgan is in possession of such information, to the Company or to use such information on the Companys behalf. Furthermore Morgan may have fiduciary or other relationships whereby Morgan may exercise voting power over securities of various persons, which securities may from time to time include securities of the Company, any Counterparty or others with interests with respect to a Transaction. The Company acknowledges that Morgan may exercise such powers and otherwise perform its functions in connection with such fiduciary or other relationships without regard to its relationship to the Company hereunder. 

   

 Section 4\. _Miscellaneous_. The Agreement may not be assigned by the Company or JPMorgan without the prior written consent of the other. The Agreement constitutes the entire 

     ##### 

  

     

Overture Acquisition Corporation

understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter thereof,
supersedes all prior agreements with respect thereto, may not be amended
except in writing signed by both of the parties, has been duly authorized and
executed by each of the parties hereto and constitutes the legal,
binding obligation of each such party. The Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without
reference to principles of conflicts of law. Each of the Company and JPMorgan
irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
and venue of any State or Federal court sitting in New York City over any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each
of the Company and JPMorgan irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
objection to the laying of venue of any such action brought in any such court
and any claim that any such action has been brought in an inconvenient Forum.
JPMorgan and the Company (on its own behalf and, to the extent permitted by
law, on behalf of its shareholders) each waives any right to trial by jury
in any action, claim, suit or proceeding with respect to JPMorgans
engagement as financial advisor under the Agreement or its role in connection
herewith.
