with the SEC. As of their respective dates (or, if amended or superseded by a
subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such subsequent
filing), the Parent SEC Reports complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, as amended and the rules and regulations thereunder (the
"Sarbanes-Oxley Act") as the case may be, and none of the Parent SEC Reports
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Since January 1, 2017, (i) Parent has been in compliance with
the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of
NASDAQ, except, in each case, where the failure to so comply would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Parent and
its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (ii) each of the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of Parent has made all certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the Parent SEC Documents, and
the statements contained in such certifications are accurate, except, in each
case, where the failure to make such certifications or to be so accurate would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on
Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(ii) The financial statements of Parent (including any related notes and
schedules thereto) included in the Parent SEC Reports complied, as of their
respective dates of filing with the SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a
subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such subsequent
filing), in all material respects with all applicable accounting requirements,
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and with the rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
disclosed therein and, in the case of the unaudited



11



US-DOCS\\\100678152.13

* * *



financial statements, as permitted by the SEC), and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
subsidiaries and the consolidated results of operations, changes in
stockholders' equity and cash flows of such companies as of the dates and for
the periods shown.

(h) Litigation. Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to
the date of this Agreement, as of the date hereof, there is no claim, action
or proceeding pending, or to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against
Parent any of its subsidiaries by or before any Governmental Authority or by
or on behalf of any other third party, which, if adversely determined, would
have a material adverse effect on Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date
of this Agreement, as of the date hereof, none of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries is subject to, and to the Knowledge of Parent, there is not
threatened, any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority in
respect of the business or any of the assets, rights or properties of Parent
or its subsidiaries, except for those that would not have a material adverse
effect to Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(i) Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of
50,000,000 shares of Parent Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, $0.01 par value per share. As of March 31, 2018, there were (i)
25,911,868 shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding (and zero shares of
Parent Common Stock held in treasury), (ii) zero shares of preferred stock
outstanding, (iii) options granted under Parent's equity incentive plans to
purchase an aggregate of 322,288 shares of Parent Common Stock, (iv) 413,426
shares of Parent Common Stock underlying time-based restricted stock awards,
and (v) 347,803 shares of Parent Common Stock underlying performance stock
awards (assuming achievement of the target level of performance at the end of
the applicable performance period) and, except for (A) the foregoing, (B) in
connection with the Financing, or (C) as otherwise disclosed in the documents
publicly filed by Parent prior to the date hereof with the SEC, there are no
other agreements, options, warrants, calls, rights or other instruments or
agreements relating to the sale, issuance, redemption or voting of any equity
interests or other shares of capital stock of Parent, or any securities or
other instruments convertible into, exchangeable for, evidencing the right to
purchase, or otherwise requiring Parent to make a payment or otherwise provide
value or benefits in respect of the value of, any equity interests or other
shares of capital stock of Parent.

4. Other Agreements.

4.1 Lock-Up. Each Seller hereby agrees that for a period commencing on the
Closing Date and ending on the date that is 165 days after the Closing Date,
it shall not, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, contract to sell, transfer,
pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose
of any shares of Parent Common Stock received by such Seller as Stock
Consideration; provided, that, on the 105th day following the Closing Date,
such limitations shall expire with respect to 50% of the shares of Parent
Common Stock received by such Seller as Stock Consideration (such 165-day
period and 105-day period, the "Lock-Up Period"); provided, that, in the event
the End Date (as defined below) is extended in accordance with the terms of
Section 5.18(b), the Lock-Up Period shall be reduced, on a day-for-day basis,
for each day after the original End Date that Closing does not occur, up to a
maximum of 15 days. For the avoidance of doubt, in



12



US-DOCS\\\100678152.13

* * *



no event shall the Lock-Up Period be reduced by more than 15 days, such that
the minimum Lock-Up Period is a period of 150 days and 90 days, respectively.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, JCF III Europe S.a r.l. shall be permitted to
transfer the shares of Parent Common Stock it receives as Stock Consideration
to JCF III Europe Holdings LP and Parent shall cooperate in good faith
(including providing instructions to AST) to enable such transfer to occur as
soon as reasonably practicable on or after the Closing Date, as either Seller
may request. Sellers will not make any public announcement regarding any such
transfer to JCF III Europe Holdings LP unless required by applicable
Regulation and, if so required, any such announcement will include a statement
that the shares of Parent Common Stock held JCF III Europe Holdings LP,
including any such shares that are transferred, remain subject to the transfer
restrictions set forth in this Section 4.1.

4.2 Registration of Parent Common Stock.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 4.2, no later than 105
days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to become effective with the
SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 (the "Resale Registration Statement")
to register the resale of the shares of Parent Common Stock delivered as Stock
Consideration (together with (i) shares of Parent Common Stock delivered as
stock consideration under the Management SPA) and (ii) any securities into
which the Parent Common Stock may be converted or exchanged pursuant to any
merger, consolidation, sale of all or any part of its assets, corporate
conversion or other extraordinary transaction of Parent, the "Registrable
Securities") and providing for the sale of such Registrable Securities from
time to time pursuant to such method of distribution as the holders of such
Registrable Securities may from time to time elect. Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Resale Registration Statement to
be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable and to keep such Resale Registration Statement continuously
effective for a period from the date of its initial effectiveness until the
earlier of three years after the Closing Date and such time as there are no
Registrable Securities outstanding (such date, the "Registration Rights
Termination Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent shall furnish to
the holders of Registrable Securities a certificate signed by an officer
stating that the filing, effectiveness or continued use of the Resale
Registration Statement would require Parent to make an Adverse Disclosure,
Parent shall be permitted to delay the effectiveness or continued use of the
Resale Registration Statement to the extent reasonably necessary; provided,
that (i) the length of any deferral shall not exceed 45 days and (ii) Parent
shall not invoke its right more than once in any 12-month period; and provided
that Parent may exercise this right or the right set forth in the last
sentence of Section 4.2(b)(i) but not both during such 12-month period.

(b) Underwritten Offerings.

(i) Following the effectiveness of the Resale Registration Statement, Parent
shall conduct one or more underwritten resales of Registrable Securities (an
"Underwritten Shelf Take-Down") upon the written request of one or more
holders of Registrable Securities with an aggregate value of $50,000,000 or
more, which Underwritten Shelf Take-Down may be in the form of a block trade
or overnight deal. Upon receipt of any such request, Parent shall promptly
(but in no event later than five business days following receipt thereof)
deliver notice of such request to all other holders of Registrable Securities
who shall then have five business days



13



US-DOCS\\\100678152.13

* * *



from the date such notice is given to notify Parent in writing of their desire
to be included in such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down. The sole or managing
underwriters and any additional investment bankers and managers to be used in
connection with an Underwritten Shelf Take-Down shall be selected by the
holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities included in such
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, subject to the prior written consent of Parent,
such consent to not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The holders of a
majority of the Registrable Securities included in such Underwritten Shelf
Take-Down shall also have the right to determine the plan of distribution and
select counsel for such holders. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in no event shall holders be entitled to effect an Underwritten
Shelf Take-Down (x) unless the aggregate gross proceeds expected to be
received from the sale of Registrable Securities in such Underwritten Shelf
Take-Down are at least $50,000,000 and (y) on more than three occasions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parent shall furnish to the holders of
Registrable Securities a certificate signed by an officer stating that any
such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down would require Parent to make an Adverse
Disclosure, Parent shall be permitted to delay such Underwritten Shelf Take-
Down to the extent reasonably necessary; provided, that (i) the length of any
deferral shall not exceed 45 days and (ii) Parent shall not invoke its right
more than once in any 12-month period; and provided that Parent may exercise
this right or the right set forth in the last sentence of Section 4.2(a) but
not both during such 12-month period.

(ii) If requested by the sole or lead managing underwriter for any
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, Parent shall enter into a customary underwriting
agreement with the underwriters for such offering reasonably acceptable to the
holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities, containing such
representations and warranties by Parent and such other terms as are customary
in agreements of that type, including, without limitation, customary
indemnification obligations of Parent.

(iii) The holders participating in an Underwritten Shelf Take-Down shall be
party to the underwriting agreement between Parent and such underwriters and
may, at the option of the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities
participating in such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, require that any or all of
the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part
of, Parent to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be made to
and for the benefit of such holders and that any or all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting
agreement be conditions precedent to the obligations of such holders;
provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to make any
representations or warranties with respect to written information provided by
such holders expressly for inclusion in the Resale Registration Statement. No
such holder shall be required to make any representations or warranties to, or
agreements with, Parent or the underwriters other than representations,
warranties or agreements regarding such holder, such holder's Registrable
Securities and such holder's intended method of disposition.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no holder may
participate in any Underwritten Shelf Take-Down or Company Offering (as
defined below) hereunder unless such holder (A) agrees to sell its securities
on the terms and conditions provided in any underwriting agreement pertaining
to such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down in accordance with Section 4.2(b)(ii) or
Company Offering in accordance with Section 4.2(c)(i) and (B) accurately



14



US-DOCS\\\100678152.13

* * *



completes and executes in a timely manner all questionnaires, powers of
attorney, custody agreements, lock-up agreements, underwriting agreements and
other documents reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting
arrangements; provided that any such lock-up period shall not be longer than
90 days after the date of the final prospectus (or final prospectus
supplement) pursuant to which such Underwritten Shelf Take-Down was made;
provided further, any such holder shall only be subject to a lock-up if the
directors and officers of Parent are subject to a lock-up and the length of
such lock-up for such holder shall be no longer than the shortest lock-up of
any such directors and officers.

(c) Piggyback Rights.

(i) Following the effectiveness of the Resale Registration Statement, if
Parent proposes to pursue an underwritten offering ("Company Offering")
(whether proposed to be offered for sale by Parent or by any other stockholder
of Parent) under the Securities Act (other than a registration on Form S-4 or
S-8, or any successor or other forms promulgated for similar purposes) it will
give prompt written notice (which notice shall specify the intended method or
methods of disposition) to the holders of Registrable Securities of its
intention to do so and of such holder's rights under this Section 4.2(c). Upon
the written request of any holder made within five business days after the
receipt of any such notice (which request shall specify the number of
Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such holder), Parent
will, subject to clause (ii) below and (b)(iv) above, include the Registrable
Securities of such holder in the Company Offering; provided that: (A) if, at
any time after giving written notice of its intention to pursue a Company
Offering and prior to the pricing of the offering, Parent shall determine for
any reason not to proceed with the proposed offering of the securities to be
sold by it, Parent may, at its election, give written notice of such
determination to the holders and, thereupon, Parent shall be relieved of its
obligation to include any Registrable Securities in such offering (but not
from its obligation to pay the Registration Expenses incurred in connection
therewith); and (B) the holders of Registrable Securities requesting to be
included in the Company Offering must, upon the written request of Parent,
sell their Registrable Securities to the underwriters on the same terms and
conditions as apply to the other securities being sold through underwriters
under such registration, with, in the case of a combined primary and secondary
offering, only such differences, including any with respect to representations
and warranties, indemnification and liability insurance, as may be customary
or appropriate in combined primary and secondary offerings.

(ii) If a registration pursuant to this Section 4.2(c) involves an
underwritten offering and the managing underwriter advises Parent in writing
(a copy of which shall be provided to the holders of Registrable Securities)
that, in its opinion, the number of Registrable Securities and other
securities requested to be included in such offering exceeds the number which
can be sold in such offering, so as to be likely to have a material and
adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the securities offered
in such offering, then Parent will include in such registration: (i) first,
the securities Parent proposes to sell for its own account; and (ii) second,
such number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in such
offering which, in the opinion of such managing underwriter, can be sold
without having the material and adverse effect referred to above, which number
of Registrable Securities shall be allocated pro rata among the Registrable
Securities held by all such requesting holders. Any other selling holders of
Parent's securities (other



15



US-DOCS\\\100678152.13

* * *



than transferees to whom a holder has assigned its rights under this
Agreement) will be included in an underwritten offering only with the consent
of holders holding a majority of the shares being sold in such offering.
Parent will pay all Registration Expenses in connection with each offering of
Registrable Securities pursuant to this Section 4.2(c).

(d) Until the Registration Rights Termination Date, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts:

(i) to promptly prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements
to the Resale Registration Statement, and the prospectus contained in such
Resale Registration Statement, as may be necessary to comply with the
Securities Act with respect to the disposition of the Registrable Securities;

(ii) to furnish to each holder of Registrable Securities such number of copies
of the prospectus included in the Resale Registration Statement (and each
supplement thereto) as may be required by the Securities Act to permit resales
of the Registrable Securities (whether physically or through compliance with
Rule 172 under the Securities Act or any similar rule);

(iii) during the period when a prospectus is required to be delivered under
the Securities Act in connection with the resale of Registrable Securities, to
notify each holder of Registrable Securities: (A) when the Resale Registration
Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto has become effective; (B) of
any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Resale
Registration Statement or the prospectus included therein; (C) of the issuance
by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of Resale
Registration Statement; (D) of the receipt by Parent of any notification with
respect to the suspension of the qualification of Parent Common Stock for sale
in any jurisdiction; or (E) of any event as a result of which the prospectus
included in the Resale Registration Statement (as amended or supplemented)
includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading in light of the circumstances then existing;

(iv) to remain eligible to use Form S-3;

(v) to furnish to any selling holder draft copies of the Resale Registration
Statement or any prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto proposed
to be filed a reasonable time prior to such filing to allow such holder
adequate time to review and provide reasonable comment thereon;

(vi) to qualify (or exempt) the Registrable Securities for offer and sale
under such other securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions in the
United States as the selling holders or underwriter, if any, reasonably
request; keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom)
effective until the Registration Rights Termination Date; provided that Parent
will not be required to (A) qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this
clause (vi), (B) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (C)
consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not
then so subject;



16



US-DOCS\\\100678152.13

* * *



(vii) to the extent not already so listed (or authorized to be listed), to
cause the Registrable Securities included in the Resale Registration Statement
to be listed on each securities exchange, if any, on which similar securities
issued by Parent are then listed;

(viii) to make available for inspection by the selling holders, any sole or
lead managing underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such
Resale Registration Statement and any attorney, accountant or other agent
retained by the selling holders, or any underwriter, all financial and other
records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of Parent and any
subsidiaries thereof as may be in existence at such time as shall be
necessary, in the advice of the holders' and such underwriters' respective
counsel, to enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility and to
conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of the Securities Act,
and cause Parent's and any subsidiaries' or officers, directors and employees,
and the independent public accountants of Parent, to supply all information
reasonably requested by any of the foregoing in connection with such Resale
Registration Statement;

(ix) in connection with an Underwritten Shelf Take-Down or Company Offering,
to obtain an opinion and negative assurance statements from its counsel dated
the date of the closing under the underwriting agreement and a "comfort"
letter from its independent public accountants who have certified Parent's
financial statements included or incorporated by reference in such Resale
Registration Statement dated the date of the prospectus that is part of such
Resale Registration Statement (and if such registration involves and
Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, dated the date of the closing under the
underwriting agreement), in customary form and covering such matters as are
customarily covered by such opinions, negative assurance statements and
"comfort" letters delivered to underwriters in underwritten public offerings,
which opinion and letter shall be reasonably satisfactory to the sole or lead
managing underwriter and addressed to the underwriters;

(x) to cooperate with the selling holders and the sole or lead managing
underwriter, if any, to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of
certificates not bearing any restrictive legends representing the Registrable
Securities to be sold, and cause such Registrable Securities to be issued in
such denominations and registered in such names in accordance with the
underwriting agreement prior to any sale of Registrable Securities to the
underwriters or, if not an Underwritten Shelf Take-Down, in accordance with
the instructions of the selling holders at least three business days prior to
any sale of Registrable Securities;

(xi) to take all reasonable actions to ensure that any Free Writing Prospectus
(as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act) utilized in connection with any
offering hereunder complies in all material respects with the Securities Act,
is filed in accordance with the Securities Act to the extent required thereby,
is retained in accordance with the Securities Act to the extent required
thereby and, when taken together with the related prospectus, will not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading;

(xii) in connection with any block trade or other underwritten offering, to
issue such press releases (e.g., launch and pricing press releases) as may be
customary for such an offering; and



17



US-DOCS\\\100678152.13

* * *



(xiii) to make any filings required to be made with FINRA.

(e) Parent shall notify each holder of Registrable Securities in writing if
the Resale Registration Statement or prospectus contained therein contains an
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and upon receipt of such notice, each such holder of Registrable
Securities shall, forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities
pursuant to the Resale Registration Statement until such holder of has
received copies of a supplemented or amended prospectus from Parent, or until
such holder is advised in writing by Parent that the use of such prospectus is
permitted.

(f) All registration expenses ("Registration Expenses") incurred in effecting
any registration hereunder shall be borne by Parent, including (i)
registration and filing fees with the SEC and the FINRA with respect to
registering the Registrable Securities, (ii) fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the listing or quotation of the Registrable Securities, (iii)
fees and expenses of compliance with securities or blue sky laws (including
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel in connection with blue sky

any additional experts retained by Parent in connection with such registration
and (vii) aggregate fees and expenses (not to exceed $50,000) of not more than
one law firm (as selected by holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities (including holders of Registrable Securities under the Management
SPA) included in such registration) incurred by the selling holders in
connection with the registration. The expenses of any underwriters,
underwriting discounts or commissions or any broker's fees or other similar
selling fees attributable to the sale of Registrable Securities shall be borne
by such participating holder of Registrable Securities.

(g) Sellers shall not use any free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405
under the Securities Act) in connection with the sale of Registrable
Securities without the prior written consent of Parent.

(h) It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of Parent to register
Registrable Securities of Sellers under this Section 4.2 that such Seller

Securities held by it, and the intended method of disposition of such
securities as shall be reasonably required to effect the registration of such
Registrable Securities.

(i) The registration rights under this Section 4.2 may not be assigned by
Sellers, except to (i) any direct or indirect partner or member of Sellers to
whom Registrable Securities are distributed and/or (ii) any affiliate of

selling securityholders thereunder in any 30-day period.

(j) In connection with any sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Resale Registration Statement:

(i) Without limiting, and in addition to, any indemnification agreement of
Parent set forth in any underwriting agreement entered into in accordance with
Section 4.2(b)(ii), Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each holder of
Registrable Securities, the partners, members, officers and directors of each
holder of Registrable Securities and each person, if any, who controls such
holder of Registrable Securities within the meaning of the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, against: (A) any untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the Resale Registration Statement, including any preliminary
prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or
supplements thereto; (B) the omission to state in the Resale Registration
Statement a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading; or (C) any violation by Parent of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any federal or state securities law or any
rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or
any federal or state securities law in connection with the Resale Registration
Statement; provided, however, Parent shall not be liable in any such case for
any such expense, loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the extent that
it arises out of or is based upon actions or omissions made in reliance upon
and in conformity with information furnished by or on behalf of a holder of
Registrable Securities, or any member, partner, officer or director or
controlling person of a holder of Registrable Securities for use in connection
with such registration by such holder, partner, officer, director or
controlling person.

(ii) Each holder of Registrable Securities shall indemnify, severally and not
jointly, and hold harmless Parent, each of its directors, each of its officers
who have signed the Resale Registration Statement, each person, if any, who
controls Parent within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act,
and any other holder of Registrable Securities or any of such holder's
members, partners, directors or officers or any person who controls such
holder within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against
any expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) to
which any of the foregoing persons may become subject arising out of or based
upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
the Resale Registration Statement, including any preliminary prospectus or
final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto,
in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such untrue or
alleged untrue statement is contained in, or such omission or alleged omission
is required to be contained in, any information which (i) relates solely to
such holder's individual ownership of the Registrable Securities, (ii) is
furnished in writing to Parent by such holder solely in its capacity as a
holder of Registrable Securities, expressly for use in such Resale
Registration Statement and (iii) that such statement or omission was relied
upon by Parent in preparation of such Resale Registration Statement; and each
such holder shall reimburse Parent and such other persons for any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided,
however, that such holder of Registrable Securities shall not be liable in any
such case to the extent that the holder has furnished in writing to Parent
within a reasonable period of time prior to the filing of the Resale
Registration Statement or amendment or supplement thereto information
expressly for use in such Resale Registration Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto which corrected or made not misleading, information
previously furnished to Parent, and Parent failed to include such



19



US-DOCS\\\100678152.13

* * *



information therein. In no event shall the liability of any selling holder of
Registrable Securities hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount
of the proceeds (net of payment of all expenses) received by such holder upon
the sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification
obligation.

(iii) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 4.2(h)
of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental
action) for which a party may be entitled to indemnification under this
Section 4.2(h), such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is
to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 4.2(h), deliver
to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof, and
the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in such action and,
to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other
indemnifying party to which notice has been given, to assume the defense
thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnifying and
indemnified parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party (together
with all other indemnified parties that may be represented without conflict by
one counsel) shall have the right to retain one counsel (in addition to
reasonably necessary local counsel), with the reasonable fees and expenses
thereof to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such
indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such
indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such
proceeding or if there may be one or more defenses available to such
indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available to
the indemnifying parties. The failure to deliver written notice to the
indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the commencement of any such
action, shall not relieve such indemnifying party of liability to the
indemnified party under this Section 4.2(h) except to the extent (and only to
the extent) that the indemnifying party has been actually prejudiced by such
delay.

(iv) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution to joint
liability under the Securities Act in any case in which either (A) any party
otherwise entitled to indemnification hereunder makes a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 4.2(h) but it is judicially
determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent
jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last
right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case
notwithstanding the fact that this Section 4.2(h) provides for indemnification
in such case, or (B) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on
the part of any party hereto for which indemnification is provided under this
Section 4.2(h); then, and in each such case, such parties will contribute to
the aggregate expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which they
may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party in connection with the Violation that resulted in such
expense, loss, claim, damage or liability as well as other equitable
considerations. The relative fault of such parties shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue
statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission of a material
fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or indemnified
party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and

counterpart or a copy of this Section 5.7 with any court as written evidence

5.8 Arbitration.

(a) The parties hereto mutually agree to final and binding arbitration of all
disputes, claims or causes of action arising out of or related to this
Agreement, including any question regarding its existence, validity, or
termination, and any question as to whether a particular dispute is arbitrable
hereunder, shall be referred to and finally resolved by binding arbitration
administered by the ICC and conducted pursuant to the ICC Rules by three
arbitrators appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules. The place of
arbitration shall be New York, New York and the language to be used in the
arbitral proceedings shall be English. Judgment upon the award may be entered
by any court having jurisdiction thereof, including any court outside the
United States. The parties hereby waive in any legal proceedings concerning or
arising out of any such arbitration, including without limitation, proceedings
to compel any Ancillary Proceeding, any defense of lack of personal
jurisdiction or forum non conveniens or other similar doctrine. Without
limitation, the parties hereby consent to the jurisdiction of the courts
sitting in the place of arbitration in connection with any Ancillary
Proceedings. The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to grant interim
measures in accordance with the ICC Rules. Any party to the arbitration shall
bear its own costs and expenses (including all attorneys' fees and expenses,
except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law) and all costs and
expenses of the arbitration proceeding (such as filing fees, the arbitrator's
fees, hearing expenses, etc.) shall be borne equally by the parties. The
arbitrator has the authority only to award the equitable relief, damages,
costs and fees that would have been available to a party had the dispute(s),
claim(s) or cause(s) of action been litigated in court under the applicable
law specified in this Agreement. This Agreement, and the decision and award of
the arbitrator, may be enforced by a court of competent jurisdiction, and the
parties may assert this Agreement as a defense in any proceeding.

authority to make any decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award or other
determination that does not conform to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (as executed and delivered by the parties hereto) and (ii) the
arbitrator shall have no greater authority to award any relief than a court
having proper jurisdiction. The Arbitration Information shall be kept
confidential by the parties subject to Section 5.6, and any appeal from or
motion to vacate or confirm such decision, judgment, ruling, finding, award or
other determination shall be filed under seal.

(c) In the event that either party or any of such party's affiliates,
associates or representatives is requested or required (by oral question or
request for information or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory,
subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any
Arbitration Information (the "Disclosing Party"), to the extent permitted by
applicable Regulation, such Disclosing Party shall notify the other party
promptly of the request or requirement so that the other party may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions hereof.
If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder,
the Disclosing Party or any of its affiliates, associates or representatives
believes in good faith, upon the advice of legal counsel, that it is compelled
to disclose any such Arbitration Information, such



31

* * *



Disclosing Party may disclose such portion of the Arbitration Information as
it believes in good faith, upon the advice of legal counsel, it is required to
disclose; provided, that the Disclosing Party shall use reasonable efforts to
obtain, at the request and expense of the other party, an order or other
assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to such portion of the
Arbitration Information required to be disclosed as such other party shall
designate. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties shall
have no obligation to keep confidential any Arbitration Information that
becomes generally known to and available for use by the public other than as a
result of the Disclosing Party's acts or omissions or the acts or omissions of
such party's affiliates, associates or representatives.

(d) The arbitration requirement does not limit the right of either party to
obtain provisional or ancillary remedies, such as injunctive relief,
attachment or the appointment of a receiver, before, during or after the
pendency of any arbitration proceeding. This exclusion does not constitute a
waiver of the right or obligation of either party to submit any dispute to
arbitration or reference hereunder.

(e) To the maximum extent practicable, the ICC, the arbitrator and the parties
shall take all action required to conclude any arbitration proceeding within
180 days of the filing of the dispute with the ICC. If more than one agreement
for arbitration among the parties potentially applies to a dispute, the
arbitration provision most directly related to this Agreement or the subject
matter of the dispute shall control. This arbitration provision shall survive
termination, amendment or expiration of this Agreement or any relationship
among the parties.

5.9 Counterparts; Electronic Signatures. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The parties agree
that this Agreement shall be legally binding upon the electronic transmission,
including by email, by each party of a signed signature page to this Agreement
to the other party.

5.10 Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall inure to
the benefit of, and be binding upon, each of the parties hereto and each of
their respective legal representatives, heirs, legatees, distributees, and
permitted assigns, whether or not any such person shall have become a party to
this Agreement and have agreed in writing to join herein and be bound by the
terms and conditions hereof.

5.11 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obligations
under this Agreement may be assigned by any party hereto without the prior
written consent of Sellers (in the case of an assignment by Parent or
Purchaser) or Purchaser (in the case of an assignment by any Seller, the
Company or Holdings) ("Assignee").

5.12 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this
Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any
other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually

acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

5.13 No Third-Party Benefits. Other than Section 4.2 (which is for the benefit
of the holders of Registrable Securities), Sections 4.7 and 4.8 (which are for
the benefit of the Indemnified Persons) and Section 4.12 and Section 5.3
(which are for the benefit of the Debt Financing Parties), none of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be for the benefit of, or enforceable by,
any third-party beneficiary.

5.14 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Company Investors Agreement and the
Holdings Investment Agreement (including any schedules thereof) constitute the
entire contractual understanding between the parties and supersedes all
proposals, commitments, writings, negotiations, and understandings, or and
written, and all other communications between the parties relating to the
subject matter hereof. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and
the Holdings Investment Agreement, or the Company Investors Agreement, this
Agreement shall control.

5.15 Headings. The headings of the Sections herein are inserted for
convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a part of or to
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

5.16 No Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against the named
parties hereto. All claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise
out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement may be made only against the entities that are
expressly identified hereto, and no past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, shareholder, affiliate,
agent, attorney or representative of any party hereto (including any person
negotiating or executing this Agreement on behalf of a party hereto) shall
have any liability or obligation with respect to this Agreement or with
respect to any claim or cause of action, whether in tort, contract or
otherwise, that may arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

5.17 Specific Performance. The parties agree that if any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed by the parties hereto in accordance with
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and that each party hereto will be entitled to specific performance
to prevent such breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, including the obligation of the
other parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which such party may be entitled
at law or in equity. Furthermore, JCF III Europe S.a r.l. shall be entitled to
the rights and remedies under the Company Investors Agreement. The parties
hereto further agrees not to assert that a remedy of specific performance is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to applicable law or regulation or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives any
defenses in any action for specific performance, including the defense that a
remedy at law would be adequate and

* * *



any requirement for the other party to post any bond or other security as a
condition to institute any proceeding for specific performance, an injunction
or other equitable relief hereunder.

5.18 Termination Procedure. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that
this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Initial Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Purchaser and Seller;

(b) by either Purchaser or Sellers if the Initial Closing has not occurred on
or before August 10, 2018 (the "End Date"); provided, however that neither
Purchaser nor Sellers shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 5.18(b) if such party's breach of this Agreement (for the
avoidance of doubt, including the failure of a party to consummate the Closing
when required pursuant to Section 1.4) has prevented the consummation of the
Initial Closing by such date; provided, that if the conditions set forth in
Section 2.1(d) and Section 2.2(d) have not been satisfied or waived on or
prior to such date, but all other conditions set forth in Section 2 have been
satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing), then the End Date may be extended by either
Purchaser or Seller by delivery of written notice to the other to a date not
beyond September 9, 2018;

(c) by Purchaser with written notice to Sellers, if the representations and
warranties of any Seller shall not be true and correct or there has been a
material violation or breach by any Seller of any covenant, representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement, in each case, which has prevented the
satisfaction of any condition precedent in Section 2.2 at the applicable
Closing and such failure, violation or breach has not been waived by Purchaser
or cured by Seller within 15 days after written notice thereof from Purchaser;
provided, however that Purchaser is not in material breach of its obligations
under this Agreement;

(d) by either Purchaser or Sellers if there shall be any law that makes
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or if the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby would violate any final
non-appealable order of any governmental entity having competent jurisdiction;

(e) by Sellers with written notice to Purchaser, if the representations and
warranties of Purchaser shall not be true and correct or there has been a
material violation or breach by Purchaser of any covenant, representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement, in each case, which has prevented the
satisfaction of any condition precedent in Section 2.1 at the applicable
Closing and such failure, violation or breach has not been waived by Seller or
cured by Purchaser within 15 days after written notice thereof from Seller;
provided, however that no Seller is in material breach of its obligations
under this Agreement; and

(f) by Sellers with written notice to Purchaser, if all of the conditions in
Section 2.2 have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) and Parent and Purchaser have
failed to consummate the Closing on or before the second business day after
the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 1.4.

5.19 Effect of Termination.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated as described in Section 5.18, this
Agreement shall become void and of no further force or effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of the parties hereto (or any affiliate
thereof), except that the provisions of Section 5 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement; provided however, that nothing in this Section
5.19 shall be deemed to release any party from any liability or damages
resulting from or arising out of any breach of such party of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt it is understood that
a party's failure to consummate the Closing at the time the Closing is
required to occur pursuant to Section 1.4 shall be considered a breach
hereunder.

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated without the Closing having
occurred pursuant to Section 5.18, then the parties agree that Seller shall be
entitled to such rights as set forth in the Company Investors Agreement.

5.20 Survival of Representations and Warranties; Limitation of Liability. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of
18 months following the Closing. Those covenants and agreements contained
herein and therein which by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole
or in part after the date of this Agreement shall survive the Closing until
performed in accordance with their terms. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or provided for under any applicable law, the
aggregate liability of Parent and Purchaser for Losses arising out of or
resulting from claims under Section 3.2 shall in no event exceed $20,000,000.
