          (d)  Other.  Agree in writing or otherwise to take any of the actions

date hereof through the Closing Date, Global Crossing NA will make on behalf of
the Company, or will cause the Company to make, all capital expenditures
required by the Company to continue Company operations as presently conducted on
the date hereof and as planned to be conducted through the Closing Date,
including without limitation those capital expenditures set forth in the Capital
Plan. Any material deviations from the Capital Plan or any material changes in

preceding sentence, must be approved by Exodus. Prior to the Closing Date,
Global Crossing NA shall (i) fund, or cause to be funded, to the extent not

subsidiaries (including capital expenditures pursuant to the Capital Plan) from
the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date in the Ordinary Course and (ii)
cause the Company to, and the Company shall, pay its payables, collect its
receivables, and otherwise manage its working capital accounts, in the Ordinary
Course and consistent with past practice. In the event that non-cash working
capital of the Company is negative immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Global Crossing NA shall contribute to Company sufficient cash to eliminate such
negative working capital account balance as of the Closing. After Closing the
parties will determine the amount of any positive working capital balance of the

                                   ------------------
anniversary of the Closing, Exodus shall pay to Global Crossing NA any Positive
WC Amount. In addition, if at Closing the Company has not spent the full amount
of its Capital Plan during the period covered thereby, Global Crossing NA shall
also pay Exodus at Closing the difference between the amount of capital
expenditures during such period and the Capital Plan amount for the indicated
period. Conversely, if at Closing the Company has spent more than the full
amount of its Capital Plan during the period covered thereby, Exodus shall pay
to Global Crossing NA at Closing the excess of such capital expenditures for the
indicated period over the Capital Plan amount. If during any calendar month
prior to Closing the Company fails to spend the full amount specified in its
Capital Plan for such month, then Global Crossing NA or the Company shall notify
Exodus in writing of such shortfall, the amount thereof, and the reasons
therefore. In the event that the Closing does not occur by December 31, 2000,
the Company shall deliver to Exodus by that date the Company's capital
expenditure plan for the three month period ended March 31, 2001, and references
above to the "Capital Plan" shall apply to this additional capital plan as well.

     4.5  Leases.
          ------

     The Company shall confer with Exodus before the Company or any of its
subsidiaries enters into any lease in which the landlord does not provide
representations and warranties

<PAGE>

relating to environmental matters or in which the landlord does not indemnify
the Company and its subsidiaries against environmental liabilities.

     4.6  Disclosures.
          -----------

     Prior to Closing, the Company will provide Exodus with (i) a list of any
material agreements with respect to software, hardware, network and technology
infrastructure, bandwidth and connectivity used in the Company or its
subsidiaries' business as currently conducted which, if terminated, could have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company and (ii) a list of any royalties, fees or
other payments payable by the Company or its subsidiaries to any Person by
reason of the ownership, use, sale or disposition of any Company Intellectual
Property.

     4.7  Extinguishments of Debt; No Cash.
          --------------------------------

     Global Crossing NA shall cause all intercompany and third party
indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries for borrowed money (excluding
trade payables, lease obligations and similar obligations) or guarantees by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries of any third party indebtedness to be settled
or otherwise terminated on or prior to the Closing Date and shall cause the
assets of the Company and its subsidiaries to be released from any such
indebtedness. The Company shall not be required to have any cash at Closing
except as provided in Section 4.4.

     4.8  Assumption of Lease Guarantees.
          ------------------------------

Crossing NA or one of its affiliates of the Company's and its subsidiaries'
performance relating to leases to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries
are a party.

purchasing a substantial portion of the assets or stock of, or by any other
means, any business or any corporation, limited liability company, partnership,
association or other business organization or division thereof (excluding only

$750 million in value), or agree to any such transaction (each, an "Exodus
                                                                    ------

the transactions contemplated by the Agreement within ten (10) days after the
date of this Agreement, then the HSR Exclusivity Period will be extended on a
day for day basis for each day after such first ten days until the day Exodus
files such notification request form (provided, that the HSR Exclusivity Period
will not be so extended to the extent that the failure to file on any day is due
to Global Crossing Ltd. not being prepared to file), (b) to the extent the
approval of an Exodus Acquisition requires the approval of Exodus' stockholders,
the stockholder vote for such transaction is not held any earlier than (but it
may be held on the same day and at the same stockholder meeting as) the

                                      33

stockholder meeting to approve the Merger; and (c) such Exodus Acquisition is
not conditioned on (nor does it require) (x) the cancellation, termination,
abandonment or modification of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements or the Commercial Agreements (as
defined in Section 6.1(d)), (y) the Exodus Board recommending against the
approval of issuance of shares in the Merger, or (z) the Exodus stockholders
voting against approval of the Merger. Notwithstanding the first sentence
hereof, if requested by Exodus, the Company will in good faith discuss
permitting Exodus to make an HSR filing in respect of any other business
combination prior to the date Exodus would otherwise be permitted to make such
filing pursuant to this Section 4.9.

     5.1  Proxy Statement.
          ---------------

     As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Exodus
shall prepare, with the cooperation of the Company, the Exodus Proxy Statement.
Exodus shall use its best efforts to file the Exodus Proxy Statement with the
SEC as soon as practicable after the date on which the Company provides audited
financial statements of the Company for inclusion in the Exodus Proxy Statement
and shall use its best efforts to clear all SEC comments and mail the Exodus
Proxy Statement to all stockholders of Exodus entitled to receive such notice
under Delaware Law as promptly as possible thereafter. Whenever any event occurs
with respect to the Company or Exodus that is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Exodus Proxy Statement, the applicable party
shall promptly inform the other party of such occurrence and cooperate in
mailing to stockholders of Exodus such amendment or supplement. The Exodus Proxy
Statement shall include the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Exodus
that the Exodus stockholders vote in favor of the issuance of shares of Exodus
Common Stock in the Merger and the conclusion of the Board of Directors that the
terms and conditions of the Merger are fair to the stockholders of Exodus (the
"Recommendation"), along with a copy of the written opinion referred to in
 --------------
Section 3.13; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall prevent
              --------  -------
the Board of Directors of Exodus from withholding, withdrawing, amending or
modifying the Recommendation if (i) Exodus receives an unsolicited, bona fide
Third Party Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 5.7(b)) that is
conditioned on (or requires) the cancellation, termination, abandonment or
modification of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the
Ancillary Agreements or the Commercial Agreements (an "Exodus Acquisition
                                                       ------------------
Offer") and such Exodus Acquisition Offer is not withdrawn, (ii) Exodus shall
-----
have provided written notice to the Company advising the Company that Exodus has
received an Exodus Acquisition Offer, specifying all of the material terms and
conditions of such an Exodus Acquisition Offer and identifying the person or
entity making such Exodus Acquisition Offer, (iii) the Board of Directors of
Exodus concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of national standing, that, in light of such
Exodus Acquisition Offer, the withholding, withdrawal, amendment or modification
of the Recommendation is required in order for the Board of Directors of Exodus
to comply with its fiduciary obligations to Exodus' stockholders under
applicable law. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence the
Board of Directors of Exodus will not withhold, withdraw, amend or modify the
Recommendation (a "Withdrawal of Recommendation"). Anything to the
                   ----------------------------

                                      34
<PAGE>

contrary contained herein notwithstanding, Exodus shall not include in the
Exodus Proxy Statement any information with respect to the Company or its
affiliates or associates, the form and content of which information shall not
have been approved by the Company prior to such inclusion (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

     5.2  Meeting of Stockholders.
          -----------------------

     Exodus shall promptly after the date hereof take all action necessary in
accordance with Delaware Law, Nasdaq rules and its Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws to convene a meeting of the stockholders of Exodus for the purpose of
approving the issuance of shares of Exodus Common Stock in the Merger (referred
to as the "Exodus Stockholders Meeting") as soon as practicable after the date
           ---------------------------
that the Exodus Proxy Statement shall be cleared by the SEC for mailing to the
stockholders of Exodus. Exodus shall consult with the Company regarding the date
of or any postponements or adjournments of the Exodus Stockholders Meeting and,
except as provided in the next sentence, shall not postpone or adjourn Exodus
Stockholders Meeting without the consent of the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing two sentences, Exodus may adjourn or postpone the Exodus Stockholders
Meeting (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any amendment or supplement
to the Exodus Proxy Statement required under the Securities Act due to
developments following the initial mailing thereof is provided to Exodus
stockholders in advance of a vote on the Merger (in which case the Exodus
Stockholders Meeting shall be held on the next legally permissible business day,
but in no event more than ten (10) business days after the originally scheduled
date) or (ii) if, as of the originally scheduled date and time for the Exodus
Stockholders Meeting (as set forth in the Exodus Proxy Statement), there are
insufficient shares of Exodus Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute the quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Exodus
Stockholders Meeting (in which case the Exodus Stockholders Meeting shall be
adjourned until such quorum is available, but in no event more than ten (10)
business days after the originally scheduled date). Exodus's obligation to call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Exodus Stockholders Meeting in accordance
with this Section 5.2 shall not be limited to or otherwise affected by the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to Exodus of any Third
Party Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 5.7(b)), or by any withdrawal,
amendment or modification of the recommendation of the Board of Directors of
Exodus with respect to the Merger. Exodus shall use its best efforts to solicit
from stockholders of Exodus proxies in favor of the issuance of share of Exodus
Common Stock in the Merger and shall, subject to the Exodus board's fiduciary
duty, take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent
of stockholders required to effect the Merger.

     5.3  Access to Information.

and its accountants, counsel and other representatives copies of material
internal financial statements promptly upon request.

          (c)  No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation
pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the obligations
of the parties to consummate the Merger.

     5.4  Confidentiality.
          ---------------

     The parties acknowledge that Exodus and the Company have previously
executed reciprocal non-disclosure agreements dated June 30, 2000 (the
"Confidentiality Agreements"), which Confidentiality Agreements shall continue
 --------------------------
in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms, except that
the terms of the "standstill" agreements contained in each such Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate at Closing.

     5.5  Public Disclosure.
          -----------------

     The Company Parties, on the one hand, and Exodus Parties, on the other
hand, will consult with each other before holding any press conferences or
analyst calls and before issuing any press releases or making any public
statements relating to this Agreement or the Merger or any other transaction in
which the other party is engaged. The parties will provide each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon any proposed press release or public
statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or public
statements prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable
law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange or automated quotation system. The parties agree
that the initial press release or releases to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be mutually agreed upon prior
to the issuance thereof.

     5.6  Consents; Cooperation.
          ---------------------

          (a)  Each of Exodus and the Company shall as soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement, apply for or otherwise seek, and use its best
efforts, subject to Section 5.6(b), to obtain, all consents and approvals
required to be obtained by it as a condition to the Closing of the Merger under
HSR and other Antitrust Laws (as defined below). The Company, in conjunction
with and as reasonably requested by Exodus, shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and approvals under any of its
material contracts set forth on Item 2.3 to the Company Disclosure Letter in
                                --------
connection with the Merger for the assignment thereof or otherwise. The parties
hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith
the views of one another, in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or

                                      36
<PAGE>

submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings
under or relating to HSR or any other Antitrust Laws.

          (b)  Each of Exodus and the Company shall use best efforts to resolve
such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR, the
Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, the competition laws of the European Union, and any
other Federal, state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders or decrees
that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose
or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively, "Antitrust
                                                                  ---------
Laws"). In connection therewith, if any administrative or judicial action or
----
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law,
each of Exodus and the Company shall cooperate and use best efforts vigorously
to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed, or overturned any Order that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents, or restricts consummation of the Merger or any such other
transactions, unless by mutual agreement Exodus and the Company decide that
litigation is not in their respective best interests. Each of Exodus and the
Company shall use best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause
the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR or other Antitrust Laws with
respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this
Agreement.

          (c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.6(a) or
(b), (i) Exodus shall not be required to (A) take any other action or agree to
any limitation that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Exodus or the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time or to (B)
divest any of its or its subsidiaries' businesses, product lines or assets, and
(ii) the Company may not agree to divest any of its businesses, product lines or
assets, or to take or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation
without the consent of Exodus.

     5.7. No Solicitation.
          ---------------

          (a)  Without the prior written consent of the Company, prior to the
Exodus Stockholders Meeting (as defined), neither Exodus nor any of its
affiliates shall, nor shall Exodus or any of its affiliates authorize or permit
any of its or their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives
or agents to, directly or indirectly, knowingly solicit or knowingly initiate
discussions or negotiations with or provide any non-public information to any
person or group concerning any Third Party Acquisition Proposal; provided,
however, that Exodus may, in response to a Third Party Acquisition Proposal that
was not solicited or initiated by Exodus, (i) furnish information to any such
person only pursuant to a confidentiality agreement substantially in the same
form as was executed by GlobalCenter prior to the execution of this Agreement,
and/or (ii) participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such proposal
or offer; provided, further, that nothing herein shall prevent the Board of
Directors of Exodus from taking and disclosing to Exodus stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with
regard to any tender or exchange offer. Exodus shall promptly (i) notify the
Company in the event Exodus or any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates or
any of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents receives any
Third Party Acquisition Proposal and (ii) from time to time, provide the Company
such information and

                                      37
<PAGE>

documents with respect to such Third Party Acquisition Proposal as shall be
necessary to enable the Company to fully understand the potential impact of such
Third Party Acquisition Proposal on the timing and certainty of the Closing (if
any such impact would be reasonably likely if Exodus were to agree to or
consummate such Third Party Acquisition Proposal), provided that the Company
agrees to keep such information confidential in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreements. Exodus will request that the party making the Third
Party Acquisition Proposal publicly support the Merger and not require the
cancellation, termination, abandonment or modification of the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements or the
Commercial Agreements, but neither Exodus nor such third party shall have any
liability if the third party refuses to abide by such request or acts contrary
to it.

          (b) For the purposes of this Agreement, "Third Party Acquisition
                                                   -----------------------
Proposal" means any proposal or offer with respect to: (i) a merger,
--------
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization or similar transaction involving Exodus and any person (which
includes a "person" as such term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange
            ------
Act) (a "Third Party"), except if the shares of Exodus Common Stock outstanding
         -----------
immediately prior to such transaction (and any related transactions) will
represent a majority of the voting power of the outstanding securities of the
resulting or surviving corporation or the parent thereof (in which event such
transaction will be deemed to be an Exodus Acquisition and be subject to Section
4.9, except as otherwise therein provided); (ii) the acquisition by a Third
Party of any material portion (which shall include thirty percent (30%) or more)
of the assets of Exodus and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; (iii) the
acquisition by a Third Party of securities of Exodus that would result in any
person (or the stockholders of such person) beneficially owning securities
representing thirty percent (30%) of the voting power of Exodus (or the parent
entity in such transaction) other than in connection with a transaction
described in clause (i) above without reference to the exception therefrom; (iv)
the adoption by Exodus of a plan of liquidation or the declaration or payment of
an extraordinary dividend; or (v) the repurchase by Exodus or any of its
subsidiaries of more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding shares of
Exodus Common Stock. As used herein, the term "Third Party Acquisition" means
                                               -----------------------
any event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition of "Third

          ------------

     Exodus shall take all actions, as required by the Stockholder Agreement, to
appoint at Closing one (1) member to its Board of Directors designated by Global
Crossing NA. The person designated by Global Crossing NA will be subject to the
approval of the Board of Directors of Exodus and of the governance or other
nominating committee thereof, which approval will not be withheld unless, based
on advice of counsel, such approval would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the members of the Board.

Surviving Corporation, or obtain the necessary rights for the Surviving
Corporation with respect to, any real property used by the Company and its
subsidiaries as a data center as of the Closing Date. Each sublease or license
shall be in form and substance customary for the location. The term of such
sublease or license shall be concurrent with the term of the underlying lease or
property right. At least until December 31, 2001, the rental or license fee to
be paid by the Surviving Corporation with respect to such sublease or license
shall be equal to the rental or license fee paid by the Company or the
applicable Company subsidiary would have paid with respect to such real property
if there had not been any change of control of the Company; provided, however,
                                                            --------  -------
that if a fair market rental or license payment is required with respect to such
sublease or license by (i) applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the
property is located or (ii) the provisions of the lease or other agreement
currently in effect with respect to such property, then the rental or license
payment to be paid by the Surviving Corporation after the Closing shall be equal
to a fair market rental or license payment; and provided, further, that Exodus
                                                --------  -------
and Global Crossing NA shall use their best efforts to avoid such adjustment in
the rental or license fee. If such adjustment is not avoidable and the rental or
license fee, as so adjusted, represents a material change from the Company's
financial assumptions, then Exodus and Global Crossing NA shall use their best
efforts to agree on appropriate equitable financial adjustments. If the parties
are unable to agree on fair market rental or license amounts, they shall
together choose an independent appraiser, whose decision shall be binding. After
December 31, 2001, any rental or license fee with respect to any sublease or
license contemplated by this Section 6.3(f) may be raised to fair market value.

              ----------
any Action before any agency, court or tribunal, foreign or domestic, against

any of their officers or directors (in their capacities as such) that would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Global Crossing NA affirmatively agrees to
indemnify Exodus against claims relating to such Action pursuant to Article X
without reference to the Threshold limitation therein, this clause (g) shall not
be a condition to the obligations of the Exodus Parties to consummate and effect
this Agreement.

the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be
available to any party whose action or failure to act has been the cause or

further, that the Final Closing Date shall be extended for so long as the
parties are in good faith actively pursuing any required approval or waiver of
any Governmental Entity under the Antitrust Laws, and for ten (10) days after

breach shall not have been cured within ten (10) business days of receipt by the
Company of written notice of such breach (or within thirty (30) days of such
receipt of written notice if the breach is curable but cannot reasonably be
cured within ten business days), provided that the right to terminate this
Agreement by Exodus under this Section 7.1(c)(i) shall not be available to

not have been cured within ten (10) business days following receipt by Exodus of
written notice of such breach (or within thirty (30) days of such receipt of
written notice if the breach is curable but cannot reasonably be cured within
ten business days), provided that the right to terminate this Agreement by the
Company under this Section 7.1(d) shall not be available to the Company in the

employees or agents shall have knowingly breached Section 5.7 or Section 4.9
hereof; or

                                      46
<PAGE>

          (e) by either the Company or Exodus, if a Governmental Entity shall
have issued an order, decree or ruling, or taken any other action, in any case
having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the Merger or the transactions contemplated by the Commercial Agreements, which
order, decree, ruling or other action is final and non appealable.

     7.2  Effect of Termination.
          ---------------------

     In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or
obligation on the part of Exodus or the Company Parties or their respective
officers, directors, stockholders or affiliates in respect of any provision of
this Agreement that does not survive such termination, except (subject to
Section 7.3(b)) to the extent that such termination results from the willful
breach by a party hereto of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
set forth in this Agreement; provided, however, that the provisions of Section
5.4 (Confidentiality), Section 7.3 (Expenses and Termination Fees) and this
Section 7.2 and of Article IX shall remain in full force and effect and survive
any termination of this Agreement.

     7.3  Expenses and Termination Fees.
          -----------------------------

          (a) Subject to Section 7.3(b), whether or not the Merger is
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including, without limitation, the
fees and expenses of its advisers, accountants and legal counsel) shall be paid
by the party incurring such expense.

          (b) In the event that the Company shall, at a time when there is no
breach of this Agreement such as would cause the condition set forth in Section
6.3(a) hereof to not be satisfied, and prior to approval of the Merger by Exodus
stockholders, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) following
the making of an Exodus Acquisition Offer then Exodus shall promptly (but in no
event later then five (5) business days after such termination) pay to the
Company Sixty Five Million Dollars ($65,000,000), and if within one year after
such termination a Third Party Acquisition shall have occurred or Exodus or any
of its subsidiaries shall have entered into an agreement providing for a Third

such Third Party Acquisition) pay to Company the additional amount of Two
Hundred Thirty-Five Million Dollars ($235,000,000). In the event that Company

Exodus Acquisition Offer (which term for purposes of this Section 7.3(b) also
includes any Third Party Acquisition Proposal that has been publicly disclosed
prior to the Exodus Stockholders Meeting and with respect to which neither the
party making that Third Party Acquisition Proposal nor Exodus has publicly
disclosed prior to the Exodus Stockholders Meeting that the party making that
Third Party Acquisition Proposal has made an unconditional commitment to support
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements and the
Commercial Agreements) and, either (A) no later than one year after such
termination the Third Party Acquisition contemplated by such pending Exodus
Acquisition Offer ("Pending Transaction") shall have occurred or Exodus or any
                    -------------------

no event later than five (5) business days after the earlier of the consummation
of the Pending Transaction under clause (A) or the consummation of the Third
Party Acquisition under clause (B)) pay to Company the amount of Three Hundred
Million Dollars ($300,000,000). Any payment pursuant to this Section 7.3(b)
shall be made in immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
specified by the Company. Such payment will relieve Exodus from any liability it
might otherwise have in accordance with Section 7.2 with respect to any breach
of this Agreement.

                                 ARTICLE VIII

                                  TAX MATTERS

     8.1  Liability for Taxes.
          -------------------

          (a) Global Crossing NA shall be liable for and indemnify Exodus or the
Company as the case may be, for all Taxes imposed on the Company or its
subsidiaries, or for which the Company or its subsidiaries may otherwise be
liable (including liabilities pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-
6(a) or any similar provision of any state, local or foreign law), for any
taxable year or period that ends on or before the Closing Date (such periods
referred to as "Pre-Closing Tax Periods" and Taxes for such periods referred to
                -----------------------
as "Pre-Closing Taxes") and, with respect to any portion of a taxable year or
    -----------------
period beginning before and ending after the Closing Date (such periods referred
to as "Straddle Periods" and Taxes for such periods referred to as "Straddle
       ----------------                                             --------
Taxes"), the portion of such Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing
-----
Date; provided, however, that Global Crossing NA shall have no obligation to
make any payment pursuant to this Section 8.1, until the amounts that would
otherwise be payable pursuant to this Section 8.1 (apart from this proviso)
exceed the reserve for Taxes on the Financial Statements.

                                      48
<PAGE>

          (b) The Company shall be liable for, and Exodus shall indemnify Global
Crossing NA and its affiliates for, all Taxes imposed on Global Crossing NA or
any of its affiliates with respect to the Company or its subsidiaries for any
taxable year or period that begins after the Closing Date (such periods referred
to as "Post-Closing Tax Periods" and such Taxes referred to as "Post-Closing
       ------------------------                                 ------------
Taxes") and, with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of such Straddle
-----
Period beginning after the Closing Date.

          (c) For purposes of this Section 8.1, whenever it is necessary to
determine the liability for Income Taxes of the Company or its subsidiaries for
a portion of a Straddle Period, the determination of the Income Taxes for the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on, and the portion of the Straddle Period
beginning after, the Closing Date, shall be determined by assuming that the
Company and its subsidiaries had a taxable year or period that ended at the
close of the Closing Date. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the
parties agree to elect to treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable
year. In the case of a Tax that is not based on net income, the Tax for the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be the Tax for
the Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the period on or before the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the total number of days in the Straddle Period.

          (d) Exodus covenants that it will not cause or permit the Company, its
subsidiaries or any affiliate of Exodus (i) to take any action on the Closing
Date other than in the Ordinary Course, including but not limited to the
distribution of any dividend or the effectuation of any redemption, that could
give rise to any Tax liability or reduce any Tax attribute of the Global
Crossing NA Group or (ii) take any Tax position on any Tax Return, take any
action, omit to take any action or enter into any transaction that results in
any increased Tax liability or reduction of any Tax attribute of the Global
Crossing NA Group in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any pre-closing
portion of a Straddle Period without the prior written consent of Global
Crossing NA, unless it is required to do so by law. Exodus agrees that the
Global Crossing NA Group shall have no Tax liability or reduction of any Tax
attribute resulting from any prohibited action described in the preceding
sentence and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Global Crossing NA Group
against any such Tax and any loss, liability, claim, damage, expense or Tax for
which indemnification is provided under this Article VIII (as defined below) in
connection therewith.

     8.2  Tax Refunds.
          -----------

          (a) Global Crossing NA shall be entitled to any refund of any Pre-
Closing Taxes of the Company and its subsidiaries and any Taxes of the Company
and its subsidiaries for the pre-Closing portion of a Straddle Period,
including, in each case, interest paid thereon. Global Crossing NA shall have
the right to determine whether any claim for refund for such Taxes shall be made
on behalf of Global Crossing NA by the Company and its subsidiaries. If Global
Crossing NA elects to make a claim for refund, Exodus, the Company and its
subsidiaries shall cooperate fully in connection therewith. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Global Crossing NA shall not be entitled to make any claim for refund
of Taxes which would materially adversely affect the liability for Taxes of
Exodus, the Company or its subsidiaries for any Post-Closing Tax Period or the
portion of a Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date without the prior
written consent of Exodus; provided, however, that such consent shall not be
unreasonably

                                      49
<PAGE>

withheld and such consent shall not be necessary to the extent that Global
Crossing NA has indemnified Exodus against the effects of any such claim for
refund. Global Crossing NA shall reimburse Exodus and the Company and its
subsidiaries for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such
cooperation.

          (b) If an indemnified party receives a refund or credit of Taxes for
which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Agreement, such indemnified party
agrees to pay to the indemnifying party the amount of such refund or credit
(including any interest received thereon).

          (c) Subject to the following sentence and to the extent permitted by
law, Exodus will elect to forego any carrybacks for the Company and its
subsidiaries incurred in any Post-Closing Tax Period. Except as provided in the
following sentence, neither Global Crossing NA nor any of its affiliates shall
be required to pay to Exodus, the Company or its subsidiaries any refund or
credit of Taxes that results from the carryback to any Pre-Closing Tax Period of
any net operating loss, capital loss or tax credit attributable to the Company
or its subsidiaries in any Post-Closing Tax Period, except that the Company and
its subsidiaries that have not filed consolidated, combined, unitary or similar
returns with Global Crossing NA or any of its affiliates (other than the Company
or any of its subsidiaries) shall be entitled to carry back losses or tax
credits from any such Post-Closing Tax Period to any Pre-Closing Tax Period and
to receive any resulting refund of Taxes including any interest received
thereon, but only if such carryback would not impose a material Tax cost or
otherwise materially adversely affect Global Crossing NA or any of its
affiliates, unless Exodus has indemnified Global Crossing NA for such material
Tax costs or material adverse affect on an after-tax basis. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, if and to the extent that Exodus is not permitted by
applicable law to forego a carryback, then solely with respect to such carryback
to the extent that Global Crossing NA receives a refund of Taxes attributable to
such carryback from a Post-Closing Tax Period of the Company and its
subsidiaries or for the portion of a Straddle Period after the Closing Date,
Global Crossing NA shall pay to Exodus, net of any additional costs (other than
costs that are indemnified pursuant to Section 8.2(d) hereof), incurred by or
Taxes payable by Global Crossing NA or any of its affiliates by reason of such
carryback, such refund including any interest received thereon.

          (d) If and to the extent that Exodus (i) is not permitted by
applicable law to forego a carryback of any net operating loss, capital loss or
tax credit attributable to the Company or its subsidiaries, (ii) timely requests
in writing that Global Crossing NA obtain a refund with respect to such
carryback, and (iii) indemnifies and holds harmless Global Crossing NA on an
after-tax basis for all costs and expenses incurred in respect of obtaining such
refund, then Global Crossing NA shall take all reasonable measures to obtain a
refund with respect to such carryback; provided, however, that Global Crossing
NA shall have sole discretion with respect to the manner in which any amended
Tax Return shall be prepared and filed.

     8.3  Amended Returns.
          ---------------

     Without the prior written consent of Global Crossing NA, neither Exodus,
the Company or its subsidiaries, nor any affiliate of Exodus shall (i) make any
election relating to Taxes or (ii) file any amended Tax Returns or propose or
agree to any adjustment of any item with the Internal Revenue Service or any
other Taxing Authority that would have the effect of increasing

                                      50
<PAGE>

the liability for any Taxes or reducing any Tax benefit of Global Crossing NA,
the Company or its subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing
portion of a Straddle Period. Without the prior written consent of Exodus,
Global Crossing NA shall not file any amended Tax Returns for any Pre-Closing
Period that could have a material adverse affect on the liability of the Company
or its subsidiaries for any Taxes for a Post-Closing Period. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein (except as provided in Section 8.2(d)), in no
event shall Exodus, the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any affiliate of
Exodus have any rights to make any election or file any amended Tax Return, or
take any other action with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary Tax
Returns of any of the Global Crossing NA Group.

     8.4  Tax Returns.
          -----------

     Global Crossing NA shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and timely file
or cause to be filed when due, including extensions thereof, all Tax Returns
that are required to be filed with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries
for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and shall pay any Taxes due in respect of such Tax
Returns, and, except as specified in the following two sentences, Exodus shall
timely file or cause to be filed when due, including extensions thereof, all
other Tax Returns with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries and shall
timely pay any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Global Crossing NA in
its sole discretion shall have the right to prepare or cause to be prepared all
consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns of any of the Global Crossing NA
Group members for all Tax periods. Global Crossing NA in its sole discretion
shall have the right to prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all
Tax Returns that are required to be filed with respect to the Company and its
subsidiaries for any Straddle Period. If Global Crossing NA does not exercise
its rights in the preceding sentence, Exodus shall prepare or cause to be
prepared any Straddle Period Tax Returns that Global Crossing NA does not
prepare. Any such Straddle Period Tax Return (regardless of which party prepares
it) shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices and without a
change of any election or accounting method and shall be submitted by the
preparing party to the other party (together with schedules, statements and
supporting documentation) at least twenty (20) days prior to the due date
(including extensions of such Tax Returns). Such other party shall have the
right to review all work papers and procedures used to prepare any such Tax
Return. If such other party, within ten (10) business days after delivery of any
such Tax Return, notifies the preparing party in writing that it objects to any
of the items in such Tax Return, the preparing party shall attempt in good faith
to resolve the dispute and, if they are unable to do so, the disputed items
shall be resolved (within a reasonable time, taking into account the deadline
for filing such Tax Return) by an internationally recognized independent
accounting firm chosen by and mutually acceptable to both Exodus and Global
Crossing NA. Upon resolution of all such items, the relevant Tax Return shall be
adjusted to reflect such resolution and shall be binding upon the parties
without further adjustment. The costs, fees and expenses of such accounting firm
shall be born equally by Exodus and Global Crossing NA. If Exodus fails to agree
to the selection of an accounting firm within seven (7) business days, Global
Crossing NA has the right to adjust the relevant Straddle Period Tax Return in
the manner it deems appropriate and the Tax Return as so adjusted shall be
binding upon the parties without further adjustment.

Crossing NA shall be entitled to determine whether and when to settle any claim,

other party, provided that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

          ----------------------------------------

Company and its subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, and no payments which are
owed by or to the Company or its subsidiaries pursuant thereto shall be made
thereunder.

          --------------------------

assistance as may reasonably be requested by each of them in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any Taxing
Authority, or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liability
for Taxes, and each provide the other with any records or information which may
be relevant to such Tax Return, audit or examination, proceedings or
determination. Such assistance shall include making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder and shall include providing copies of any
relevant Tax Return and supporting work schedules. The party requesting
assistance hereunder shall reimburse the other for reasonable expenses incurred
in providing such assistance. Without limiting in any way the foregoing
provisions of Article VIII, Exodus hereby agrees that it will retain, until the
appropriate statutes of limitation (including any extensions) expire, copies of
all Tax Returns, supporting work schedules and other records or information
which it possesses and which may be relevant to such Tax Returns of the Company
or its subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods or any pre-Closing portion
of a Straddle Period. Further, Exodus will not destroy or otherwise dispose of
such records without first providing Global Crossing NA with a reasonable
opportunity to review and copy such records.

     8.8  Preservation of Reorganization Status.
          -------------------------------------

          --------------

     When a reference is made in this Agreement to Exhibits, such reference
shall be to an Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words
"include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed in each
 -------    --------       ---------
case to be followed by the words "without limitation." The phrases "the date of
                                  ------------------                -----------
this Agreement," "the date hereof," and terms of similar import, unless the
--------------    ---------------
context otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in
the preamble paragraph of this Agreement. References to the "subsidiaries" of a
Person shall be deemed to refer to all of such Person's direct and indirect
subsidiaries. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

     9.4  Counterparts.
          ------------

     This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered
to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the
same counterpart.

     9.5  Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest.
          -------------------------------------------------------

     This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements
specifically referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including the
Exhibits and the Items, including the Company Disclosure Letter and Exodus
Disclosure Letter, (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
continue in full force and effect and except as set forth in Section 9.1, shall
survive any termination of this Agreement or the Closing, in accordance with its
terms (b) are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or
remedies hereunder, except as set forth in Sections 5.14; and (c) shall not be
assigned by operation of law or otherwise by the Company Parties without the
prior written consent of the Exodus Parties or by the Exodus Parties without the
prior written consent of the Company Parties. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, in the event that GCG shall transfer, before Closing, all of the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of GlobalCenter Holding

                                      55
<PAGE>

to an affiliated entity, then GCG may, without further notice to or prior
written consent of any party, assign all of its rights and obligations under
this Agreement to such affiliated entity.

     9.6  Severability.
          ------------

     In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in
full force and effect and the application of such provision to other persons or
circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the
parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable
provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such void or unenforceable provision.

     9.7  Remedies Cumulative.
          -------------------

     Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

     9.8  Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.
          -----------------------------------------

     This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware (without giving effect to choice of law principles
thereof) applicable to contracts made and to be performed in the State of
Delaware. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery or other courts of the State of Delaware
in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the
matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any
manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons, and
waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which it might
otherwise have to such jurisdiction and such process.

          ---------------------

     Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that such party has been
represented by counsel during the negotiation, preparation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waives the application of any law, regulation, holding
or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other
document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

     9.10 Remedies for Breach.
          -------------------

     If any party under this Agreement fails to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by its act or failure to act or do any other act
required of such party under this Agreement, then, if the failure continues for
ten business days after notice to the party in default by the non-defaulting
party, such non-defaulting party may institute and maintain a proceeding to
compel the defaulting party's specific performance of this Agreement. The remedy
of specific

                                      56
<PAGE>

performance shall be in addition to any and all of the remedies at law or in
equity including, but not limited to, injunctive relief and an action for
damages, to which any party may be entitled.

                                   ARTICLE X

                           INDEMNIFICATION; REMEDIES

     10.1 Global Crossing NA's Obligation to Indemnify.
          --------------------------------------------

     From and after the Closing Date, Global Crossing NA hereby agrees to
defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Exodus Parties and their affiliates,
and their respective employees, agents and representatives (collectively,
"Exodus Indemnitees"), from and against any and all actual liabilities,
 ------------------
judgments, damages, claims, demands, costs, expenses (including necessary and
reasonable legal fees and expenses) and losses (each, a "Claim") suffered or
                                                         -----
incurred by reason of (i) any representation or warranty made by any Company
Party in this Agreement (other than representations and warranties contained in
Section 2.11 of this Agreement) having been untrue when made or deemed made or
the breach by any Company Party of any covenant or agreement made by it herein
or (ii) any liabilities arising from or relating to assets of the Company
Parties not used in the business of the Group and not included in the assets of
the Company as of the date hereof; provided, however, that, except as set forth
                                   --------  -------
in Section 5.17 hereto, Global Crossing NA shall have no liability under this
Section 10.1 unless and until the aggregate of all Claims of Exodus Indemnitees
exceeds $33 million (the "Threshold"), whereafter Global Crossing NA shall be
                          ---------
liable for the amount of all Claims of Exodus Indemnitees up to and including
the Threshold and all Claims of Exodus Indemnitees in excess of the Threshold;
and provided further that Global Crossing NA's aggregate liability pursuant to
    -------- -------
this Article X shall not exceed $660 million.

     10.2 Entitlement to Indemnification; Indemnification Amount; Double
          --------------------------------------------------------------
Recovery.
--------

          (a)  The Exodus Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnity under
Section 10.1 for any and all Claims for which written notice specifying the
Claim in reasonable detail is given during the period set forth in Section 10.5.
The termination of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall not affect the rights of any Exodus Indemnitee, to prosecute to
conclusion any Claim resulting from any breach of a representation or warranty
as to which notice is given pursuant to Section 10.4 prior to the termination of
such representation or warranty.

          (b)  The amount of any Claim or Tax (collectively, a "Loss") for which
                                                                ----
indemnification is provided under Article VIII or this Article X shall be net of
any amounts actually recovered by the indemnified party under insurance policies
with respect to such Loss and shall be reduced to take account of any net Tax
benefit by the indemnified party arising from the incurrence or payment of any
such Loss.

          (c)  An Exodus Indemnitee shall not be entitled to a double recovery
of damages under any provision of this Agreement, including the provisions set
forth in Article VIII and this Article X.

                                      57
<PAGE>

     10.3  Sole Remedy.
           -----------

     The indemnification provided in this Article X shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of any Exodus Indemnitee in respect of the matters addressed in
Section 10.1.

     10.4  Claims.
           ------

     Each indemnified party shall, promptly after receipt of notice of a Claim
or action against such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder, notify the applicable indemnifying party in writing of the
Claim or action. If any such Claim or action shall be brought against an
indemnified party, and it shall have notified the indemnifying party thereof,
unless based on the written advice of counsel to such indemnified party a
conflict of interest between such indemnified party and indemnifying parties may
exist in respect of such Claim, then the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate therein, and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other
similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof. After
notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to
assume the defense of such Claim or action in accordance with the preceding
sentence, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party
under this Article X for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by
the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. Any indemnifying
party against whom indemnity may be sought under this Article X shall not be
liable to indemnify an indemnified party if such indemnified party settles such
Claim or action without the consent of the indemnifying party, but such consent
shall not unreasonably be withheld. The indemnifying party may not agree to any
settlement of any such Claim or action, other than solely for monetary damages
for which the indemnifying party shall be responsible hereunder, as a result of
which any remedy or relief shall be applied to or against the indemnified party,
without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall
not unreasonably be withheld. This Section 10.4 shall not apply to claims made
under Article VIII. In any action hereunder as to which the indemnifying party
has assumed the defense thereof, the indemnified party shall continue to be
entitled to participate in the defense thereof, with counsel of its own choice,
but the indemnifying party shall not be obligated hereunder to reimburse the
indemnified party of the costs thereof.

     10.5  Survival.
           --------

     The representations and warranties of the Company Parties contained in
Article II (other than those representations set forth in Section 2.11 hereof)
and the representations and warranties of the Exodus Parties contained in
Article III shall each survive for a period of one (1) year following the
Closing Date, at which time they shall terminate and be of no further force and
effect. Any other representations and warranties (including those
representations set forth in Section 2.11 hereof) of any party which may be
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate on the Closing Date.

     10.6  Satisfaction of Indemnity Obligations.
           -------------------------------------

     Global Crossing NA shall satisfy its indemnification obligations under this
Article X by delivery of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Exodus. Notwithstanding any restriction on the sale of shares of Exodus Common
Stock by Global Crossing NA or any of

                                      58
<PAGE>

its affiliates contained in any agreement between Exodus and Global Crossing NA
or any such affiliates, Global Crossing NA or such affiliates may at any time
sell a number of shares of Exodus Common Stock that will yield proceeds in an
amount equal to Global Crossing NA's indemnification obligations pursuant to
this Article X or Article VIII.

     10.7  Adjustment to Purchase Price.
           ----------------------------

     Exodus and Global Crossing NA agree to report any indemnification payment
made under Article VIII and this Article X and any payment made pursuant to
Section 4.4 as an adjustment to purchase price, contribution to capital made
immediately prior to the Closing Date, or other non-taxable amount to the extent
that there is substantial authority for such reporting position under applicable
law.
