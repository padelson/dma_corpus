as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws affecting
or relating to creditors&rsquo; rights generally and subject to general principles of equity. Other than as expressly set forth
in the Financing Letters or the Fee Letter, there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies (express or implied) related
to the funding of the Financing necessary to pay the Required Amount pursuant to any agreement relating to the Financing to which
any of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is a party. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor
Merger Sub nor, to the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub, the other parties to the Financing Letters or the Fee Letter is in violation
or breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth therein and no event has occurred that, with or without notice or lapse of
time or both, would, or would reasonably be expected to, (A) constitute a default, breach or failure to satisfy a condition precedent
set forth in the Financing Letters, assuming the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties in <U>Article
III</U>, or (B) result in any portion of the Financing necessary to pay the Required Amount being unavailable on the Closing Date,
assuming the conditions to the Financing are satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms thereof. As of the date of this Agreement,
assuming the accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties in <U>Article III</U> and assuming the Company
complies with and performs in all material respects all of its agreements and covenants under this Agreement, Parent has no reason
to believe that (i)&nbsp;it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition to the funding of the Financing necessary
to pay the Required Amount to be satisfied by it contained in the Financing Letters, or (ii) the amount of the Financing necessary
to pay the Required Amount will not be available on the Closing Date in order to fund the Transactions. As of the date hereof,
(i)&nbsp;no party to any Financing Letter or the Fee Letter has notified Parent of its intention to terminate any of the commitments
set forth in the Financing Letters or not to provide the Financing and (ii)&nbsp;no termination of any commitment set forth in
the Financing Letters is contemplated by Parent. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused
to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the
terms of the Financing Letters.</P>

prohibit access to any documents or information to the extent that (a)&nbsp;any applicable Law or Contract requires the Company

such documents or information; (c)&nbsp;access to a Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise
bound as of the date of this Agreement or entered into after the date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business would
violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right terminate or accelerate the rights pursuant to, such

information are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand,

</U>the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its commercially reasonable efforts to develop alternative methods of providing
such information in a manner that would not result in any violation, default, prejudice or loss of privilege. Nothing in this
<U>Section&nbsp;6.9</U> will be construed to require the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives
to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this <U>Section&nbsp;6.9</U> will be conducted in a manner that (i)&nbsp;does not unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the prompt
and timely discharge by officers, employees and other authorized Representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of
their normal duties, or (ii)&nbsp;create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries.
Any access to the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Company&rsquo;s reasonable security measures
and insurance requirements and will not include the right to perform invasive testing. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
