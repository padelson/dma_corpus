WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Purchaser desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

Accordingly, in consideration of the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER

Section 1.1 The Offer.

(a)Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Article
VIII, and subject to the Company having complied with its obligations set
forth in Section 1.2(b), as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
of this Agreement but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days after
the date of this Agreement, Purchaser shall, commence (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")),
the Offer to purchase all of the outstanding Shares at a price per Share equal
to the Offer Price. The date on which Purchaser commences the Offer (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) is referred to as the "Offer
Commencement Date."

(b)The obligations of Purchaser to, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to,
accept for payment, purchase and pay for, any Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted under applicable Law and this Agreement) pursuant to
the terms hereof of the conditions set forth in Annex I (the "Offer
Conditions"), and no other conditions. The Offer shall be made by means of an
offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") that contains the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the Offer Conditions.
Purchaser expressly reserves the right (but shall not be obligated) at any
time and from time to time, in its sole discretion to (i) increase the amount
of cash constituting the Offer Price, (ii) waive (to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws) any Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender Condition)
and (iii) make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, without
the prior written consent of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall not (A)
reduce the number of Shares subject to the Offer, (B) reduce the amount of the
Offer Price, (C) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (D)
impose additional conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions,
or amend or modify any Offer Condition in any manner adverse to the holders of
Shares or that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or
materially impair the ability of Parent or Purchaser to consummate the Offer,
(E) except as otherwise required or expressly permitted by this Section 1.1,
extend or otherwise modify the Expiration Time,

"subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange
Act or (H) otherwise amend or modify any of the other terms of the Offer in a

Paying Agent on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to the Company and
Parent, each in its reasonable discretion (the "Paying Agent Agreement").
Parent shall be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.

the Merger Consideration related to the Merger out of the Payment Fund in
accordance with this Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement. The Payment
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(c)Payment Procedures.

(i)Letter of Transmittal. As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event
within three (3) Business Days, after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares converted into the

or be paid on any amount payable upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.

(iii)Unregistered Transferees. If the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or
Book-Entry Share is registered, then the Merger Consideration may be paid to
such a transferee so long as (A) the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, as applicable, is properly endorsed and presented to the Paying Agent
or is otherwise in proper form for transfer and is accompanied by all
documents reasonably required by Parent to evidence and effect such transfer
and (B) the Person requesting such payment (x) pays any applicable transfer
Taxes or (y) establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent and the
Paying Agent that all such transfer Taxes have already been paid or are not
applicable.



(iv)No Other Rights. Until surrendered in accordance with this Section 3.2(c),
each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed, from and after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
applicable thereto in accordance with this Agreement. Any Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share and, in the case of a Certificate, the Shares
formerly represented by it.

(d)Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate is lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the execution and
delivery by such Person of a customary indemnity agreement to provide
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall make payments of the Merger Consideration
to such Person in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate in
accordance with this Article III.

(e)No Further Transfers. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of the Shares that were outstanding immediately before the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article III.

(f)Required Withholding. Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as they are required to
deduct or withhold therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), or any other applicable Tax Law. To the extent that any
amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid to the Person
in respect of whom such deduction or withholding was made for all purposes
under this Agreement.

(g)No Liability. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for any
amount properly paid to a public official under any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

(h)Investment of Payment Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest the Payment Fund
solely as directed by Parent; provided, that such investment shall be in
obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations of issuers organized under the Law of a state of the United
States of America, rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers' acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $10 billion, or in mutual funds investing solely
in such assets and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity
exceeding three (3) months. Any such investment shall be for the benefit, and
at the risk, of Parent, and any interest or other income resulting from such
investment shall be for the benefit of Parent; provided, that no such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable
hereunder and Parent shall promptly provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to promptly provide, additional funds to the Paying Agent for the
benefit of the holders of Common Stock and Company Equity Awards immediately
prior to the Effective Time such that the Payment Fund has immediate access to
sufficient funds necessary to satisfy the obligations of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation under this Article III.

(i)Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains
unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares one (1) year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent upon
demand. Thereafter, any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who has
not complied with this Article III shall look only to Parent and the Surviving
Corporation, which shall remain responsible for payment of the applicable
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each former share of Common
Stock such stockholder holds pursuant to Section 3.1(c) as determined pursuant
to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.

Section 3.3 Company Equity Awards.

(a)Company Options. As of the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, whether or not then
exercisable or vested, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by
Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the holder of that Company Option, shall be
cancelled and converted into the right (the "Option Payment Right") to receive
from Parent or the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash (the "Option
Payment Amount"), if any, without interest, equal to the product of the Option
Consideration (as defined below) multiplied by the aggregate number of Shares
subject to such Company Option immediately before the Effective Time, which
Option Payment Amount will be paid, as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company Option with a per
share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration
shall be canceled for no consideration. "Option Consideration"



12

US\\\MESSIRY\\\13377947.17

* * *





means the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share
exercise price of the applicable Company Option. The payment of the Option
Payment Amount shall be reduced by any income or employment Tax withholding
required under the Code or any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that any amounts are so withheld and paid to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid
or provided to the holder of that Company Option for all purposes under this
Agreement.

(b)Company RSU Awards. Except as otherwise provided on Section 3.3 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, as of the Effective Time, each Company RSU Award
that is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action by Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the holder
of that Company RSU Award, shall be converted as of the Effective Time into a
restricted stock unit (the "Assumed RSU Award") on the same terms and
conditions (including applicable vesting requirements) under the Company
Equity Plans and award agreements evidencing such Company RSU Awards as
applied to each such Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective

immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Equity Award
Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share).

Company Disclosure Letter, as of the Effective Time, each Company PSU Award
that is outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action by Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the holder
of that Company PSU Award, shall be converted as of the Effective Time into a
restricted stock unit (the "Assumed PSU Award") on the same terms and
conditions (other than any performance conditions, but all time vesting
conditions remain applicable) under the Company Equity Plans and award
agreements evidencing such Company PSU Awards as applied to each such Company
PSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, with respect to the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of
Common Stock subject to the Company PSU Award (assuming for this purpose that
performance in respect of all such outstanding Company PSU Awards was achieved
at a level that resulted in a payout of 100% of the target award) multiplied

Transactions.

Section 5.6 Financing.

(a)Assuming the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions and the condition set
forth in Section 7.1(a), Parent has no reason to believe any term or condition
of the Transaction Financing (as defined below) that is required to be
satisfied by Parent as a condition to such Transaction Financing will not be
satisfied, or that the Transaction Financing will not be available to Parent
on the Closing Date. Assuming the Transaction Financing is funded in
accordance with the Commitment Letter, as of the Closing Date the aggregate

Letter, together with the cash of Parent and its Subsidiaries, will be an
amount sufficient for the satisfaction of Parent's cash payment obligations

amount, the "Required Payment Amount")).

(b)Parent has delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of
executed commitment letters and the executed fee letters related thereto
(collectively, the "Commitment Letter"), and executed Engagement Letters (as
defined below) related thereto (provided, that such fee letters and Engagement

institutions identified therein (together with any other Person (other than
Parent, Purchaser or any of their Affiliates) party to any commitment letters,
engagement letters, joinder agreements, indentures or credit agreements
entered pursuant to in connection with the Transaction Financing or Available
Transaction Financing, together with their respective Affiliates and their
respective officers, employees, directors, equityholders, partners,
controlling parties, advisors, agents and representatives and their successors
and assigns, the "Financing Sources"), pursuant to which, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Financing Sources have
committed to lend the amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Transaction Financing").

(c)Other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter, there are no
other agreements, side letters, arrangements or understandings (except for
customary fee credit letters and customary engagement letters with respect to
debt securities that may form part of the Transaction Financing (the
"Engagement Letters"), in each case associated with the Transaction Financing,
each of which does not (i) impair the enforceability of the Commitment Letter,
(ii) reduce the aggregate amount of the Transaction Financing or (iii) impose
new or additional (or adversely expand, modify or



36

amend any of the existing) conditions precedent to the Transaction Financing)

the Company is in full force and effect and represents the legally valid and
binding obligation of Parent and Purchaser, as applicable, and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. As of the
date hereof, the Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn, rescinded or
terminated or otherwise amended, restated, modified or waived in any respect
and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no such withdrawal, rescission, termination,
amendment, restatement, modification or waiver (other than any amendment,
restatement, modification or waiver that is permitted under Section 6.16(a))
is contemplated. Parent and Purchaser are not in breach of any of the terms or
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter and, as of the date hereof, to
the Knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach,
default or failure to satisfy any condition precedent set forth therein. As of
the date hereof, no Financing Source has notified Parent or Purchaser of its
intention to terminate the Commitment Letter or not to provide the full amount
of the Transaction Financing. All fees or other amounts required to be paid
under the Commitment Letter or otherwise in connection with the Transaction
Financing have been paid in full or, if not yet due, will be duly paid in full
when due.

Section 5.7 Litigation. As of the date hereof, there are no Legal Actions
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of

Representative for the Company in each of the covenants set forth in this
Section 6.4 when determining such violation) shall be deemed a breach of this
Section 6.4 by the Company.

(b)Notwithstanding Section 6.4(a), but without limiting the actions permitted
by Section 6.4(a), prior to the Acceptance Time, following the receipt by the
Company of a bona fide written Takeover Proposal, which did not result from a
breach of Section 6.4, (i) the Company Board shall be permitted to participate
in discussions regarding such Takeover Proposal solely to clarify the terms of
such Takeover Proposal and (ii) if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors, that such
Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal, then the Company may, in response to such Takeover Proposal
following prior written notice to Parent, (x) furnish non-public information
with respect to the Company and any of its Subsidiaries to the Person who has
made such Takeover Proposal pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement between the parties, so long as any non-public information provided
under this clause (x) has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to
Parent prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person,
and (y) participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such Takeover
Proposal. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company Board
shall, after consultation with its outside legal advisers, be entitled to
waive or release any preexisting explicit or implicit standstill provisions or
similar agreements with any Person or group of Persons if the Company Board
determines in good faith that any failure to do so would be reasonably likely
to be a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Except as
permitted by the foregoing sentence, the Company shall seek to enforce any
preexisting explicit or implicit confidentiality or standstill provisions or
similar agreements with any Person or group of Persons.

(c)From and after the date of this Agreement until the Acceptance Time or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, the Company
shall promptly (but in any event within 48 hours) (i) advise Parent orally and
in writing of the receipt of any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or request
that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal specifying
the material

terms and conditions thereof (including a written copy thereof and all
materials related thereto, if any) and the identity of the party making such
Takeover Proposal, (ii) keep Parent reasonably informed of all material
developments affecting the status and terms of any such Takeover Proposal,
inquiry or request and (iii) provide Parent with any written communications or
documentation relating to any such Takeover Proposal inquiry or request,
including any material revisions thereto or to any proposed agreement. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary thereof will enter into any agreement with any
Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company
from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this Section
6.4(c).

(d)Except as set forth in Section 6.4(e) or Section 6.4(f), the Company Board
shall not, directly or indirectly (including not publicly proposing to or
otherwise resolving to do any of the following) (i)(A) withdraw, modify or
amend the Company Board Recommendation in any manner adverse to Parent, or
publicly propose to do any of the foregoing, (B) approve, endorse or recommend
a Takeover Proposal or submit any Takeover Proposal to a vote of the
stockholders of the Company, (C) approve, recommend or allow the Company to
enter into a Contract relating to a Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in compliance with this Section 6.4), (D)
withhold, adversely qualify or modify or fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 when disseminated to the Company's
stockholders or (E) following the commencement of any tender or exchange offer
relating to securities of the Company (other than the Offer) or public
announcement of a Takeover Proposal, fail to issue a press release publicly
announcing within ten (10) Business Days of such commencement or announcement
that the Company recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer or
Takeover Proposal and, at the request of Parent, expressly reaffirming the
Company Board Recommendation (any action described in this clause (i) (even if
permitted by Section 6.4(e) or Section 6.4(f)) being referred to as an
"Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or recommend or enter into,
any Contract, letter of intent, or memorandum of understanding with respect to
any Takeover Proposal, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement in
compliance with this Section 6.4 (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement") or
authorize, resolve or publicly propose to take any such action.

(e)Notwithstanding Section 6.4(d), the Company Board may, at any time prior to
the Acceptance Time and in response to a Superior Proposal received by the
Company Board after the date of this Agreement, make an Adverse Recommendation
Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement, but only if:

(i)the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent at least five (5) Business
Days' prior written notice, which shall state expressly (1) that the Company
Board has determined in good faith after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that it has received a Superior Proposal,
(2) the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal (including the
Person making such proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a copy
of the Alternative Acquisition Agreement and all other material documents
related to the Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or



46

US\\\MESSIRY\\\13377947.17

* * *





any other material term or condition of such Superior Proposal shall require a
new notice and a new three (3) Business Day period) and (3) that, subject to
clause (iii) below, the Company Board has determined to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement in order to enter into
the Alternative Acquisition Agreement, as applicable, (B) prior to making such
an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement, to the extent
requested by Parent in good faith, engaged in good faith negotiations with
Parent during such applicable notice period to amend this Agreement in such a
manner that the Alternative Acquisition Agreement ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal; and

(ii)the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Superior Proposal and taking into account all written or oral information,
opinions or analyses submitted by or on behalf of Parent and any revised terms
proposed by Parent, such proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal.

(f)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 6.4(c), upon
the occurrence of any Intervening Event, the Company Board may, at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, make an Adverse Recommendation Change, only if
all of the following conditions are met:

(i)the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent five (5) Business Days' prior
written notice, which shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail information
describing the Intervening Event and the rationale for the Adverse
Recommendation Change (and shall have contemporaneously provided all material
documents related to the Intervening Event (it being understood and agreed
that change in such Intervening Event shall require a new notice and a new
three (3) Business Day period) and (2) state expressly that, subject to clause
(ii) below, the Company Board has determined in good faith after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, it would be a violation
of the directors' fiduciary duties to fail to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change and (B) prior to making such an Adverse Recommendation Change, to the
extent requested by Parent in good faith, engaged in good faith negotiations
with Parent during such applicable notice period to amend this Agreement in
such a manner that the failure of the Company Board to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to the Intervening Event in accordance with
clause (ii) below would no longer reasonably be expected to be a violation of
the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

(ii)the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that in light of such Intervening Event and
taking into account any revised terms proposed by Parent, the failure to make
an Adverse Recommendation Change would be a violation of the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(g)Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and



47

US\\\MESSIRY\\\13377947.17

* * *





listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any
required disclosure to the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law or such disclosure is otherwise required under applicable
Law. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the issuance of a "stop,
look and listen" statement (or other similar statement pursuant to any
requirement of applicable Law) constitute a change, withdrawal, modification
or amendment of the Company Board Recommendation under this Agreement.

(h)Neither Parent nor Purchaser, nor any of their respective Affiliates or
Representatives shall make, propose or enter into any formal or informal
arrangements or understandings (whether or not binding) with any Person, or
have any discussions or other communications with any other Person (other than
Parent's and Purchaser's respective Affiliates and Representatives), in any
such case with respect to any Takeover Proposal involving the Company.

Section 6.5 Employees; Benefit Plans.

(a)For a period of one year following the Closing Date (or, if earlier, until
the date of termination of the relevant employee) (the "Continuation Period"),
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to, provide to each individual who, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, is an employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
who continues in such capacity immediately following the Effective Time (each,
a "Continuing Employee") (i) base salary or hourly wage rate that is no less
favorable than the base salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable, provided to
the Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) short-
term (annual or more frequent) cash bonus or commission opportunity and other
compensation (including equity and equity-based awards) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided to the Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (iii) benefits that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate to those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, provided that providing for
such Continuing Employee to continue to participate in Company Benefit Plans
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall satisfy this clause
(iii) (it being understood that participation in the Parent benefit plans may
commence at different times with respect to each Parent benefit plan as
determined by Parent in its sole discretion).

(b)Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, honor all Company Benefit Plans
(including all severance, change of control and similar plans and agreements)
to Continuing Employees in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or
termination thereof that may be permitted by such Company Benefit Plans and
except as provided herein. Except as explicitly set forth in this Agreement
(including the other provisions of this Section 6.5), following the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation are not required to maintain any
benefit plan or agreement. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the



48

US\\\MESSIRY\\\13377947.17

* * *





consummation of the Closing shall constitute a change in control of the
Company for purposes of the Company Benefit Plans and any awards thereunder.

(c)2017 Annual Incentive Plan. Notwithstanding any permitted amendment,
termination or discretion applicable to the Company's 2017 Annual Incentive
Plan, Parent agrees to, and agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and each
of their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, to the extent not already
paid prior to Closing, pay bonuses to Continuing Employees under the 2017
Annual Incentive Plan in respect of calendar year 2017 ("2017 Bonuses") in an
amount equal to the target 2017 Bonus applicable to such Continuing Employee.
The 2017 Bonuses shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation at the time or
times that the 2017 Bonuses would normally be paid by the Company, but in no
event later than March 15, 2018, subject to such Continuing Employee's
continued employment through the date that 2017 Bonuses are paid; provided,
however, that any Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated without
"Cause" or who voluntary resigns with "Good Reason" (each, as defined in the
Company's 2013 Stock Incentive Plan) on or following the Closing Date and
prior to the 2017 Bonus payment date (each, a "Qualifying Termination") shall
be entitled to receive his or her 2017 Bonus, payable as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of such Qualifying Termination.

(d)Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor the
Company's retention program providing for retention payments to certain
Continuing Employees set forth on Section 6.5(d) of the Company Disclosure
Letter in connection with the provision of services relating to the
Transactions to such Continuing Employees and on the terms as set forth on
Section 6.5(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Retention Program").
Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and/or Parent shall
pay or cause to be paid such retention payments pursuant to the terms of the
Retention Program.

(e)Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.5 to the contrary, for the later of
the duration of the Continuation Period or the remaining term of any
individual employment, severance or separation agreement that is in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each an "Individual Severance
Agreement"), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Affiliates to, provide each Employee who suffers a termination of
employment under circumstances that would have given the Employee a right to
severance payments and benefits under the Company's or any of the Company's
Subsidiaries' severance policy (each, a "Company Severance Plan") or
Individual Severance Agreement with severance payments and benefits no less
favorable than those that would have been provided to such Continuing Employee
under any Company Severance Plan. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, for no
longer than the Continuation Period, honor the Company's additional severance
program for the Company Employees specified on, and in accordance with the
terms as set forth on, Section 6.5(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(f)For all purposes under all employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates providing



49

US\\\MESSIRY\\\13377947.17

* * *





benefits to any Continuing Employee after the Effective Time (the "New
Plans"), each Continuing Employee shall receive full credit for such
Continuing Employee's years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries
before the Effective Time (including predecessor or acquired entities or any
other entities for which the Company and its Subsidiaries have given credit
for prior service), to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
entitled, prior to the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan (except with respect to accruals
under a defined benefit pension plan or any plan or arrangement that provides
retiree medical benefits, or to the extent such credit would result in a
duplication of accrual of benefits). In addition, where applicable, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, subject to (A) Parent
receiving all information necessary with respect to the Continuing Employees
and (B) any required approval of the applicable insurer, which Parent agrees
to use or cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiaries or Affiliates to
use, reasonable best efforts to obtain: (i) at the Effective Time, each
Continuing Employee immediately shall be eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in each New Plan to the extent such waiting time was satisfied
under a similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the "Old Plans"); (ii) Parent shall cause all pre-existing
condition exclusions or limitations and actively-at-work requirements of each
New Plan that is a health plan to be waived or satisfied for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent waived or satisfied
under the analogous Old Plan as of the Effective Time; and (iii) for the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs Parent shall cause all eligible
expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such Continuing Employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan.

(g)With respect to any accrued but unused paid time off to which any
Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the paid time off policy
applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, (i) allow such Continuing Employee
to use such accrued paid time off in accordance with the terms of the
Company's paid time off policy provided to Parent prior to the date hereof and
(ii) if any Continuing Employee's employment terminates during the
Continuation Period under circumstances entitling the Continuing Employee to
severance pay under a Company Severance Plan, pay the Continuing Employee, in
cash, an amount for a number of days of paid time off calculated as follows:
(A) the number of accrued days of paid time off to which the Continuing
Employee is entitled as of the date of such termination, and (B) reducing this
number by the number of days of paid time off actually used by the Continuing
Employee prior to the date of termination.

(h)If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Company Board (or the
appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such corporate
action as



50

US\\\MESSIRY\\\13377947.17

* * *





is necessary to terminate the Company's 401(k) plan (the "Company 401(k)
Plan"), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. To the extent the
Company 401(k) Plan is terminated pursuant to Parent's request, the Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan maintained by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as soon as reasonably practicable following
the Closing Date, and shall be entitled to effect a direct rollover of their
account balances (including any outstanding loans) to such 401(k) plan
maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries.

(i)Nothing in this Section 6.5, whether express or implied, shall: (i) confer
upon any current or former employee of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including
any Continuing Employee), the right to employment or continued employment or
any term or condition of employment for any specified period, of any nature or
kind whatsoever, or restrict the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to terminate the
employment or service of any Person; (ii) be construed to establish, amend, or
modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, Contract, policy
or arrangement; (iii) limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, Contract,
policy or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them; or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights
or obligations in any Person (including any employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) other than the parties to this Agreement.

Section 6.6 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

(a)The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation now existing in favor of any present or former director,
officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the
fiduciaries of any Company Benefit Plans (the "Indemnified Parties") as
provided in (i) the Company Organizational Documents or any comparable
organizational document of any of the Subsidiaries of the Company or (ii)
agreements between an Indemnified Party and the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries, to survive the Merger and to continue in full force and effect
for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time or, if
longer, for such period as is set forth in any applicable agreement with an
Indemnified Party in effect on the date of this Agreement.

(b)The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless all Indemnified Parties to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law with respect to all acts and
omissions arising out of or relating to their services as directors, officers
or employees of the Company, its Subsidiaries or another Person, if such
Indemnified Party is or was serving as a director, officer or employee of such
other Person at the request of the Company, or fiduciaries of the Company
Benefit Plans, whether asserted or claimed at or after or occurring before the
Effective Time (including in connection with the negotiation and execution of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions or otherwise). If any
Indemnified



51

US\\\MESSIRY\\\13377947.17

* * *





Party is or becomes involved in any Legal Action in connection with any matter
subject to indemnification hereunder, then the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance as incurred any
costs or expenses (including legal fees and disbursements), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, amounts paid in settlement, Taxes or Liabilities
("Damages") arising out of or incurred in connection with such Legal Action,
subject to the Surviving Corporation's receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such Damages if it is ultimately
determined under applicable Law that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
be indemnified. In the event of any such Legal Action, (i) the Surviving
Corporation may elect to control the defense of any such Legal Action and (ii)
the Surviving Corporation shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry
of any judgment on behalf of an Indemnified Party in any Legal Action pending
or threatened in writing against such Indemnified Party (and in respect of
which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder),
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all Liability arising out of such Legal
Action or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). No Indemnified Party may
settle, compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment in any proceeding
or threatened Legal Action in which indemnification may be sought by an
Indemnified Party hereunder without the prior written consent of the Surviving
Corporation, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(c)Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in
effect for at least six (6) years after the Effective Time the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance ("DandO Insurance")
maintained by the Company or policies of at least the same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous with
respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before
or at the Effective Time (including in connection with the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions) so long
as the Surviving Corporation is not required to pay an annual premium in
excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such
insurance before the date of this Agreement (such 300% amount being the
"Maximum Premium"). If the Surviving Corporation is unable to obtain the
insurance described in the prior sentence for an amount less than or equal to
the Maximum Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall be
entitled to cause the Surviving Corporation to, instead obtain as much
comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to the Maximum
Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of the arrangements
contemplated by this Section 6.6(c), before the Effective Time, the Company or
Parent shall purchase a "tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy, with the amount paid for such policy not exceeding the Maximum
Premium, covering the matters described in this Section 6.6(c) with terms,
conditions, retentions, and levels of coverage identical to the Company's
existing DandO Insurance and, once the Company or Parent purchases such a policy
before the Effective Time, then the Surviving Corporation's obligations under
this Section 6.6(c) shall be satisfied so long as the Surviving Corporation
causes such policy to be maintained in effect for a period of six (6) years
following the Effective Time.

(d)The covenants contained in this Section 6.6 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
their respective heirs and legal representatives and shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise.

(e)In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, take
all necessary action so that the successors or assigns of the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.6.

Section 6.7 Reasonable Best Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with applicable Law,
each of the parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, such
actions and to do, or cause to be done (and assist and cooperate with the
other party in doing), such things as are necessary, proper or advisable to
ensure that the Offer Conditions and conditions set forth in Article VII are
satisfied and to consummate the Transactions as promptly as reasonably
practicable; provided, that, (i) prior to the Acceptance Time, in no event
shall the Company or its Subsidiaries be required to pay, or otherwise incur
any Liability with respect to, any fees (except for customary fees to
Governmental Authorities), penalties or other consideration to obtain any
consent or approval required for the consummation of the Transactions and (ii)
no party shall be required to waive any right or remedy under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of this Section 6.7 shall not limit
the rights of the Company, Parent or Purchaser set forth in this Agreement.

Section 6.8 Consents; Filings; Further Action.

(a)Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with applicable Law, each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly (i) obtain any consents, approvals or other
authorizations, and make any filings and notifications, required in connection
with the Transactions, (ii) make any other submissions either required or
deemed appropriate by either Parent or the Company in connection with the
Transactions under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Antitrust Laws,
the DGCL, the Applicable Exchange rules and regulations and any other
applicable Law and (iii) take or cause to be taken such actions as are
necessary, proper or advisable consistent with this Section 6.8 to cause
receipt of required consents, approvals or authorizations, as applicable,
under such Laws as soon as reasonably practicable, other than, in each case,
with respect to filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents, approvals,
consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations
relating to Antitrust Laws, which are dealt with in Section 6.8(b) and Section
6.8(c). The parties shall cooperate and



53

US\\\MESSIRY\\\13377947.17

* * *





consult with each other in connection with the making of all such filings and
notifications, including by providing copies of, and an opportunity to review
and comment on (and shall consider in good faith all such comments reasonably
proposed), all relevant filing and other documents to the non-filing party and
its advisors before filing.

(b)Subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 6.8, each of the
parties hereto agrees: (i) to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions within
ten (10) days after the date of this Agreement, (ii) to supply as promptly as
reasonably practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be reasonably requested pursuant to the HSR Act and (iii) to promptly
take such steps as are necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment and obtain all consents under any such Antitrust Laws that may be
required by any Governmental Authority, in each case with competent
jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties hereto to consummate the
Transactions. Subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 6.8, and
without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties shall promptly take such
reasonable actions as are necessary to secure the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and resolve any objections
asserted with respect to the Transactions under the applicable Antitrust Laws
or by any Governmental Authority in order to prevent the entry of, any Law or
Order that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of the
Transactions; provided, in each case, that neither the Company nor Parent
shall have any obligation to undertake any such activity that is inconsistent
with the standard set forth in Section 6.8(d). Each party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to defend any Legal Action brought or threatened to be
brought by any Person (including any Governmental Authority) in order to avoid
entry of, or to have vacated, lifted or terminated, any Order that would
prevent the consummation of the Transactions from occurring prior to the
Termination Date. Subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 6.8,
each of the parties shall promptly respond to and seek to resolve as promptly
as reasonably practicable any objections asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Transactions. Parent shall not consent to any
voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any
voluntary delay of the consummation of the Transactions at the behest of any
Governmental Authority without the consent of the Company, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Nothing in this
Agreement shall require any party hereto to take or agree to take any action
with respect to its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such
agreement or action is conditioned upon the Closing.

(c)Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all material respects with each other in connection with any
filing, communication or submission to or with a Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions and in connection with any investigation,
litigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to
the Transactions, including any proceeding initiated by a private Person,
including by providing the other party with copies of, and an opportunity to
review and comment on (and shall consider in good faith all such comments
reasonably proposed), all relevant filings, written communications and other
documents in connection therewith, (ii) keep the other parties hereto informed
in all



54

US\\\MESSIRY\\\13377947.17

* * *





material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the FTC,
the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, in
each case regarding any of the Transactions, (iii) subject to applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, consult with the other parties hereto
with respect to information relating to the other parties hereto and their
respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third Person or any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions and (iv) unless prohibited by
the applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other parties
hereto the opportunity to attend and participate in all meetings and
conferences with such Governmental Authority or other Person, including by
providing the other party with copies of, and an opportunity to review and
comment on (and shall consider in good faith all such comments reasonably
proposed), all relevant filings, written communications and other documents in

action, if the taking of such action, individually or in the aggregate, would

(a)

(i)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and

Financing on the terms and conditions (including the "market flex" provisions,
provided that such provisions do not reduce the amount (except by modifying
original issue discount of the Transaction Financing) or adversely affect the
availability of the Transaction Financing to be funded at Closing or the
ability of Parent and the Purchaser to timely pay the Required Payment Amount
as contemplated by this Agreement) described in the Commitment Letter at
Closing, and shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
agree to or permit the termination of the Commitment Letter or the definitive
agreements relating to the Transaction Financing, or agree to or permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under,
the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements relating to the Transaction
Financing, that (i) reduces the aggregate amount of the Transaction



57

US\\\MESSIRY\\\13377947.17

* * *





Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount of the Transaction Financing or similar fees) or (ii)(A)
imposes new or additional conditions precedent or (B) otherwise adversely
expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions precedent to the Transaction
Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other provision of the
Commitment Letter, in the case of clauses (A) and (B), in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (x) delay, prevent or impede the ability of Parent
and Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(y) make the timely funding of the Transaction Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter (or satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the
Transaction Financing) or the timely payment of the Required Payment Amount as
contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing Date less likely to occur or (z)
adversely impact the ability of each of Parent and Purchaser to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letter or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto (provided that, without the consent of the
Company, Parent and Purchaser may amend the Commitment Letter (1) to favorably
modify pricing terms or add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners and
agents or (2) to implement or exercise any of the "market flex" provisions
(including pricing terms) contained in the fee letter executed in connection
with the Commitment Letter), if such amendments do not reduce the amount
(except by exercising "market flex" to modify original issue discount of the
Transaction Financing) or adversely affect the availability of the Transaction
Financing to be funded at Closing or the ability of Parent and Purchaser to
timely pay the Required Payment Amount as contemplated by this Agreement.
Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment,
modification or replacement. For purposes of this Section 6.16, references to
"Transaction Financing" shall include the Transaction Financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by
this Section 6.16(a) and references to "Commitment Letter" shall include such
documents as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this Section
6.16(a).

(ii)Each of Parent and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts (A) to
maintain in effect the Commitment Letter and comply with its obligations
thereunder, (B) to enter into definitive agreements pursuant to the Commitment
Letter or the Engagement Letters, as applicable, consistent in all material
respects with the terms and conditions (including the "market flex"
provisions, provided that such provisions do not adversely affect the
availability of the Transaction Financing to be funded at Closing or the
ability of Parent and Purchaser to timely pay the Required Payment Amount as
contemplated by this Agreement) contained in the Commitment Letter or the
Engagement Letters, as applicable (or on terms no less favorable (taken as a
whole) to Parent and Purchaser than the terms and conditions (including
"market flex" provisions) in the Commitment Letter or the Engagement Letters,
as applicable), and (C) to satisfy (or obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis
all conditions precedent to funding in the Commitment Letter and such
definitive agreements that are within Parent's control and to consummate the
Transaction Financing at the Closing. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
informed in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Transaction Financing and, upon Company's written request, shall provide to
the Company copies of the material definitive agreements with respect to the
Transaction Financing. Without limiting the



58

US\\\MESSIRY\\\13377947.17

* * *





generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give the Company prompt notice (x)
of any material breach or default by any party to any of the Commitment Letter
or definitive agreements with respect to the Transaction Financing of which
Parent has knowledge, (y) of the receipt of (A) any written notice or (B)
other written communication, in each case from any Financing Source with
respect to any actual or potential material breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to any of the Commitment Letter or definitive
agreements with respect to the Transaction Financing of any provisions of the
Commitment Letter or definitive agreements with respect to the Transaction
Financing, and (z) if at any time for any reason Parent believes in good faith
that it will not be able to timely pay the Required Payment Amount as
contemplated by this Agreement or to obtain all or any portion of the
Transaction Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated by any of the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements
related to the Transaction Financing. As soon as reasonably practicable after
any notice by Parent to the Company of the type described in the immediately
preceding sentence, but in any event within two Business Days of the date the
Company delivers to Parent a written request, Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to provide any information reasonably requested by the Company
relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the
immediately preceding sentence; provided, in the event that Parent is required
pursuant to this Section 6.16(a) to provide any information that is subject to
attorney-client or similar privilege, Parent may withhold disclosure of such
information so long as Parent gives notice to the Company of the fact that it
is withholding such information and thereafter the Company and Parent shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be
provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to waive the
applicable privilege or protection. If all or any portion of the Transaction
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms contemplated by the Commitment
Letter (including any "market flex" provisions applicable to the Transaction
Financing) for any reason, and such portion is reasonably required to pay the
Required Payment Amount, then Parent shall promptly notify the Company and
Parent and Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain in replacement thereof alternative debt Transaction Financing from
alternative sources in an amount sufficient, when taken together with
available cash of Parent and any then-available Transaction Financing pursuant
to the Commitment Letter, to fund the Required Payment Amount with terms and
conditions (including after giving effect to any "market flex" provisions) not
materially less favorable (taken as a whole) to Parent and Purchaser than the
terms and conditions (taken as a whole) set forth in the Commitment Letter
("Available Transaction Financing"), as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall deliver to the Company
true and complete copies of all commitment letters and fee letters pursuant to
which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide any portion
of the Available Transaction Financing. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 6.16 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to
Section 6.16(b)), in no event shall the "reasonable best efforts" of Parent
and Purchaser be deemed or construed to require any such Person to, and no
such Person shall be required to, pay any debt financing fees in the aggregate
in excess of those contemplated by the Commitment Letter, or agree to
conditionality or economic terms of debt financing that are (other than as
specified in the preceding



59

US\\\MESSIRY\\\13377947.17

* * *





sentence) materially less favorable than those contemplated by the Commitment
Letter or any related fee letter (including any "market flex" provision
therein).

(b)Each of Parent and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of
any Transaction Financing or any alternative financing is not a condition to
the Offer or the Merger and reaffirms its obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of
the availability of the Transaction Financing or any alternative financing.

(c)Prior to Closing, at Parent's sole cost and expense, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to provide, and
use reasonable best efforts to cause its and the Company's Subsidiaries'
respective Representatives to provide, to Parent and Purchaser such reasonable

Section 9.12 Severability. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed

purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of
this Agreement and the application of that provision to other Persons or
circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of that provision, or the application of that provision, in any
other jurisdiction.

Section 9.13 Rules of Construction. The parties have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting this Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. Subject to and without limiting the introductory
language to Article IV and Article V, each party to this Agreement has or may
have set forth information in its respective disclosure letter in a section of
such disclosure letter that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to
which it relates. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in a
disclosure letter to this Agreement shall not constitute an admission by such
party that such item is material, that such item has had or would have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case
may be, or that the disclosure of such be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

Section 9.14 Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted successors and
assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign or delegate, by operation of

Section 9.15 Specific Performance. The parties to this Agreement agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that the parties to this
Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Chosen Courts, this being in
addition to any other remedy at law or in equity, and the parties to this
Agreement shall not be required to prove actual damages and hereby waive any
requirement for the posting of any bond or similar collateral in connection
therewith. Each party hereto agrees that it will not assert that a remedy of
specific performance is unenforceable or invalid or otherwise oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that (a) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity.

Section 9.16 Non-Recourse. Subject to the rights of the parties to the
Commitment Letter under the terms thereof, none of the Persons that are
expressly identified as parties in the preamble to this Agreement (the
"Contracting Parties"), nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall have any
rights or claims against any Financing Source, in connection with this
Agreement, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. For
the avoidance of doubt, none of the Financing Sources, nor or any of the
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives, and no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney or representative
of any such Financing Source shall have any liability for any obligations or
liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim (whether
in contract, tort or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of (or
in any way relating to), the transactions contemplated hereby, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter, the
transactions contemplated thereby or the performance thereof and the parties
hereto agree not to assert any such claim or bring any action, suit or
proceeding in connection with any such claim against any Financing Source or
any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives or any of their respective past, present or future directors,
officers, employees, incorporators, members, partners, stockholders,
Affiliates, agents, attorneys or representatives.

Section 9.17 Obligations of Parent. Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt
and faithful performance and discharge by, and compliance with, all of the
obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of Purchaser under
this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, including any and all
monetary and other payment obligations and any such obligations, covenants,
terms, conditions and undertakings that are required to be performed,
discharged or complied with following the Effective Time by the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 9.18 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, as if the signatures to each counterpart were upon
a single instrument, and all such counterparts together shall be deemed an

Offer Conditions

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or the Offer, Purchaser
shall not be required to (and Parent shall not be required to cause Purchaser
to) accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC including Rule 14e-1(c), pay for any Shares validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer if any of the following conditions
exist or have occurred and are continuing at the scheduled Expiration Time of
the Offer:

(a)Minimum Tender Condition. The number of Shares validly tendered (and not
properly withdrawn) prior to the expiration of the Offer (but excluding shares
tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been
"received," as defined by Section 251(h)(6) of the DGCL), together with the
Shares then owned by Parent and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries, do not
represent at least one Share more than 50% of the then outstanding Shares (the
"Minimum Tender Condition").

(b)Legal Restraints. Any Restraint Authority shall have issued any Order, or
any applicable Law or other legal restraint or prohibition of any such
Governmental Authority shall be in effect, in each case that enjoins or
otherwise prohibits consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

(c)Company Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of this Agreement, there
has been any change, effect, event, occurrence, state of facts, or development
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(d)Governmental Consents. Any waiting period (including any extension thereof)
under the Antitrust Laws applicable to the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger shall not have expired or been terminated, or all applicable consents
required under applicable Antitrust Law shall have not been obtained.

(e)Representations and Warranties. (i) the representations and warranties of
the Company contained in Section 4.1 (Organization and Power), Section 4.3
(Corporate Authorization), Section 4.4 (Enforceability), Section 4.8(a)
(Capitalization) and Section 4.26 (Brokers) shall not be true and correct
(except in each case for any de minimis inaccuracy) and (ii) all other
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement
shall not be true and correct in all respects, without regard to any
"materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifications contained in
them, at and as of the Acceptance Time, as though made on and as of such date
(except for representations and warranties made as of a specified date, the
accuracy of which shall be determined as of that specified date), with only
such exceptions as would not individually or in the aggregate have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall not have received a certificate signed
on behalf of the Company by an executive officer of the Company to such
effect.

(f)Compliance with Covenants. The Company shall not have complied with or
performed in all material respects its obligations, agreements and







US\\\MESSIRY\\\13377947.17 Annex I





covenants required to be complied with or performed by it prior to the
Acceptance Time under the Agreement and such failure to comply or perform
shall not have been cured by the Acceptance Time. Parent shall not have
received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by an executive officer
of the Company to such effect.

(g)No Termination of Agreement. The Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with its terms.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Purchaser and,
other than the Minimum Tender Condition, may be waived by Parent and Purchaser
in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their respective sole
discretion, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and to the extent permitted by applicable Law. The failure by Parent,
Purchaser or any other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of
any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be
deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each
such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.

The capitalized terms used in this Annex I shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement to which it is annexed unless specifically defined in this
Annex I.
