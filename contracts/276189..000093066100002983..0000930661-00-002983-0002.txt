     of Parent, designated as CD common stock ("Parent Common Stock"), has been
     effectively made and not revoked pursuant to Section 2.2 ("Stock Election")
     and for each Non-Electing Share (as defined in subsection (iv) below), the
     right to receive 1.2500 (the "Initial Exchange Ratio" and as adjusted
     pursuant to Section 2.3 and this subsection (i), the "Exchange Ratio")
     fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock (as may be
     adjusted pursuant to the remainder of this subsection (i), the "Stock
     Election Consideration"); provided, however, that (x) if the Average
                               --------  -------
     Trading Price (as defined below) is between $12.0 and $13.5960, then the
     Exchange Ratio shall be equal to the sum of (a) the Initial Exchange Ratio
     divided by two, and (b) the quotient of $7.5 divided by the Average Trading
     Price, (y) if the Average Trading Price is equal to, or greater than,
     $13.5960,  then the Exchange Ratio shall be equal to the quotient of $16
     divided by the Average Trading Price and (z) if the Average Trading Price
     is below $12.0, then the Exchange Ratio shall be equal to the quotient of
     $15 divided by the Average Trading Price; provided, further, that if the
                                               --------  -------
     Average Trading Price of Parent Common Stock is $7.00 or less, the Exchange
     Ratio will be 2.1428.  As used herein, the "Average Trading Price" shall
     mean the arithmetic average of the 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time closing sales
     prices of Parent Common Stock reported on the New York Stock Exchange
     ("NYSE") Composite Tape for the 20 consecutive NYSE trading days (each, a
     "Trading Day") ending on (and including) the Trading Day immediately prior
     to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting (as defined herein).

              (ii)  For each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which
     an election to receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked
     pursuant to Section 2.2 ("Cash Election"), the right to receive $15 in
     cash, subject to proration pursuant to subsection (iii) below (the "Cash
     Election Consideration"); provided, however, that in the event that the
                               --------  -------
     Average Trading Price is greater than $12.0, for each share of Company
     Common Stock with respect to which a Cash Election was made and not subject
     to proration, in addition to the Cash Election Consideration received with
     respect to such share,

                                       4
<PAGE>

     there shall be a right to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
     Stock which shall equal the value, based on the Average Trading Price, of
     the Stock Election Consideration minus $15 (the "Additional Stock
     Consideration"); provided, further, that the Additional Stock Consideration
                      --------  -------
     shall not exceed $1.

               (iii)  The manner in which each share of Company Common Stock
     (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled as set forth in
     Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares) for which a Cash Election has been
     made shall be converted into the right to receive either the Cash Election
     Consideration and Additional Stock Consideration, if any, or the Stock
     Election Consideration on the Effective Date shall be as set forth in this
     subsection (iii). All references to "outstanding" shares of Company Common
     Stock in this subsection (iii) shall mean all shares of Company Common
     Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

                       (A) As is more fully set forth below and except as
          provided in Section 2.1(c)(v), the aggregate amount of cash which
          Parent shall be obligated to pay in the Merger pursuant to this
          Agreement (other than in respect of Dissenting Shares) shall not be
          more than the product of multiplying $7.5 by the number of outstanding
          shares of the Company's Common Stock (the "Total Cash Actual"). "Total
          Cash Potential" shall mean the sum of (1) the aggregate Cash Election
          Consideration elected by stockholders of the Company, and (2) a cash
          amount equal to the number of Dissenting Shares multiplied by the
          value, based on the Average Trading Price, of the Stock Election
          Consideration.

                       (B) If the Total Cash Potential is equal to or less than
          the Total Cash Actual, each share of Company Common Stock covered by a
          Cash Election shall be converted in the Merger into the right to
          receive the Cash Election Consideration and the Additional Stock
          Consideration, if any.

                       (C) If the Total Cash Potential is greater than the Total
          Cash Actual, each share of Company Common Stock covered by a Cash
          Election shall be converted in the Merger into the right to receive
          the Cash Election Consideration and the Stock Election Consideration
          in the following manner:

                           (a) The Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 2.2(d)
          below) will distribute with respect to each share of Company Common
          Stock as to which a Cash Election has been made the Cash Election
          Consideration multiplied by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which
          shall be the product of multiplying (A) $15 by (B) 50.0% of the number
          of outstanding shares of Com-

                                       5
<PAGE>

          pany Common Stock minus the product of multiplying (C) the number of
          Dissenting Shares by (D) the value, based on the Average Trading
          Price, of the Stock Election Consideration, and (y) the denominator of
          which shall be the aggregate Cash Election Consideration elected by
          stockholders of the Company; and

                           (b) Each share of Company Common Stock covered by a
          Cash Election and not fully converted into the right to receive the
          Cash Election Consideration as set forth in clause (a) above shall be
          converted in the Merger into the right to receive a fraction of a
          share of Parent Common Stock which shall equal the value, based on the
          Average Trading Price, of the sum of (x) the product of multiplying
          (A) the Stock Election Consideration by (B) a fraction equal to 1.0
          minus the fraction set forth in clause (a) above plus (y) the product
          of multiplying (A) the value, based on the Average Trading Price, of
          the Additional Stock Consideration, if any, by (B) the fraction set
          forth in clause (a) above, subject to subsection (v) below.

               (iv)    Each share of Company Common Stock for which a valid
     Stock Election has been received and each share of Company Common Stock for
     which an Election (as defined in Section 2.2 below) is not in effect at the
     Election Deadline (a "Non-Electing Share"), shall be converted into the
     right to receive the Stock Election Consideration in the Merger, subject to
     subsection (v) below. If Parent and the Company shall determine that any
     Election is not properly made with respect to any shares of Company Common
     Stock, such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of
     Company Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof,
     be deemed to be Non-Electing Shares.

               (v)     Notwithstanding subsections (i) through (iv) above,
     Parent shall have the right, exercisable at any time at least two business
     days prior to the Closing, at Parent's sole discretion, to pay in cash for
     any shares for which an Election (as defined below) was made and to
     substitute on a pro rata basis a payment of cash in an amount equal to the
     Average Trading Price multiplied by the Exchange Ratio for any or all
     shares of Company Common Stock for which the Stock Election has been made
     or which would otherwise be converted into Parent Common Stock pursuant to
     Section 2.1(c)(iii)(C); provided, that prior to making such substitution,
                             --------
     Parent shall first have paid in cash for all shares for which a Cash
     Election has been made and which were not fully converted into the right to
     receive the Cash Election Consideration.

          SECTION 2.2      Election Procedure.  Each holder of shares of Company
                           ------------------
Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) shall have the right, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article II, to submit an Election (as defined
below) in accordance with the following procedures (as used in this Section 2.2,
"holder" shall mean "record holder"):

                                       6
<PAGE>

          (a) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock may specify in a
request made in accordance with the provisions of this Section (herein called an
"Election") (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such
holder with respect to which such holder desires to make a Stock Election and
(B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such holder with
respect to which such holder desires to make a Cash Election.

          (b) Parent shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to the Company
(the "Form of Election") which shall be mailed to the Company's stockholders
entitled to vote at the Company Stockholders Meeting so as to permit the
Company's stockholders to exercise their right to make an Election prior to the
Election Deadline (as defined in subsection (d)).

          (c) Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to make the Form of
Election initially available to all stockholders of the Company at least twenty
business days prior to the Election Deadline and shall use all reasonable
efforts to make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any
stockholder of the Company who requests such Form of Election following the
initial mailing of the Forms of Election and prior to the Election Deadline.

          (d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the person
authorized to receive Elections and to act as exchange agent under this
Agreement, which person shall be designated by Parent (the "Exchange Agent"),
shall have received, by 5:00 p.m. local time in the city in which the principal
office of such Exchange Agent is located, on the date of the Election Deadline,
a Form of Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by certificates
of the shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company Stock Certificates") to
which such Form of Election relates or by an appropriate guarantee of delivery
of such certificates, as set forth in such Form of Election, from a member of
any registered national securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust
company in the United States; provided, that such certificates are in fact
                              --------
delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of
delivery.  Failure to deliver shares of Company Common Stock covered by such a
guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be
deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election.  As used herein,
"Election Deadline" means the date on which the Effective Time occurs.

          (e) Any Company stockholder may at any time prior to the Election
Deadline change his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and
signed, revised Form of Election.

          (f) Any Company stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election
Deadline, revoke his or her Election by written notice received by the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election
Deadline of his or her Company Stock Certificate, or of the guarantee of
delivery of such certificates, previously deposited with the Exchange Agent.
All Elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent is

                                       7
<PAGE>

notified in writing by Parent or the Company that this Agreement has been
terminated in accordance with Article VII.

          (g) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a
person other than the person in whose name a Company Stock Certificate so
surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that such
Company Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes (as defined in Section 3.1(m))
required as a result of such payment to a person other than the registered
holder of such Company Stock Certificate, or establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

          (h) After the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock.  If after the Effective Time,
Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Article II.

          (i) At any time following the first anniversary of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to
deliver to it any remaining portion of the Merger Consideration not distributed
to holders of shares of Company Common Stock that was deposited with the
Exchange Agent at the Effective Time (the "Exchange Fund")  (including any
interest received with respect thereto and other income resulting from
investments by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Parent), and holders shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws) with respect to the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and
any dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock payable
upon due surrender of their Company Stock Certificates, without any interest
thereon.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Company Stock Certificate
for Merger Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash from the Exchange Fund in each case delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

          (j) In the event any Company Stock Certificates shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Company Stock Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such sum as
Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock
Certificate(s), the Exchange Agent will issue the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificates.

          (k) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered

                                       8
<PAGE>

Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to subsection (l) below, and all such
dividends, other distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included
in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Company Stock
Certificate in accordance with subsection (l) below. Subject to the effect of
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of
any such Company Stock Certificate there shall be paid to the holder of a
certificate for Parent Common Stock (a "Parent Stock Certificate") representing
whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefore, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to subsection (l), and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock. Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent cash for these
purposes, if necessary.

          (l) No Parent Stock Certificates representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company
Stock Certificates; no dividend or distribution by Parent shall relate to such
fractional share interests; and such fractional share interests will not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a shareholder of Parent. In lieu
of any such fractional shares, each holder of a Company Stock Certificate who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share interest in
exchange for such Company Stock Certificate shall receive from the Exchange
Agent an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the
fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all
shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time) would
otherwise be entitled by (B) the Average Trading Price.  Parent shall provide
the Exchange Agent the aggregate amount of cash payable pursuant to this
subsection (l) promptly following the Effective Time.

          (m) Parent shall have the right to make rules, not inconsistent with
the terms of this Agreement, governing (A) the validity of the Forms of
Election, (B) the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into
account in making the determinations prescribed by Section 2.1, (C) the issuance
and delivery of Parent Stock Certificates into which shares of Company Common
Stock are converted in the Merger and (D) the method of payment of cash for
shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash
Election Consideration.

          (n) Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will deposit with the
Exchange Agent an amount of cash and shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to
pay in a timely manner, and the Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to
timely pay, the aggregate Cash Election Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and

                                       9
<PAGE>

the aggregate Additional Stock Consideration and Stock Election Consideration.
Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Company Stock Certificate or Company
Stock Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Form of Election, a
holder of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the
Election Deadline the Merger Consideration (elected or deemed elected by it,
subject to Sections 1.2 and 2.1) in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by its Company Stock Certificate. Until so surrendered, each
such Company Stock Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all
purposes, only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

          SECTION 2.3      Certain Adjustments.  If after the date hereof and on
                           -------------------
or prior to the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by
reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, combination or any similar
event shall occur (including an extraordinary dividend, the record date for
payment of which occurs during the Election Period) (any such action, an
"Adjustment Event"), the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted accordingly to provide
to the holders of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock have
been converted into the right to receive either Stock Election Consideration or
Additional Stock Consideration the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such reclassification, recapitalization, combination or
similar event.

          SECTION 2.4      Shares of Dissenting Stockholders. Notwithstanding
                           ---------------------------------
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock
that are issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a
stockholder who has properly exercised his appraisal rights under the DGCL (the
"Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration unless and until the holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost, his right to dissent from the Merger under
the DGCL and to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with
respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the requirements of
the DGCL.  If any such holder shall have so failed to perfect or have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right, each share of such holder's Company
Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without any interest
thereon, the Stock Election Consideration or the Cash Election Consideration or
a combination thereof as determined by Parent in its sole discretion.  The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notice or demands for
appraisal or payment for shares of Company Common Stock received by the Company
and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands or notices.  The Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands.

          SECTION 3.1      Representations and Warranties of the Company.
                           ---------------------------------------------
Except as set forth on the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule") and making reference to the particular subsection of this Agreement
to which exception is being taken (regardless of whether such subsection refers

Parent as follows:

     recognize such concept) under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
     organized and has the requisite corporate or other power, as the case may
     be, and authority to carry on its business as now being conducted.  Each of
     the Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do
     business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature
     of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties
     makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those
     jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or to be in
     good standing individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be
     expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company or the applicable
     subsidiary.

                   (ii)  The Company has delivered or provided to Parent prior
     to the execution of this Agreement complete and correct copies of its

     party to or bound by (i) any agreement relating to the incurring of
     indebtedness, (ii) any "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item
     601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), (iii) any non-competition
     agreement or any other agreement or obligation which purports to limit in
     any material respect the manner in which, or the localities in which, all

     ordinary course of business, (v) any joint venture, partnership or similar
     document or agreement, (vi) any agreement that limits or purports to limit
     the ability of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to own, operate,

     ship that requires payment of at least $1,000,000 thereunder by the Company
     or any of its subsidiaries or which is not cancellable by either party
     thereto on 30 days' notice or (xiv) any contract or other agreement not

     Contract is valid and binding on the Company (or, to the extent a
     subsidiary of the Company is a party, such subsidiary) and is in full force
     and effect. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in a
     material breach or default under any Company Material Contract. Neither the
     Company nor any subsidiary of the Company knows of, or has received notice
     of, any material violation or default under (nor, to the knowledge of the
     Company, does there exist any condition which with the passage of time or

     under) any Company Material Contract by the other party thereto.

     commitment, judgment, injunction, order or decree to which the Company or
     any of its subsidiaries or affiliates is a party or which is otherwise

     or reasonably would be expected to have the effect of prohibiting or
     impairing any business practice of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
     or affiliates, any acquisition of property (tangible or intangible) by the
     Company or any of its subsidiaries.

          Subsidiaries Statements, are (except to the extent reserved against in
          such financial statements, which reserves have been determined based
          upon actual prior and current experience and are consistent with prior
          practices) valid, genuine and subsisting, arise out of bona fide sales
          of VOIs, goods, performance of services or other business transactions
          relating to the sale of VOIs and are not subject to defenses, setoffs,
          counterclaims or rights of rescission that would reasonably be

          Receivables owned by the Company and its subsidiaries are owned free
          and clear of all Liens for funded indebtedness. "VOI Receivables"
          shall mean, with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries,

          any contracts for deed, deeds of trust, promissory notes, installment
          notes, mortgages or similar security instruments and all related
          documents and instruments (including, without limitation, any security
          agreements entered into in connection with or a part of any purchase
          agreement or any installment sales contract relating to the sale of a
          VOI) creating a first and prior lien on a VOI and securing a purchase

          installment sales contract creating a purchaser's beneficial or
          equitable interest in a VOI (collectively with the Mortgages, the
          "Debt Instruments"). For purposes of this Agreement, "VOI" shall mean
          a fee simple or leasehold ownership interest in a condominium unit or
          an entire timeshare resort developed or acquired by the Company or a
          subsidiary of the Company, coupled with the right to use and occupy

          include all rights, benefits, privileges, obligations and liabilities
          granted to or imposed upon the owner of a VOI with respect to the
          Company's FairShare Plus Program (the "Program"), pursuant to the
          Amended and Restated FairShare Vacation Plan Use Management Trust
          Agreement dated as of January 1, 1996, as amended (the "Trust
          Agreement") or under applicable VOI Laws.

          sets forth certain reports (the "Reports") routinely prepared by the
          Company or any of its subsidiaries that identify, as of the date
          indicated in the Reports, (i) the aggregate amount of VOI Receivables
          owned or pledged as security by each of the Company or its
          subsidiaries identified in the Reports and (ii) the weighted average
          maturity of such VOI Receivables. The Reports are true, accurate and
          complete in all material respects.

                    (ii)   Registrations.  Set forth on Section 3.1(g) of the
                           -------------
     Company Disclosure Schedule are all the resorts where each of the Company
     or any of its subsidiaries owns VOIs and each jurisdiction in which each of
     those resorts is registered, other than an inadvertent omission of a
     jurisdiction, for (i) the ownership of any VOI or real estate or (ii) the
     advertising, marketing or selling of VOIs by the Company or its
     subsidiaries or the soliciting of consumers to visit a resort or a sales
     office by the Company or its subsidiaries.

                    (iii)  Debt Instruments.
                           ----------------

                           (A) Each form that is underlying or related to a Debt
          Instrument securing or creating an equitable interest in a VOI
          Receivable reflected in the financial statements described in
          subsection (i)(A) above and that is

                                      18
<PAGE>

          routinely used by the Company and its subsidiaries or is permitted by
          the Company or its subsidiaries to be used by others in connection
          with the sale of VOIs, meets all material requirements of applicable
          VOI Laws.

                         (B) The Debt Instruments contain customary and
          enforceable provisions such as to render the rights and remedies of
          the holders thereof adequate for the practical realization against the
          related property of the principal benefits of the security or property
          interest intended to be provided thereby.

                         (C) Each Mortgage which requires recordation to perfect
          the related VOI interest has been properly recorded or is in the
          process of being recorded in the appropriate jurisdiction and is in
          material compliance with all applicable laws of the jurisdiction in
          which the related VOI is located, and all costs, fees, and expenses,
          including where applicable, recording fees, documentary stamps and
          intangible taxes, due in connection with the filing of each Mortgage
          that has been filed have been paid, except for any failures to pay
          costs, fees and expenses that would not reasonably be expected to have
          a material business impact on the Company.

               (h)  Resorts.
                    -------

                    (i)  Section 3.1(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
          contains a list of each resort where (A) the VOIs owned or otherwise
          controlled by the Company or its subsidiaries consist of more than 5%
          of the total VOI inventory at such resort and (B) the Company or any
          of its subsidiaries owns, has an option or contract for or otherwise
          controls the real estate that is intended to accommodate the
          development of VOIs in the future (the "Resorts"), indicating whether
          each Resort is owned, under option or contract or otherwise controlled
          by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

                    (ii) The Company or one of its subsidiaries, as the case may
          be, has good and marketable title in fee simple or a leasehold
          interest to all VOIs and other real estate owned by the Company free
          and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Encumbrances.  As used in
          this Agreement, "Permitted Encumbrances" means (i) Liens imposed by
          law for Taxes, assessments or charges of any Governmental Entity that
          are not yet due and payable or are being contested in good faith by
          proper proceedings (and in each case as to which adequate reserves or
          other appropriate provisions are being maintained in accordance with
          GAAP); (ii) carriers', warehousemen's, mechanics, landlords',
          materialmen's, repairmen's or other like Liens arising in the ordinary
          course of business in respect of obligations that are not yet due or
          that are bonded or that are being contested in good faith and by
          appropriate proceedings, if adequate reserves with respect thereto are
          main-

                                      19

          tained in accordance with GAAP; (iii) Liens incurred in the ordinary
          course of business in connection with workers' compensation,
          unemployment insurance and other types of social security benefits or
          to secure the performance of tenders, bids, leases, contracts,
          statutory obligations and other similar obligations; (iv) easements
          (including, without limitation, reciprocal easement agreements and
          utility agreements), rights-of-way, covenants, consents, reservations,
          encroachments, variations and zoning and other restrictions, charges,
          or encumbrances (whether or not recorded) which do not interfere
          materially with the ordinary conduct of the business of the Company
          and which do not detract materially from the property to which they
          attach or impair materially the use thereof by the Company; (v) the
          encumbrances set forth on title policies or title commitments provided
          to or made available to Parent; and (vi) extensions, renewals or
          replacements of any Lien referred to in clauses (i) through (v) above.

                    (iii)  The current use of the Resorts by the Company and its
          subsidiaries does not violate any instrument or agreement of record
          affecting the Resorts or any applicable local zoning or similar land
          use laws, except for violations that would not have a material
          business impact on the Company.  To the knowledge of the Company, none
          of the occupiable structures on the Resorts encroaches upon real
          property of another person and no occupiable structure of any other
          person encroaches upon any part of a Resort, except for encroachments
          that would not have a material business impact on the Company.

                    (iv)   To the knowledge of the Company, each Resort has
          sufficient vehicular access for its purposes.

                    (v)    There are no leases, subleases, licenses, concessions

          owner's association managed by the Company or any of its subsidiaries
          in existence with respect to a Resort (each, an "Association"), is
          duly organized, legally existing, and in good standing under the laws
          of the state of its incorporation, except where the failure to be so
          qualified would not have a material adverse effect on an Association.
          The books and records of each Association are correct and complete in
          all material respects and all funds collected from VOI owners and
          others on behalf of the Associations have been properly accounted for

          the dates indicated, and there have been no changes to the
          Association's financial conditions since the date of its most recent
          financial statements which would have a material adverse effect on the
          Association.

                    (iii)  Each Association maintains adequate reserves for
          deferred maintenance and capital improvements as set forth in the
          budget approved by such Association, in accordance with the articles
          of incorporation or by-laws of each Association and applicable VOI

          than any conflict, violation, default or termination, cancellation or
          acceleration that would not reasonably be expected to have a material
          adverse effect on the Trust or the Trustee.  All contracts or
          agreements material to the operation of the Trust to which either the
          Trustee or the Trust is a party have been delivered or made available
          to Parent.

                    (iii)  No liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA
     has been incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been

     to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such liability,
     other than liability for

     premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") (which
     premiums have been paid when due). Insofar as the representation made in
     this Section 3.1(n) applies to Sections 4064, 4069 or 4204 of Title IV of
     ERISA, it is made with respect to any employee benefit plan, program,
     agreement or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA to which the Company
     or any ERISA Affiliate made, or was required to make, contributions during
     the five (5)-year period ending on the last day of the most recent plan
     year ended prior to the Closing Date.

                    (iv)   The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate
     any Title IV Plan and no condition exists that presents a material risk
     that such proceedings will be instituted.

                    (v)    No Plan is, or ever has been, a Title IV Plan.

                    (vi)   No Title IV Plan or any trust established thereunder
     has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section
     302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the
     last day of the most recent fiscal year of each Title IV Plan ended prior
     to the Closing Date.

                    (vii)  All contributions required to be made with respect to
     any Plan on or prior to the Closing Date have been timely made or are
     reflected on the balance sheet of the Company filed with the Company SEC
     Documents. There has been no amendment to, written interpretation of or
     announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any affiliate or
     the Company or any subsidiary of the Company relating to, or change in
     employee participation or coverage under, any Plan that would increase
     materially the expense of maintaining such Plan above the level or expense
     incurred in respect thereof for the most recent fiscal year ended prior to
     the date hereof.

                    (viii) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
     contributes to, or is obligated, or has ever been obligated, to contribute
     to a "multiemployer pension plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA,
     nor is any Title IV Plan a plan described in Section 4063(a) of ERISA.

                    (ix)   Neither the Company or any subsidiary of the Company,
     any Plan, any trust created thereunder, nor, to the knowledge of the
     Company, any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction
     in connection with which the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, any
     Plan, any such trust, or any trustee or administrator thereof, or any party
     dealing with any Plan or any such trust could be subject to either a civil
     penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax
     imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code.

                                      29
<PAGE>

                    (x)    Each Plan has been operated and administered in
     accordance with its terms and applicable law in all material respects,
     including but not limited to ERISA and the Code.

                    (xi)   Each Plan intended to be "qualified" within the
     meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and the trusts
     maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the
     Code. Each Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9)
     of the Code has satisfied such requirements in all material respects.

                    (xii)  No Plan provides medical, surgical, hospitalization,
     death or similar benefits (whether or not insured) for employees or former
     employees of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for periods
     extending beyond their retirement or other termination of service, other
     than (i) coverage mandated by applicable law, (ii) death benefits under any
     "pension plan," or (iii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by the
     current or former employee (or his beneficiary).

                    (xiii) No amounts payable under the Plans will fail to be
     deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 162(m) of
     the Code.

                    (xiv)  No condition exists that would prevent the Company or
     any subsidiaries of the Company from amending or terminating any Plan
     providing health or medical benefits in respect of any active employee of
     the Company or any subsidiary of the Company without material liability.

                    (xv)   The consummation of the transactions contemplated by
     this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another event,
     (i) entitle any current or former employee or officer of the Company or any
     ERISA Affiliate to severance pay, except as expressly provided in this
     Agreement, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase
     the amount of compensation due any such employee or officer.

                    (xvi)  There has been no material failure of a Plan that is
     a group health plan (as defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) to meet
     the requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code with respect to a
     qualified beneficiary (as defined in Section 4980B(g) of the Code). Neither
     the Company nor any subsidiary of the Company has contributed to a
     nonconforming group health plan (as defined in Section 5000(a) of the Code)
     and no ERISA Affiliate of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company has
     incurred a tax under Section

                                      30
<PAGE>

     5000(a) of the Code which is or could become a material liability of the
     Company or a subsidiary of the Company.

                (xvii)  None of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company is
     a party to any employment, consulting, non-competition, severance, or
     indemnification agreement still in effect with any current or former Key
     Employee or director of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company.

                (xviii) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the
     Company, threatened or anticipated claims by or on behalf of any Plan by
     any employee or beneficiary covered under any such Plan, or otherwise
     involving any such Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).

                (xix)   Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a
     party to any agreement, contract or arrangement that could result,
     separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess parachute
     payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

          (o)   Labor Matters.  There are no labor or collective bargaining
                -------------

There is no union organizing effort pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any subsidiary of the Company. There is no
labor strike, labor dispute (other than routine employee grievances that are not
related to union employees), work slowdown, stoppage or lockout pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company. There is no unfair labor practice or labor
arbitration proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any subsidiary of the Company (other than routine

practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, and are not
engaged in any unfair labor practice.

          (p)   Environmental Liability.

                (i)   Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is in compliance

     includes the possession by the Company and its subsidiaries of all Permits
     and other governmental authorizations required under applicable
     Environmental Laws, and compliance with the terms and conditions thereof,
     except for such noncompliance that would not reasonably be expected to
     have, individually or in the aggregate, a material business impact on the
     Company. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received any
     communication or written notice, whether from a Governmental Entity,
     citizens group, employee or otherwise, that alleges that the Company or any
     of its subsidiaries is not in compliance

     Company or, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no present or past
     actions, activities, circumstances, conditions, events or incidents taken
     or caused by a third party, including the Release (as defined below) of any
     Hazardous Materials (as defined below) that could reasonably be expected to
     form the basis of any Environmental Claim against the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries or against any person or entity whose liability for any
     Environmental Claim the Company or any of its subsidiaries has or may have
     retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of law that would
     reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the
     Company.

                    (iv)  Without in any way limiting the generality of the
     foregoing, (i) all on-site and, to the knowledge of the Company, off-site

     limitations or restrictions) (collectively, "Company Software") necessary

     transactions contemplated hereby will not result in the loss of any such
     rights (or require the payment of any material additional fees or royalties
     in order to maintain such rights). Neither the Company nor any of its
     subsidiaries has received any notice of infringement of or conflict with
     and, to the Company's knowledge, there are no infringements of or

                                      34

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (other than the
DevCo. Distribution) and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and
the Stock Option Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any violation
of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give

incorporation or by-laws of the comparable organizational documents of any of
its significant subsidiaries or Merger Sub, (iii) any loan or credit agreement,

the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Company Takeover
Proposal would no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal and the
Company's Board of Directors concludes in good faith that such Company Takeover
Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a Company Superior Proposal. The
Company, its subsidiaries and their representatives

                                      45
<PAGE>

immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties with respect to any Company
Takeover Proposal.

          For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Takeover Proposal" means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to any direct or indirect
acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 20% or more of the net
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, any
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person
beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of any equity securities of the
Company, or any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company (or any
subsidiary of the Company whose business constitutes 20% or more of the net
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole), other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
securitization or financing transactions consistent with past practice. For
purposes of this Agreement, a "Company Superior Proposal" means any proposal
made by a third party (A) to acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant
to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other
disposition (including a contribution to a joint venture), dissolution or
similar transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities,
100% of the combined voting power of the shares of the Company's capital stock
then outstanding or 100% of the net revenues, net income or assets of the
Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (B) which is otherwise on
terms which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith
judgment (after consultation with (i) either Stephens Inc., Bear Stearns & Co.,
Inc. or another nationally recognized investment banking firm and (ii) outside
counsel), taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal,
that the proposal, (i) if consummated would result in a transaction that is more
favorable to the Company's stockholders from a financial point of view than the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) is reasonably
capable of being completed, including to the extent required, financing which is
then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of
the Company, is reasonably capable of being obtained by such third party.

               (b)  Except as expressly permitted by this Section 4.3, neither
the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or qualify,
in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval of the Agreement, the Merger or the
Company Recommendation (as defined in Section 5.1(d)) or take any action or make
any statement in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting inconsistent
with such approval or Company Recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the
Company Recommendation"), (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal, or (iii) cause the Company
to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement or other similar agreement (each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement")
related to any Company Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, a
Change in the Company Recommendation shall include any approval or

                                      46
<PAGE>

recommendation (or public proposal to approve or recommend), by the Company
Board of a Company Takeover Proposal, or any failure by the Company Board to
recommend against a Company Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Board of Directors of the Company, to the extent that it determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that in light of a Company
Superior Proposal it is necessary to do so in order to act in a manner
consistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under
applicable law, may terminate this Agreement solely in order to concurrently
enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to any Company Superior
Proposal, but only at a time that is after the third business day following
Parent's receipt of written notice advising Parent that the Board of Directors
of the Company is prepared to accept a Company Superior Proposal, specifying the
material terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal and identifying
the person making such Company Superior Proposal, all of which information will
be kept confidential by Parent in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 5.4).

               (c)  In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.3, the Company shall immediately advise
Parent orally and in writing of any request for information or of any Company
Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request or Company
Takeover Proposal and the identity of the person making such request or Company
Takeover Proposal. The Company will keep Parent informed of the status and
details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of any such request or
Company Takeover Proposal.

               (d)  Nothing contained in this Section 4.3 shall prohibit the
Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Company, after consultation with outside counsel, failure so to disclose would
be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law; provided, however,
                                                           --------  -------
any such disclosure relating to a Company Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to
be a Change in the Company Recommendation unless the Board of Directors of the
Company reaffirms the Company Recommendation in such disclosure.

               (b)  Each of the Company and Parent covenants that none of the

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no representation or covenant is made by the
Company with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference based on
information supplied in writing by Parent specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement and (ii) no
representation or covenant is made by Parent with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference based on information supplied in writing by the
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time there shall occur (i) any
event with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or with respect to
other information supplied by Company for inclusion in the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement or (ii) any event with respect to Parent, or with respect to
information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement, in either case, which event is required to be described in an
amendment of, or a supplement, to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, such
event shall be so described, and such amendment or supplement shall be promptly
filed with the SEC and, as required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of
Company.

               (c)  Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the
other of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other
appropriate government official and of any requests by the SEC or its staff or
any other appropriate government official for amendments or supplements to any
of the filings with the SEC in connection with the Merger and other transactions
contemplated hereby or for additional information and shall supply the other
with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of its
representatives, or Parent or any of its representatives, as the case may be, on
the one hand, and the SEC or its staff or any other appropriate government
official, on the other hand, with respect thereto. The Company and Parent shall
use their respective reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the SEC
with respect to the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable.
The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and provide to each other
all information

                                      48

necessary in order to prepare the Form S-4, the Proxy Statement and the Form 10,
and shall provide promptly to the other party any information such party may
obtain that could necessitate amending any such document.

               (d)   The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the
Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with the
DGCL for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval; provided,
                                                                    --------
that the Company may elect to postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to a
date that is no later than 35 business days after the date of mailing of the
Proxy Statement in accordance with Section 5.1(a). Subject to Section 4.3, the
Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend to the Company's stockholders
the approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Company Recommendation"). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that its
obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 5.1(d) shall not be
affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Company Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding
any Change in the Company Recommendation, this Agreement and the Merger shall be
submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting
for the purpose of approving the Agreement and the Merger and nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation unless this
Agreement has been terminated.

agreements to which the Company is subject (which the

                                      49
<PAGE>

Company will use its reasonable best efforts to have waived) and applicable law,
the Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, afford Parent and to the
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives of Parent, reasonable access during normal business hours during
the period prior to the Effective Time to all its respective properties, books,

disrupt the normal operation of the Company's financial reporting system or
violate any applicable software licenses. Parent will provide the necessary
Hyperion software to be installed on a computer in the Company's accounting
department; provided, however, that the information retrieved from the Company's

financial reporting system will not be made available to persons who are
directly involved in pricing or any other competitive activity at Parent;
provided, further, that such persons shall not use such information other than
--------  -------
for purposes of assessing the financial condition of the Company for purposes of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not share, provide or
sell the information to any third party or use the information in any manner
that could reasonably be considered a restraint on competition or result in a
violation of any applicable laws. Any information provided under this Section
5.4(b) shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

        SECTION 5.5  Reasonable Efforts.  (a)  Subject to the terms and
                     ------------------
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use its

law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and regulations

execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this

Company and Parent shall (i) take all action necessary to ensure that no state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Stock Option Agreement or the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and (ii) if any state takeover
statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement,
the Stock Option Agreement or the Merger or any other transaction contemplated
hereby and thereby, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby
and thereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on the Merger, the DevCo. Distribution and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

               (c)  Each party agrees to provide the other party with copies of
any documentation or written materials provided to or by Governmental Entities

converted into an

                                      51
<PAGE>

option or warrant, as the case may be (as applicable, an "Adjusted Option" or
"Adjusted Warrant") to purchase the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock)
equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock Option or Company Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up to
the nearest whole cent) equal to the exercise price for each such share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option or Company Warrant
divided by the Exchange Ratio, and all references in each such option or warrant
to the Company shall be deemed to refer to Parent, where appropriate; provided,
                                                                      --------
however, Parent shall assume the obligations of the Company under the applicable
-------
Company Stock Plan and agreements under which the Adjusted Option or Adjusted
Warrant was originally granted, subject to the adjustments required by this

Warrant, and the plans under which they were issued, shall continue to apply in
accordance with their terms.

               (b)  As of the Effective Time, (i) each outstanding Company Award
other than Company Stock Options and Company Warrants (including restricted

stock, stock equivalents and stock units) under the Company Stock Plans shall be
converted into the same instrument of Parent, in each case with such adjustments
(and no other adjustments) to the terms of such Company Awards as are necessary
to preserve the value inherent in such Company Awards with no detrimental or
beneficial effects on the holder thereof and (ii) Parent shall assume the
obligations of the Company under the Company Awards, subject to the adjustments
required by this Section 5.6(b). The other terms of each such Company Award, and
the plans or agreements under which they were issued, shall continue to apply in
accordance with their terms.

               (c)  The Company and Parent agree that the Company Stock Plans
and Parent equity-based incentive plans shall be amended, to the extent
necessary, to reflect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, but not limited to the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock
held or to be awarded or paid pursuant to such benefit plans, programs or
arrangements into shares of Parent Common Stock on a basis consistent with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. After the Effective Time, Parent
shall promptly issue new agreements reflecting each holder's Adjusted Options,
Adjusted Warrants or adjusted Company Awards.

               (d)  Parent shall (i) reserve for issuance the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock that will become subject to the benefit plans, programs
and arrangements referred to in this Section 5.6 and (ii) issue or cause to be
issued the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
applicable plans, programs and arrangements, upon the exercise or maturation of
rights existing thereunder on the Effective Time or thereafter granted or

appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
necessary to fulfill Parent's obligations under this Section 5.6.

                                      52

the prospectus required thereby shall be maintained) for at least as long as
Adjusted Options, Adjusted Warrants or adjusted Company Awards remain
outstanding.

               (e)  Parent and the Company shall each approve the conversion of
the outstanding Company Stock Options, Company Warrants and Company Awards

exemptions provided by Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act.

               (f)  The Company shall take all actions necessary to effect, as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the termination of the ESPP and of

occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current
or former directors or officers of the Company and its subsidiaries as provided
in their respective certificates of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) and any indemnification agreements or arrangements of
the Company and its subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective
Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such
individuals.

               (b)  In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and
is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation will assume the obligations thereof set forth in this Section 5.7.

               (c)  The provisions of this Section 5.7 (i) are intended to be
for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise.

               (d)  For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain in effect the Company's current directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently covered by the
Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on terms with
respect to such coverage and amount no less favorable to the Company's directors
and officers currently covered by such insurance than those of such policy in
effect on the date hereof; provided, that the Surviving Corporation may
                           --------
substitute therefor policies of Parent or its subsidiaries containing terms with
respect to coverage and amount no less favorable to such

                                      53

directors or officers; provided, further, that in no event shall the Surviving
                       --------  -------
Corporation be required to pay aggregate premiums for insurance under this
Section 5.7(d) in excess of 200% of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company
in 2000 on an annualized basis for such purpose and, if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may obtain
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering all acts or omissions
prior to the Effective Time at a cost not to exceed 125% of the cost of the
current directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by the Company.

               (e)  Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any
successor thereto to comply with its obligations under this Section 5.7.

     Agreement and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or
     the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) and (B) prior to the date that is

     Agreement is entered into, pay Parent a fee equal to $32,000,000 by wire
     transfer of same day funds.

                    (iii) In the event that (A) a Pre-Termination Takeover
     Proposal Event shall occur after the date of this Agreement, (B) this
     Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
     7.1(b)(ii), (C) the Average Trading Price shall not be below $6.00 per

     after the date such Company Acquisition Agreement is entered into, pay
     Parent a fee equal to $32,000,000 by wire transfer of the same day funds.

                    (iv)  In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the
     Company pursuant to Section 7.1(d), then concurrently with such
     termination, the

                                      54

     Company shall pay to Parent a fee equal to $32,000,000 by wire transfer of
     same day funds.

                    (v)   In the event that (A) a Pre-Termination Takeover
     Proposal Event shall occur after the date of this Agreement, (B) the
     Company Board of Directors has effected a Change in the Company
     Recommendation, and (C) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or
     Company for any reason provided for under Section 7.1, then, promptly, but
     in no event later than two business days after such termination, the
     Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to $32,000,000 by wire transfer of
     same day funds.

                    (vi)  For purposes of this Section 5.8(b), a "Pre-
     Termination Takeover Proposal Event" shall be deemed to occur if a Company
     Takeover Proposal shall have been made known to the Company or any of its
     subsidiaries or has been made directly to its stockholders generally or any
     person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not
     conditional) to make a Company Takeover Proposal. The Company acknowledges
     that the agreements contained in this Section 5.8(b) are an integral part
     of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
     agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the
     Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section
     5.8(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which
     results in a judgment against the Company for the fee set forth in this
     Section 5.8(b), the Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses
     (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
     together with interest on the amount of the fee at the rate on six-month
     U.S. Treasury obligations plus 300 basis points in effect on the date such
     payment was required to be made.

               (c)  The Company shall in no event be required to pay more than
one fee pursuant to Section 5.8(b). In the event that an amount is payable by
the Company pursuant to this Section 5.8, then, not withstanding anything in
this Agreement or the Voting Agreement to the contrary, (i) such amount shall be
full compensation and liquidated damages for the loss suffered by Parent as a
result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement to be consummated and to avoid the difficulty of determining
the damages under the circumstances and (ii) such amount shall be in lieu of any
other entitlement of Parent, and shall be the sole and exclusive liability of
the Company and the Company's stockholders, with respect to all matters arising
under or relating to this Agreement and the Voting Agreement, unless there has
been a willful or material breach of this Agreement or the Voting Agreement by
the Company or a stockholder of the Company, respectively.

Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) and the

                       -------------
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict of
laws thereof.

          SECTION 8.8  Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
                       ----------
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the
prior written consent of the other parties, provided, however, that Parent may
                                            --------  -------
assign Merger Sub's rights and obligations, in whole or in part, under this
Agreement to any other newly-formed subsidiary of Parent with no assets or
liabilities, which is wholly owned by Parent or by Parent's wholly-owned
subsidiary, as the case may be, in which event the assignee shall be considered
Merger Sub for purposes of this Agreement. Any assignment in violation of the
preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the

                                      66
<PAGE>

preceding two sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors
and assigns.

          SECTION 8.9  Consent to Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto
                       -----------------------
irrevocably agrees that any action, suit, claim or other legal proceeding with
respect to this Agreement or in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby
brought by any other party hereto or its successors or assigns shall be brought
and determined in any state or federal court located in the State of Delaware or
any appeals courts thereof (the "Delaware Courts"), and each of the parties
hereto irrevocably submits with regard to any such proceeding for itself and in
respect to its property, generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Delaware Courts. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim
or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the Delaware
Courts for any reason, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any Delaware Court or from any legal process commenced in any
Delaware Court (whether through service of notice, attachment before judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise)
and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, that (i) the
proceeding in any Delaware Court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by a Delaware Court. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that the other party shall have
the right to bring any action or proceeding for enforcement of a judgment
entered by the Delaware Courts in any other court or jurisdiction.

          SECTION 8.10 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement
                       --------
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

          SECTION 8.11 Severability. If any term or other provision of this
                       ------------
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

          SECTION 8.12 Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage
                       -----------
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
