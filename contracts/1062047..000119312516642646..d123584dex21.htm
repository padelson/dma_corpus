business and that are not individually or in the aggregate material.



   8.4 | To the extent legally permitted, the Sellers shall procure that

affect the business of any Group Company. The Sellers shall provide, and shall
cause the Group Companies to provide, to such representatives and advisers
such information as they may reasonably request for this purpose;

   8.5 | Nothing in this Clause 8 entitles the Purchaser or its
Representatives to have access prior to Closing to any information or
documentation in respect of the Group Companies or the Business which is
protected by legal professional privilege or litigation privilege unless that
documentation in the opinion of the Sellers can be disclosed without
prejudicing the rights to legal professional privilege or litigation privilege
or which would constitute a violation of the prohibition of a pre-execution
of a transaction ( _Vorvollzugsverbot_ ). 
---|--- 



   8.6 | After the Closing Conditions set forth in Clauses 9.2(a), (d) and
(e) have been satisfied, and the Purchaser shall have notified the Sellers

exist  under the condition that Purchaser continues to fulfil after Closing

   11. | Legal Consequences 
---|--- 

In case of breach of a Sellers Guarantee, the provisions set forth in
Clauses 11.1 to 11.10 shall apply.



   11.1 | Exhaustive Provisions 
---|--- 

Subject to mandatory law, in particular § 123 or § 276 para. 3 German Civil
Code ( _BGB_ ), other than with respect to claims arising from fraud,
intentional behaviour ( _Vorsatz_ ) and/or wilful misconduct ( _Arglist_ ) on
the part of a Party hereto in connection with the Transaction, the provisions
set forth in this Clause 11 shall be exhaustive and shall apply instead and to
the exclusion of any and all remedies available to the Purchaser under the law
in the event of defects in quality or title ( _Sach- oder Rechtsm angel_) of
the Group Companies. Any further liability of the Sellers and any differing or
further rights or claims of the Purchaser  including without limitation, the
right of rescission ( _Anfechtung_ ) or withdrawal ( _R ucktritt_)  arising
from or in connection with defects in quality or title, from incorrectness of
any of the guarantees or from the breach of any contractual or pre-contractual
obligation shall be excluded. Nothing in this Clause 11 shall limit any
persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any person is
entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any Partys fraudulent, criminal
or intentional misconduct.

 



76 ---|--- 

To the extent that the Sellers Guarantees are restricted to "Sellers best
Knowledge", this shall mean that none of the persons listed in _Schedule
11.2(a)_ has actual knowledge based on reasonable inquiries of the persons
listed in _Schedule 11.2(b)_.

 



   11.3 | Sellers Liability 
---|--- 



     | (a) | If any of the Sellers Guarantees is incorrect, if Sellers
breach any covenant, or if a claim arises from Sellers fraud (collectively,
"Breach"), the Sellers shall put the Purchaser or, or at the Purchasers sole
discretion, the respective Group Company in the position, in which the
Purchaser or the Group Company would be in, had the Sellers Guarantee been
correct, had Sellers not breached the covenant, or had Sellers not committed
fraud. The Purchaser shall first give the Sellers the opportunity to factually
remedy ( _Naturalrestitution_ ) the Breach within four weeks after being
required to do so by the Purchaser. If the Sellers are unable to achieve
this position within the four-weeks-period, the Sellers shall compensate the
Purchaser or, at the Purchasers sole discretion the respective Group Company
by way of monetary damages ( _Schadensersatz in Geld_ ) for all damages
suffered by the Purchaser or the respective Group Company as result of such
Breach. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The Sellers shall not be liable vis-a-vis the Purchaser in
case the Purchaser has at or before the Signing Date actual knowledge of a
breach of a Sellers Guarantee according to Clause 10. For purposes
of determining whether the Purchaser has knowledge of a breach of a Sellers
Guarantee, the Parties agree that the Purchaser has actual knowledge of all
documents disclosed in the Data Room prior to the Freeze Date as evidenced by
the Data Room CD-ROM, and in the event disclosures have been made orally or
otherwise not being on the CD-ROM, Sellers have the burden of proof that such
information has been properly disclosed to Purchaser. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Parties illustrate this understanding in two examples: 
---|---|--- 

Example 1: If a Sellers Guarantee is given by the Sellers in this
Agreement which is wrong but the underlying documentation is properly
disclosed in the Data Room prior to the Freeze Date so Purchaser has or could
have known that the Sellers Guarantee was wrong before or at the Signing
Date, there is no Breach of Sellers Guarantee. In the event the Parties are
in dispute whether a proper disclosure of the underlaying facts in the Data
Room has taken place, the procedure in Clauses 11 and 15 (4) shall apply.

 



77 Example 2: If a Sellers Guarantee is given by the Sellers in this Agreement
which is wrong and the underlying documentation is not or not properly
disclosed in the Data Room prior to the Freeze Date as evidenced on the Data
Room CD-ROM, there is a Breach of Sellers Guarantee, except Sellers  who
have the burden of proof- can evidence that the facts which have triggered
the Breach of Sellers Guarantee have been otherwise properly disclosed before
or at the Signing Date to Purchaser. In the event the Parties cannot agree
whether the underlying facts of a Breach of Sellers Guarantee have otherwise
been properly disclosed to Purchaser and/or the amount of the damage, the
procedure in Clauses 11 and 15 (4) shall apply.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, this Clause 11.3(b) applies only to Sellers
Guarantees and does not apply to any specific indemnities or other
guarantees.



     | (c) | The freeze date of the Data Room shall be 20 June 2016
(19:00 CET) (the "Freeze Date"). A CD-ROM with a copy of the Data Room content
burned by the data room provider at the Freeze Date shall be attached as
_Schedule 11.3(c)_ to this Agreement and shall serve as evidence for the
parties of the disclosed items. Sellers guarantee that the CD-ROM accurately
reflects the contents of the Data Room as of the Freeze Date, and that
all documents in the Data Room (as replicated on the CD-ROM) were accessible
and readable. 
---|---|--- 



   11.4 | De minimis, Basket, Cap 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Claims pursuant to this Clause 11 (other than Fundamental
Guarantee Claims and indemnity Claims pursuant to Clauses 11.11 to 11.18) can

     | (i) | a single claim exceeds an amount of EUR 15,000.00 ("de
minimis") and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the aggregate amount of the claims exceeds EUR 750,000.00
("basket"). 
---|---|---

amount in excess of the thresholds.



     | (b) | The Sellers liability under this Clause 11 shall be limited
to a maximum amount of 25% of the Purchase Price ("Cap") (which applies also
to Claims pursuant to Clauses 11.11 to 11.18), except for claims for a Breach
of a Fundamental Guarantee, a Breach of a covenant, arising from fraud, each
of which shall be limited to the Purchase Price. 
---|---|--- 
 



78 ---|--- 

The claims of the Purchaser under this Clause 11 shall become time-barred
as follows:



     | (a) | Claims arising from a Breach of Clauses 10.1 to 10.3 shall
become time barred 5 (in words: five) years after the Closing Date; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | All claims arising from any other Breach (not including a
breach of Clauses 11.11 to 11.18, 13.5 or 14) shall become time-barred 18
months after the Closing Date. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | § 203 German Civil Code ( _BGB_ ) shall not apply.

a Claim under or in connection with any Transaction Document (other than a
Third Party Claim), then:

after Purchaser has become aware of the matter in which the Claim is based
with as much detail of matter as is known to the Purchaser at that time;  
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Within 90 days following notification under Clause 11.6(a),
Purchaser will give a further notice that must contain: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | full details of the matter that gives or may give rise to
the Claim as known to Purchaser; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | if it is alleged that the matter referred to in Clause
11.6(a) constitutes a breach of this Agreement, the basis for that allegation;
and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | if reasonably practicable, an estimate of the amount of
the loss, if any, arising out of the Claim or the matter that gives or may
give rise to the Claim; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | Purchaser must provide any documentation and information in
relation to the Claim to Sellers; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

the failure to give notice in accordance with this Clause 11.6(a) and Clause
11.6(b) shall not relieve Sellers or their obligations in respect of a Claim,
except and only to 

---|---|--- 
 



79 reason of such failure in respect of a Claim or the amount of the Claim is
increased. 
---|--- 
 



   11.7 | Third Party Claims 
---|--- 

If the matter that gives or may give rise to a Claim under or in
connection with any Transaction Document arises in connection with a Claim by
a third party or a Liability to a third party ("Third Party Claim") then:



     | (a) | Purchaser must notify Sellers of the Third Party Claim
within 20 Business Days of Purchaser becoming aware of the existence of the
Third Party Claim, but the failure to give notice in accordance with this
Clause 11.7 shall not relieve Sellers of their obligations in respect of a
Claim, except and only to the extent that (i) Sellers forfeit rights or
defences by reason of such failure or (ii) the amount of the Claim is
increased; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | at the option, direction and expense of Sellers, Purchaser
must either: 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | take such action (including legal proceedings or making
claims under any insurance policies) as Sellers may reasonably require to
avoid, dispute, resist, defend, appeal, compromise or mitigate the Third Party
Claim; provided, that Purchaser receives prior approval from Sellers and does
all things reasonably requested by Sellers in respect of any actions relating
to the Third Party Claim. Sellers shall have the right to participate in the
defence of any Third Party Claim at Sellers expense and by the Sellers own
counsel; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | allow Sellers to take over the conduct of the Third Party
Claim and the Purchaser: 
---|---|--- 



     | (A) | must co-operate with Sellers and do all things reasonably
requested by Sellers in respect of the Third Party Claim; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (B) | agrees that Sellers may take such action as it may
reasonably determine regarding the Third Party Claim, including negotiating,
defending, settling, compromising and appealing the Third Party Claim in close
co-operation with Purchaser taking into account any supplier and/or customer
relationship of the Group Companies; 
---|---|--- 
 



80 right to defend any such Third Party Claim that (a) is asserted directly by or
on behalf of a person that is a supplier or customer of any Group Company,
or (b) seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against Purchaser, and
such Claims shall be addressed consistent with Clause 11.7(b)(i). 
---|---|--- 



   11.8 | If the Purchaser makes a payment or suffers a Loss in respect of
which the Purchaser is entitled to be indemnified or otherwise compensated by
the Sellers under this Agreement and payment so made by the
Sellers ("Payment") is subject to Tax in the hands of the Purchaser or a
withholding on account of Tax, the Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser such
additional amount as ensures that the Purchaser is left with the same amount
as it would have been entitled to receive in the absence of any such Tax
liability or withholding, provided that the Sellers shall not be under any
obligation to make an increased payment under this Clause 11.8 to the extent
the payment or Loss is deductible in computing the Purchasers tax liability
in respect of the Payment or no Tax would become payable if Sellers would
instead compensate the respective Group Company. 
---|--- 
 



   11.9 | Any additional payment due by the Sellers to the Purchaser under
Clause 11.8 shall be payable by the Sellers on the later of:

respect thereof by the Purchaser 
---|---|--- 



   11.10 | For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers will always compensate
the Purchaser or the Group Company for the amount of damage plus cost actually
occurred. However, Sellers will not make any payments based on an
adjustment of the Purchase Price i.e. taking into consideration any EBIT
multiples or alike.

I due to the fact that based on the existence of a valid fiscal income unity

against Seller I, or (ii) the increase of the income results in a reduction of
a loss or loss carry forward at the level of Seller I and (iii) the increase

   15.5 | Form of Amendments / Waivers 
---|--- 

Any amendment or supplement to or modification or termination of this
Agreement, including this provision, shall be valid only if made in writing (
_Textform_ ), except where a stricter form (e.g. notarisation) is required
under applicable law. Any waiver, permit, consent and approval under this
Agreement must be made expressly and in writing ( _Textform_ ). A waiver is
effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which
it is given. A single or partial exercise of a right by a Party does not
preclude another or further exercise or attempted exercise of that right or
the exercise of another right. Failure by a Party to exercise or delay in
exercising a right does not prevent its exercise or operate as a waiver.

provision shall, to the extent permitted by law, be deemed replaced by such
valid, effective and enforceable provision as comes closest to the economic
intent and purpose of such invalid, ineffective or unenforceable provision.
The aforesaid shall apply mutatis mutandis to any gap in this Agreement.
