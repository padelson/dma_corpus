                           CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

         Section 2.1  Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time, by
                      ---------------------------
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any
shares of the common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Company
Common Stock"), or common stock of Merger Sub:

                (a)   Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding
share of common stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

                (b)   Cancellation of Treasury Stock. All shares of Company
Common Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by the Company as treasury
stock shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no stock of
Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

                (c)   Exchange Ratio for Company Common Stock. Subject to
Section 2.2, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock (other
than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting
Shares (as defined in Section 2.3 hereof)) shall be converted into the right to
receive a fraction of a fully paid and non-assessable share of Parent's common
stock, $1.00 par value per share ("Parent Common Stock"), such fraction to be in
the ratio (the "Exchange Ratio") as set forth in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of
the immediately following sentence. If the Average Stock Price (as hereinafter
defined) is:

                      (i)    greater than $42.00, the Exchange Ratio shall be
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) $17.85 by (B) the Average Stock
Price;

                      (ii)   equal to or greater than $34.00 but less than or
equal to $42.00, the Exchange Ratio shall be .425;

                      (iii)  equal to or greater than $31.00 but less than
$34.00, the Exchange Ratio shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
(A) $14.45 by (B) the Average Stock Price; or

                      (iv)   less than $31.00, the Exchange Ratio shall be
 .466129 (provided that, in accordance with Section 7.1(c) hereof, the Company
may have the right to terminate this Agreement if the Average Stock Price is
less than $31.00).

                                       3
<PAGE>

         "Average Stock Price" means the average of the daily closing prices
during the regular session of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange
for the ten consecutive trading days ending on the fifth trading day immediately
prior to the Closing Date.


All such shares of Company Common Stock when so converted shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares
of Parent Common Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender
of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.

                (d)   Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time.

         Section 2.2  Exchange of Certificates. The procedures for exchanging
                      ------------------------
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for Parent Common Stock pursuant to
the Merger are as follows:

                (a)   Exchange Agent. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with a bank or trust company designated by Parent (the "Exchange
Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock for
exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2, through the Exchange Agent, (i)
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock (such shares of
Parent Common Stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares and any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to
as the "Exchange Fund") issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) cash, as required, in an
amount sufficient to make payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any,
required pursuant to Section 2.2(e).

                (b)   Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent and the Exchange Agent shall mail to
each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(the "Certificates") whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted
pursuant to Section 2.1 into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock (plus cash
in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of Parent Common Stock as provided below).
Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such
letter of

                                       4
<PAGE>

transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2 after taking into account all the
shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder under all such
Certificates so surrendered, and the Certificate so transferred shall
immediately be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a
certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may
be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common
Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the certificate
representing shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by this Section 2.2.

                (c)   Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled until the holder
of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the
effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate there
shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares
of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the
time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional
share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
subsection (e) below and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock after the Effective Time but prior to surrender
and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock.

                (d)   No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All
shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid
pursuant to subsection (c) or (e) of this Section 2.2) shall be deemed to have
been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation
to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to
the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by the Company on such
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
(to the extent permitted under Section 5.1) prior to the Effective Time and
which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and from and after the Effective Time
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.2.

                                       5
<PAGE>

                (e)   No Fractional Shares. No certificate or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle
the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of
Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in
lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part
of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Average Stock Price.

                (f)   Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the stockholders of the Company for six
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any stockholders of the Company who have not previously complied with this
Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for
Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company nine months
after the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental
entity) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of
the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claim or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

                (g)   No Liability. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
neither Parent nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

                (h)   Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options or Warrants
(as such terms are defined in Section 2.4 hereof) such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options or Warrants in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be.

                (i)   Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate,
the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange

                                       6
<PAGE>

for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, and unpaid dividends and
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.

"Company Stock Options") issued pursuant to the Company's 1996 Stock Option and
Grant Plan or the Company's 1996 Directors Stock Option Plan (collectively the
"Company Plans") or otherwise, shall be canceled and in exchange therefor,
Parent shall pay to the holder thereof a cash payment per Company Stock Option,
without interest, determined by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the
product of the Average Stock Price multiplied by the Exchange Ratio over the
applicable per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option by (ii) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, less applicable withholding tax. The

warrant that entitles the holder to purchase a share of Company Common Stock (a
"Warrant" or collectively "Warrants"), shall be converted into and shall become
the right to receive a cash payment per Warrant, without interest, determined by
multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the product of the Average Stock Price
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio over the applicable per share exercise price of
such Warrant by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying
such Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, all
outstanding Warrants shall be canceled and be of no further force or effect
except for the right to receive cash to the extent provided in this Section 2.4.

necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.4.

terminated as of the date hereof, (ii) each participant in the Stock Purchase
Plan on the date hereof shall be deemed to have exercised his or her Option (as
defined in the Stock Purchase Plan) on such date and shall acquire from the
Company (A) such number of whole shares of Company Common Stock as his or her
accumulated payroll deductions on such date will purchase at the Option Price
(as defined in the Stock Purchase Plan) (treating the last business day prior to
the date hereof as the "Exercise Date" for all purposes of the Stock Purchase
Plan) and (B) cash in the amount of any remaining balance in such participant's
account, and (iii) the Stock Purchase Plan shall be terminated effective as of

disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one
or more of such party's representations or warranties contained in Article 3 or
elsewhere in this Agreement:

         Section 3.1  Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.
                      --------------------------------------------

                (a)   The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its businesses as presently
conducted.

                (b)   Section 3.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule lists each
subsidiary of the Company and its jurisdiction of organization (each, a
"Subsidiary" and collectively, the "Subsidiaries"). The Company owns, directly
or indirectly, all of the outstanding capital stock (or other ownership
interests) of each of the Subsidiaries which, with respect to each such
Subsidiary, has been duly authorized and validly issued and is fully paid and
non assessable. Except as set forth

                                       9
<PAGE>

in Section 3.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company is the beneficial
owner of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary, free
and clear of any and all Liens (as hereinafter defined) and there are no
outstanding options, warrants, convertible securities, calls, rights,
commitments, preemptive rights or agreements or instruments or understandings of
any character, obligating any Subsidiary of the Company to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold, contingently or otherwise,
additional shares of capital stock of or other ownership interests in such
Subsidiary or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable for such

convertible security, call, right, commitment, preemptive right or agreement.
Except as set forth in Section 3.1(b) of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company
and the Subsidiaries have no investments (whether through acquisition of an
equity interest or otherwise) in any other person, joint venture, business,
corporation, partnership, trust or other entity with a fair market value in
excess of $250,000. For purposes of this Agreement, "Lien" means, with respect
to any asset (including, without limitation, any security) any mortgage, lien,
pledge, charge, claim, security interest or encumbrance of any kind in respect

                (c)   Each Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of
its incorporation or organization and has all requisite corporate or other power
and authority to own, lease and operate its respective properties and to carry
on its respective businesses as now being conducted, except where the failure to
be so organized, existing and in good standing or to have such power and
authority, both individually and in the aggregate, would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). For the purposes of this Agreement,
the term "Company Material Adverse Effect" means any change, effect, event,
occurrence, condition or development that is materially adverse to (i) the
business, assets, liabilities, properties, results of operations or condition

agreements, trusts, proxies, other agreements or understandings with respect to
which the Company or any material Subsidiary is not a party.

                (e)   Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified
or licensed to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
the property owned, leased or operated by it, or the nature of the business
conducted by it, makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good
standing would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

                (f)   The Company has previously made available to Parent true
and complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws of the
Company and the charter and by-laws of each of the Subsidiaries, and any similar

all as currently in full force and effect. The Constituent Documents of the
Subsidiaries do not contain any provision limiting or otherwise restricting the
ability of the Company to control such Subsidiaries.

intended to be qualified and tax-exempt under the provisions of Code Sections
401(a) and 501(a) has received a determination letter from the IRS that it is so

the knowledge of the Company, any trustee or administrator of any Plan, has
engaged in a "prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 4975 of the Code,
or a transaction prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA that could give rise to any

former employees of the Company or any Subsidiary and which is a "group health
plan," as defined in Section 607(l) of ERISA, has been operated in compliance in
all material respects with the provisions of Part 6 of Title I, Subtitle B of

employees of any Subsidiary organized under the laws of or doing business in any
country other than the United States which if maintained or administered in or
otherwise subject to the laws of the United States would be an "employee pension
benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA (except for any such plan
providing for benefits which are required pursuant to any foreign law or
regulation), to the knowledge of the Company, each such plan has been maintained
in all material respects in compliance with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by any and all applicable statutes, orders, rules and regulations
(including without limitation any special provisions relating to the tax status
of contributions to, earnings of or distributions from such plans where each
such plan was intended to have such tax status) and has been maintained in good
standing with applicable regulatory authorities.

                (h)   The representations and warranties set forth in Section
3.11(d) are also true with respect to any employee pension benefit plan (as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) maintained, sponsored, administered or
contributed to by any entity which is in the same "controlled group" (as defined
in Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA or Section 412(l)(8)(c) of the Code) as the
Company or any Subsidiary.

subsequent to the Effective Time, except as would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

liability under any such policy. All material claims under the Insurance
Policies have been filed in a timely fashion.

Bylaws, as currently in effect, of Parent and Merger Sub. Each of Parent and its
subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business
in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or
the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing

Adverse Effect. When used in connection with Parent or Merger Sub, the term
"Parent Material Adverse Effect" means any change, effect, event, occurrence,
condition or development that is materially adverse to (i) the business, assets,
liabilities, properties, results of operations or condition (financial or

of Parent or Merger Sub to perform their respective obligations under this
Agreement.

deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Merger. The execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger have been duly and validly
authorized by the boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub and by Parent as
the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and constitutes a valid, legal and
binding agreement of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of
Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except (i) to the extent
that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and (ii) that the availability of equitable remedies, including
specific performance, is subject to the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding thereof may be brought.

Sub of the Merger do not and will not (a) conflict with or result in any breach
of any provision of the respective Constituent Documents of Parent or Merger
Sub, (b) result in a violation or breach of, or cause acceleration, or

give rise to any right of termination, amendment, cancellation, acceleration or
loss of material benefits to Parent or Merger Sub) under, any of the terms,

contract, agreement or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or Merger

                       --------  -------
stockholders of the Company for approval of the Merger, if the Company receives
a Competing

                                      35
<PAGE>

Transaction that was unsolicited or that did not otherwise result from a breach
of this Section 5.2(a), and the Company Board determines in good faith that (i)
based on the advice of its Financial Advisor, such Competing Transaction is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Transaction (as defined below) and (ii)
based on the advice of its legal counsel, failing to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable
law, then the Company may (x) furnish information with respect to the Company to
such person pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement and (y)
participate in discussion or negotiations with such person regarding such
Superior Transaction. For purposes of this agreement, the term "Superior
Transaction" shall mean a Competing Transaction that (A) the Company Board
determines in good faith, based on the advice of its outside legal counsel and
its financial advisor, is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than

conditioned on obtaining financing (and with respect to which the Company has
received objective written evidence that demonstrates such third party's ability
to fully finance its Competing Transaction).

                (b)   Neither the Company (or any of the Subsidiaries) nor the

approval, adoption or recommendation by the Company Board or any such committee
of this Agreement or the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to
approve or recommend, any Competing Transaction, or (iii) approve or recommend,
or propose to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement or other agreement relating to any Competing Transaction or propose or
agree to do any of the foregoing; provided, however, that prior to the vote of
                                  --------  -------
the stockholders of the Company for approval of the Merger, the Company may, if
and so long as the Company Board determines in good faith by a majority vote,
based upon the advice of its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor,
that failing to take such action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Company Board under applicable law, and after compliance with the
following sentence, terminate this Agreement (provided that concurrently with
                                              --------
such termination the Company enters into a definitive agreement containing the
terms of a Superior Transaction). If the Company shall exercise its right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 5.2(b), the Company shall
deliver to Parent (i) by wire transfer of immediately available funds the
Termination Fee as provided in Section 7.3(b) and (ii) written acknowledgment
from the Company and from the other person to the Superior Transaction that the
Company and such other person have irrevocably waived any right to contest such
payment. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
may only exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
5.2(b) at a time that is after the fifth calendar day following Parent's and
Merger Sub's receipt of written notice advising Parent and Merger Sub that the
Company Board is prepared, subject to any action taken by Parent and Merger Sub
pursuant to this sentence, to cause the Company to accept a Competing
Transaction, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Competing
Transaction and identifying the person making such Competing Transaction (it
being understood and agreed that any material amendment or modification of a
Competing Transaction shall result in a new Competing Transaction for which a
new five calendar day period following a new notice referred to above shall be
required under this sentence).

<PAGE>

                (c)   The Company promptly (and in any event within 12 hours of
the relevant event) shall advise Parent and Merger Sub orally and in writing of
any Competing Transaction or any inquiry with respect to or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to any Competing Transaction and the identity of
the person making any such Competing Transaction or inquiry, and, in each case,
the terms and conditions thereof, including any material amendment or other
modification to the terms of any such Competing Transaction or inquiry.

                (d)   Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit the
Company from at any time taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or
making any disclosure required by Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

                (e)   The Company shall not cancel, terminate, amend, modify or
waive any of the terms of any confidentiality or standstill agreement executed
with respect to the Company by any other party prior to the date of this
Agreement.

                (f)   The Company agrees that it will promptly inform its
directors, officers, key employees, agents and representatives of its
obligations in this Section 5.2.

         Section 5.3  Access to Information.
                      ---------------------

                (a)   Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the
Company will (and will cause each Subsidiary to) provide to Parent and Merger
Sub and their authorized representatives access to all employees, plants,
offices, warehouses and other facilities and to all books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, will permit Parent and Merger Sub to make such
inspections as Parent and Merger Sub may reasonably require and will cause the
Company's officers and those of its Subsidiaries to furnish Parent and Merger
Sub with such financial and operating data and other information with respect to
the business, properties, contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other
aspects of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or Merger Sub may from
time to time reasonably request.

                (b)   Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and will cause its

         Section 5.5  Preparation of Registration Statement and Proxy Statement.

of the SEC (after consultation with Parent and Merger Sub) and to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders as promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement (as defined below) is declared
effective by the SEC. As soon as practicable following the Company's preparation
of the preliminary Proxy Statement, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC
the Registration Statement (after providing the Company with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon), in which the Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus, provided that Parent may delay the filing of the
Registration Statement until the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC. Buyer
and Seller shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement
to become effective as soon as practicable after such filing. The Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other, shall promptly notify the
other of the receipt of any comments from the SEC and of any request by the SEC
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or Registration Statement
or for additional information and shall supply the other with copies of all
correspondence between a party hereto or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or
Registration Statement. If at any time prior to the Stockholders' Meeting there
shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its
stockholders such an amendment or supplement; provided, that no such amendment
                                              --------
or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company without
providing Parent and Merger Sub the reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon.

                  (b) The information to be supplied by the Company for
inclusion in the registration statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger will be registered under the Securities
Act (the "Registration Statement"), shall not at the time the Registration
Statement is filed with the SEC and at the time the Registration Statement is
declared effective by the SEC contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated in the Registration
Statement or necessary in order to make the statements in the Registration
Statement, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The information included or incorporated by reference in the proxy
statement/prospectus and any amendment thereto (except for information supplied
by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in such proxy statement/prospectus or
amendment, as to which the Company makes no representation) to be sent to the
stockholders of the Company in connection with the Stockholders Meeting (the
"Proxy Statement") shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first

                                      38

mailed to stockholders of the Company, at the time of the Stockholders Meeting
and at the Effective Time, contain any statement which, at such time and in
light of the circumstances under which it shall be made, is false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary
in order to make the statements made in the Proxy Statement not false or
misleading; or omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any
statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of
proxies for the Stockholders Meeting which has become false or misleading. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time any event relating to the Company or any of
its affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by the Company which
should be set forth in an amendment to the Registration Statement or a
supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly inform Parent. The
Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, except that no representation is made by the Company with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in writing specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

                (c)   The information in the Registration Statement (except for
information supplied by the Company for inclusion in the Registration Statement,
as to which Parent makes no representation) shall not at the time the
Registration Statement is filed with the SEC and at the time the Registration
Statement is declared effective by the SEC contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated in the
Registration Statement or necessary in order to make the statements in the
Registration Statement, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The information supplied by Parent for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to
stockholders of the Company, at the time of the Stockholders Meeting and at the
Effective Time, contain any statement which, at such time and in light of the
circumstances under which it shall be made, is false or misleading with respect
to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to
make the statements made in the Proxy Statement not false or misleading; or omit
to state any material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Stockholders
Meeting which has become false or misleading. If at any time prior to the
Effective Time any event relating to Parent or any of its affiliates, officers
or directors should be discovered by Parent which should be set forth in an
amendment the Registration Statement or a supplement to the Proxy Statement,
Parent shall promptly inform the Company. The Registration Statement will comply
as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except that no
representation is made by Parent with respect to statements made or incorporated
by reference therein based on information supplied by the Company in writing
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement.

                (d)   The Company represents that the Financial Advisor has,
subject to the terms of its engagement letter with the Company, consented to the
inclusion of its opinion in its entirety in the Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement.

         Section 5.6  Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings; Further Assurances.
                      ---------------------------------------------------------

                (a)   The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable federal, state, local or foreign Laws or otherwise to

(ii) obtain expeditiously from any Governmental Entities any consents, licenses,

and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this
Agreement and the Merger required under (A) the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act, and any other applicable federal or state securities Laws, (B) the HSR Act
and any related governmental request thereunder and (C) any other applicable
Law; provided, that Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate with each
     --------
other in connection with the making of all such filings, including providing
copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to
filing; provided further that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and
        -------- -------
Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section 5.6(a)
as "outside counsel only," which materials and information contained therein
shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not
be disclosed by such outside counsel to directors, officers or employees of the
recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of
the materials (the Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.
From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each party shall
promptly notify the other party in writing of any pending or, to the knowledge
of the first party, threatened action, proceeding or investigation by any
Governmental Entity or any other person (i) challenging or seeking material
damages in connection with the Merger or the conversion of shares of Company
Common Stock into Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares
thereof pursuant to the Merger or (ii) seeking to restrain or prohibit the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise limit the
right of Surviving Corporation to own or operate all or any portion of the
businesses or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

                (b)   The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish to each
other all information required for any application or other filing to be made
pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable Law (including all
information required to be included in the Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

                (c)   Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall give (or
shall cause its respective subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties
and use, and cause its respective subsidiaries to use, their reasonable efforts
to obtain any third party consents, (A) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the Merger, (B) disclosed or required to be disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedule or (C) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect
from occurring. In the event that Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall fail
to obtain any third party consent described in the previous sentence, it shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take any such

                                      40
<PAGE>

actions reasonably requested by the other party, to minimize any adverse effect
upon the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, their respective subsidiaries, and
their respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to
result after the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent.

                (d)   If any state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation becomes applicable to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will take all action necessary to
ensure that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such statute or regulation on the Merger.

                (e)   If at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
including the execution of additional documents, the proper officers and
directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all such necessary action.
At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf
of the Company, any other actions to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in,
to and under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or
to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger.

         Section 5.7  Public Announcements. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
                      --------------------
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Merger. Prior
to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the
other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), except as may be
required by Law or any listing agreement with the NASD (as defined in Section
5.10) or any national securities exchange to which Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company is a party and, in such case, shall use reasonable efforts to consult
with all the parties hereto prior to such release or statement being issued.
Each of Parent and the Company shall be entitled to review and comment upon the
text of the press release by which the other party will announce the execution
of this Agreement.

         Section 5.8  Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.
                      ---------------------------------------------------

                (a)   In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action,
suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit,
demand, proceeding or investigation in which any person who is now, or has been
at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective
Time, a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a
party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee,
fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries as a director,
officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, or (ii) the negotiation, execution or

                                      41
<PAGE>

performance of this Agreement or the Merger, whether in any case asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to
cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond
thereto. It is understood and agreed that the Company shall indemnify and hold
harmless, and after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the full extent permitted by
applicable law, each Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation,
and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the
Effective Time), (A) the Company, and the Surviving Corporation and Parent after
the Effective Time, shall promptly pay expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified
Party to the full extent permitted by law, subject to the provision by such
Indemnified Party of an undertaking to reimburse the amounts so advanced in the
event that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to such amounts, (B) the
Indemnified Parties may, with the prior written consent of Parent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, retain one counsel, and the
Company, and the Surviving Corporation and Parent after the Effective Time,
shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Parties within 30 days after the statements therefor are received, and (C) the
Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of any such matter;
provided that none of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall be
--------
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and provided further that the
                                                 -------- -------
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party if the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 5.8, upon learning of any
such claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, shall notify the
Company and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent,
thereof; provided that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations
         --------
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation and Parent except to the extent such
failure to notify materially prejudices such party.

                (b)   Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to
indemnification existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal
liability of, the directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and
the Subsidiaries provided for in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws as in effect as of the date hereof with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Effective Time, and including the Merger, shall continue in full
force and effect for a period of not less then six years from the Effective
Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
      --------  -------
claims (each a "Claim") asserted or made within such period shall continue until
the disposition of such Claim. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under the Company's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage for the Company's
directors and officers in a form acceptable to the Company which shall provide
such directors and officers with coverage for six years following the Effective
Time of not less than the existing coverage under, and have other terms not
materially less favorable on the whole to, the insured persons than the
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage presently maintained by
the Company so long as the cost of the directors' and officers' liability
insurance is

                                      42
<PAGE>

less than $125,000 (the "Maximum Insurance Premium"); provided, however, that
                                                      --------  -------
the Company agrees to cooperate in good faith with Parent in order to obtain the
lowest premium for the above- referenced coverage. In the event that the Maximum
Insurance Premium is insufficient for the above-referenced coverage, the Company
may spend up to the amount of the Maximum Insurance Premium to purchase such
lesser coverage that may be obtained for the Maximum Insurance Premium.

                (c)   This Section 5.8 is intended for the benefit of, and to
grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation.
Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce the covenants
contained in this Section 5.8.

                (d)   In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors and assigns (i) is consolidated with or merges into
another person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any other person in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions, then in each such case Parent shall make or cause to be
made proper provision so that the successor or transferee of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.8.

         Section 5.9  Notification of Certain Matters. From and after the date
                      -------------------------------
of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto of:

                (a)   the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which would be reasonably likely to cause any
condition set forth on Article 6 hereof not to be satisfied.

                (b)   the failure of any party hereto to comply with or satisfy
in all material respects any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement;

                (c)   the receipt of any notice or other communication from any
person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required in
connection with the Merger, except for any such consents set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule or otherwise provided for in this Agreement;

                (d)   the receipt of any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger; and

                (e)   any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
commenced or, to the knowledge of the party, threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, which
relates to the consummation of the Merger;

                                      43
<PAGE>

in each case, to the extent such event or circumstance is or becomes known to
the party required to give such notice; provided, however, that the delivery of
                                        --------  -------
any notice pursuant to this Section 5.9 shall not be deemed to be an amendment
of this Agreement or any Section in the Disclosure Schedule and shall not cure
any breach of any representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter
prior to the date of this Agreement.

         Section 5.10 SEC Filings. Unless an exemption shall be expressly
                      -----------
applicable to the Company, or unless Parent or Merger Sub agrees otherwise in
writing, the Company will file with the SEC and the National Association of
Security Dealers ("NASD") all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the SEC and NASD (including, without limitation, all
required financial statements). Such reports and other information shall comply
in all material respects with all of the requirements of the SEC and NASD rules
and regulations, and when filed, will not include an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

         Section 5.11 Takeover Statutes. If any "fair price," "moratorium,"
                      -----------------
"control share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation
enacted under state or federal laws in the United States (each a "Takeover
Statute") is or may become applicable to the Merger, the Company will use
reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that the Merger may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act so as to eliminate or minimize
the effects of any Takeover Statute on the Merger.

         Section 5.12 Representations. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
                      ---------------
Sub (a) will use reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to render
true and correct as of the Closing its respective representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement, (b) will refrain from taking any action that would
render any such representation or warranty untrue or incorrect as of such time
and (c) will perform or cause to be satisfied each agreement, covenant or
condition to be performed or satisfied by it.

         Section 5.13 Employee Benefit Arrangements.

                (a)   Except as set forth in Section 5.13 of the Disclosure
Schedule, after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation (x) to
honor all obligations under (i) the existing terms of the employment, retention,
termination and severance agreements to which the Company or any Subsidiary is
presently a party and other compensation agreements, arrangements and plans of
the Company or any Subsidiary (including, without limitation, any management
incentive or incentive compensation plans) existing prior to the date of this
Agreement, except, in each case, as may otherwise be agreed to by the parties
thereto, and (ii) the Company's and any Subsidiary's general severance policy
and (y) to allow employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries to continue to
participate in the Plans (other than stock option or stock purchase plans) on
substantially similar terms to those currently in effect; provided that, in each
                                                          --------
case, Parent or Merger Sub may substitute its own arrangements, plans or

                                      44
<PAGE>

policies are either (A) not materially less favorable to the employees as those
of the Company currently in effect or (B) those arrangements, plans or policies
currently in effect for comparable employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

                (b)   If any employee of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
becomes a participant in any employee benefit plan, practice or policy of
Parent, any of its affiliates or the Surviving Corporation, such employee shall
be given credit under such plan for all service prior to the Effective Time with
the Company and the Subsidiaries and prior to the time such employee becomes
such a participant, for purposes of eligibility (including, without limitation,
waiting periods) and vesting, and such employees will be given credit for such
service for purposes of any vacation policy. In addition, if any employees of
the Company or any of the Subsidiaries employed as of the Closing Date become
covered by a medical plan of Parent, any of its affiliates or the Surviving
Corporation, such medical plan shall not impose any exclusion on coverage for
preexisting medical conditions with respect to these employees. Such employees
shall also be given credit for any deductible or co-payment amounts paid in
respect of the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs to the extent that,
following the Closing Date, they participate in any plan of Parent, any of its
affiliates or the Surviving Corporation for which deductibles or co-payments are
requested. Parent and the Surviving Corporation will make appropriate
arrangements with its insurance carrier(s) to ensure the foregoing.

         Section 5.14 Tax-Free Reorganization. The Company, on the one hand, and
                      -----------------------
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall execute and deliver to tax
counsel to Parent and Merger Sub and to tax counsel to the Company certificates
in customary form as are reasonably requested by such tax counsel in connection
with the delivery by such tax counsel of the opinions described in Sections
6.2(f) and 6.3(b) hereof. Except as otherwise required by law, each of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving Corporation, agrees to file its tax
returns in a manner that is consistent with the Merger qualifying as a tax-free
reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(E) of
the Code. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
knowingly shall take or cause to be taken any action that, or knowingly shall
fail to take or cause not to be taken any action the failure of which,
reasonably would be expected to affect adversely the qualification of the Merger
as a tax-free reorganization under Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(E) of the
Code. Each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a tax-
free reorganization under Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code.

         Section 5.15 Nasdaq Quotation. The Company agrees to use its commercial
                      ----------------

National Market during the term of this Agreement.

         Section 5.16 New York Stock Exchange. Parent shall use its commercial
                      -----------------------
best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice
of issuance, on or prior to the Closing Date.

                (a)   Stockholder Approval. This Agreement shall have been
approved and adopted by the affirmative vote of the stockholders of the Company
(unless the vote of the stockholders is not required by the DGCL) as required
under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws and the DGCL.

                (b)   No Order. No foreign, United States or state governmental
authority or other agency or commission or foreign, United States or state court
of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or
entered any law, statute, rule, regulation, executive order, stay, decree,
injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which is
then in effect (which order or other action the parties hereto shall use their
best efforts to vacate or lift) and has the effect of making the consummation of
the Merger illegal under applicable law or otherwise prohibiting consummation of
the Merger or materially limiting or restricting the Surviving Corporation's or
Merger Sub's conduct or operation of the business of the Company after the
Merger; provided that the party seeking to rely upon this condition has fully
complied with and performed its obligations pursuant to Section 5.6 hereof.

extension thereof) applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act shall have

have become effective in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act,
and no stop order suspending such effectiveness shall have been issued and
remain in effect, and no proceedings for such purpose, or under the proxy rules

         Section 8.4  Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
                      ----------------------------------------------------------
Agreement. Except for Sections 2.2, 2.6, 5.3(b), 5.6(e), 5.7, 5.8, 5.13, 5.14
---------
and 7.3 and Article 8, none of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant
to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time, and thereafter there shall
be no liability on the part of either Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any
of their respective officers, directors or stockholders in respect thereof.
Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, there are no representations or
warranties of any party hereto, express or implied.

         Section 8.5  Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
                      -------------
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to
the principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole
and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and of the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the "Delaware
Courts") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the Merger (and
agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts),
waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the
Delaware Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such
litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of
the parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject
to service of process in the State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain an agent
in the State of Delaware as such party's agent for acceptance of legal process,
and (b) that service of process may also be made on such party by prepaid
certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States
Postal Service constituting evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to
(a) or (b) above shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon
such party personally within the State of Delaware. For purposes of implementing
the parties' agreement to appoint and maintain an agent for service of process
in the State of Delaware, each such party does hereby appoint CT Corporation,
Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, DE 19801, as such
agent.

         Section 8.6  Construction; Interpretation. The headings contained in
                      ----------------------------
this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way
the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. By means of amplification and
not limitation, the fact that a representation or warranty of a party is not set
forth in a section with an appropriate heading shall not affect its construction
as a representation or warranty. Article, section, exhibit, schedule, annex,
party, preamble and recital references are to this Agreement unless otherwise
stated. No party, nor its respective counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of
this Agreement for purposes of construing the provisions hereof, and all
provisions of this Agreement shall be construed according to their fair meaning
and not strictly for or against any party. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to subsidiaries of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, the word
"subsidiary" means any corporation more than 50% of whose outstanding voting
securities, or any partnership, joint venture or other entity more than 50% of
whose total equity interest, is directly or indirectly owned by Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company, as the case may be.

         Section 8.7  Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon
                      -------------------
and inure solely to the benefit of each party and its successors and permitted
assigns and nothing in this Agreement,

                                      53
<PAGE>

express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sections 5.8 and 5.13 are intended to
be for the benefit of those persons described therein and the covenants
contained therein may be enforced by such persons.


         Section 8.8  Severability. If any term or other provision of this
                      ------------
Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all other provisions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party.

         Section 8.9  Specific Performance. The parties acknowledge that
                      --------------------
irreparable damage would result if this Agreement were not specifically enforce,
and they therefore consent that the rights and obligations of the parties under
this Agreement may be enforced by a decree of specific performance issued by a
court of competent jurisdiction. Such remedy shall, however, not be exclusive
and shall be in addition to any other remedies, including arbitration, which any
party may have under this Agreement or otherwise.

         Section 8.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or
                      ------------
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which shall constitute one and the same agreement.

         Section 8.11 No Agreement Until Executed. Irrespective of negotiations
                      ---------------------------
among the parties or the exchanging of drafts of this Agreement, this Agreement
shall not constitute or be deemed to evidence a contract, agreement, arrangement
or understanding among the parties hereto unless this Agreement is executed by
the parties hereto.

                                      54
<PAGE>

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has caused this Agreement to be
duly executed on its behalf as of the day and year first above written.
