Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller shall prepare and submit to Buyer
for review a draft settlement statement (the " ** _Preliminary Settlement
Statement_** ") that shall set forth the Adjusted Purchase Price, reflecting
each adjustment made in accordance with this Agreement as of the date of
preparation of such Preliminary Settlement Statement and the itemized
calculation and reasonable supporting documentation of the adjustments used to

practicable, and in any event within 30 days after receipt of the Final
Settlement Statement, Buyer shall return to Seller a written report containing
any proposed changes to the Final Settlement Statement and an explanation of
any such changes and the reasons therefor (the " ** _Dispute Notice_** ").
Buyers failure to deliver to Seller a Dispute Notice detailing proposed
changes to any of the adjustments in the Final Settlement Statement by such
date shall be deemed to be an acceptance by Buyer of the adjustments set forth
in the Final Settlement Statement delivered by Seller and any further changes
to any of the adjustments set forth in the Final Settlement Statement shall be
deemed waived by Buyer, and Sellers determinations with respect to all such
adjustments in the Final Settlement Statement shall prevail. If Buyer does
deliver a Dispute Notice then, except for the adjustment changes raised by
Buyer in such Dispute Notice, all other changes to any of the adjustments set
forth in the Final Settlement Statement shall be deemed waived by Buyer, and
Sellers determinations with respect to all such adjustments in the Final
Settlement Statement shall prevail. If the final Purchase Price less the
Defect Cure Escrow Amounts set forth in the Final Settlement Statement is
mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer or deemed agreed pursuant to the
foregoing (or determined by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant to _Section
3.7_), the Final Settlement Statement and such final Adjusted Purchase Price,
less the Defect Cure Escrow Amounts (the " ** _Final Price_** "), shall be
final and binding on the Parties. Any difference in the Adjusted Purchase
Price (less the Defect Cure Escrow Amounts) as paid at Closing pursuant to the
Preliminary Settlement Statement and the Final Price shall be paid by the
owing Party (which, if due by Buyer, SN shall notify Seller in writing of the
amount of such difference owed by each Buyer Party based on such Buyer Partys
Proportionate Share and the portion of the Assets acquired by such Buyer
Party), and on or before the date that is 10 days following agreement or
deemed agreement (or determination by the Accounting Arbitrator, as
applicable) (such date, the " ** _Final Payment Date_** ") to the owed Party
(which, if owed to Buyer, SN shall notify Seller in writing of the amount of
such difference to be paid to each Buyer Party based on such Buyer Partys
Proportionate Share and the portion of the Assets acquired by such Buyer
Party). In addition, on or before the Final Payment Date, Seller shall
transfer to Buyer all Suspense Funds. All amounts paid or transferred pursuant
to this _Section 3.6_ shall be delivered in United States currency by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified in writing by
the relevant Party.

 



 

 ** _3.7_** **_Disputes_** ** _._** If Seller and Buyer are unable to resolve
the matters addressed in the Dispute Notice, each of Buyer and Seller shall
within 14 Business Days after the delivery of such Dispute Notice, summarize
its position with regard to such dispute in a written document of twenty pages
or less and submit such summaries to the Houston, Texas office of Grant
Thornton LLP or such other Person as the Parties may mutually select (provided
that if Grant Thornton LLP refuses to serve as Accounting Arbitrator and the
Parties are unable to mutually agree upon

 



      
 

 



 

an alternative Accounting Arbitrator, then the Houston office of the AAA shall
choose such Accounting Arbitrator (Grant Thornton LLP or such other Person
agreed to by the Parties or chosen by the AAA, the " ** _Accounting
Arbitrator_** "), together with the Dispute Notice, the Final Settlement
Statement and any other documentation such Party may desire to submit. Within
20 Business Days after receiving the Parties respective submissions, the
Accounting Arbitrator shall render a decision choosing either Sellers
position or Buyers position with respect to each matter addressed in any
Dispute Notice, based on the materials described above. Any decision rendered
by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and
binding on Seller and Buyer and will be enforceable against any of the Parties
in any court of competent jurisdiction. The costs of such Accounting
Arbitrators shall be borne one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller.

 



 

 ** _3.8_** **_Allocation of Purchase Price / Allocated Values_** ** _._**
Buyer and Seller agree that the unadjusted Purchase Price shall be allocated
among the Assets as set forth in _Exhibit A-1 _and _Exhibit A-2_, as
applicable. The " ** _Allocated Value_** " for any Asset equals the portion of
the unadjusted Purchase Price allocated to such Asset in _Exhibit A-1_ or
_Exhibit A-2_, as applicable, and such Allocated Value shall be used in
calculating adjustments to the Purchase Price as provided herein. Buyer and
Seller also agree (a) that the Allocated Values, as adjusted, shall be used by
Seller and Buyer as the basis for reporting asset values and other items for
purposes of this _Section 3.8_, and (b) that neither they nor their
Affiliates will take positions inconsistent with such Allocated Values in
notices to Governmental Authorities, in notices to Preferential Purchase Right
holders or in other documents or notices relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 ** _3.9_** **_Tax Allocation_** ** _._** Seller and Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to agree to an allocation of the Purchase
Price and any other items properly treated as consideration for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes among the Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and, to the extent allowed by applicable Law, in a manner consistent with
the Allocated Values, within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Final
Settlement Statement pursuant to Section 3.6. If the Parties reach an
agreement with respect to such allocation (as agreed, the " ** _Tax
Allocation_** "), (i) the Parties shall update the Tax Allocation in a manner
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code following any adjustment to the
Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) Seller and Buyer shall,
and shall cause their Affiliates to, report consistently with the Tax
Allocation on all Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594
(Asset Acquisition Statement under Section 1060), which Form will be timely
filed, if applicable, separately by Seller and Buyer with the Internal Revenue
Service pursuant to the requirements of Section 1060(b) of the Code), and
neither Seller nor Buyer shall take any position in any Tax Return that is
inconsistent with the Tax Allocation unless otherwise required by applicable
Law; provided, however, that neither Party shall be unreasonably impeded in
its ability and discretion to negotiate, compromise and/or settle any Tax
audit, claim or similar proceedings in connection with such allocation.

seek specific performance of each Buyer Partys obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded or to cause the Buyer Parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including to effect the Closing

asserted and resolved as follows:

 



 

(a) For purposes of this _Article VIII, __Section 11.7(c)_, _Section
12.1(c)_ and _Section 13.4(c)_, the term " ** _Indemnifying Party_** " when
used in connection with particular Liabilities shall mean the Party or Parties

(b) To make a claim under _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_, _Section 8.4_,
_Section 8.5_, _Section 11.7(c)_, _Section 12.1(c)_, or _Section 13.4(c)_,
an Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of its claim under
this _Section 8.9_ including the specific details of and specific basis under
this Agreement for its claim (the " ** _Claim Notice_** "). In the event that
the claim for indemnification is based upon a claim by a Third Party against
the Indemnified Party (a " ** _Claim_** "), the Indemnified Party shall
provide its Claim Notice promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual
knowledge of the Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served
with respect to the Claim; _provided_ that the failure of any Indemnified
Party to give notice of a Claim as provided in this _Section 8.9_ shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under _Section 8.2_,
_Section 8.3_, _Section 8.4_, _Section 8.5_, _Section 11.7(c)_, _Section
12.1(c)_ and _Section 13.4(c)_ (as applicable) except to the extent (and then
only to the extent) such failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying
Partys ability to defend against the Claim. In the event that the claim for
indemnification is based upon an inaccuracy or breach of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement, the Claim Notice shall specify the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that was inaccurate or
breached.

 



 

(c) In the case of a claim under _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_, _Section
8.4_, _Section 8.5_, _Section 11.7(c)_, _Section 12.1(c) _or _Section
13.4(c)_ (in each case) based upon a Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have
30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Party
whether it admits or denies its Indemnity Obligations, including to defend the
Indemnified Party against such Claim at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to and during
such 30 day period, to file any motion, answer or other pleading that it shall
deem necessary or appropriate to protect its interests or those of the
Indemnifying Party and that is not prejudicial to the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(d) If the Indemnifying Party admits its Indemnity Obligations, it shall have
the right and obligation to diligently defend, at its sole cost and expense,
the Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof unless the
compromise or settlement includes the payment of any amount by (because of the
Indemnity Deductible or otherwise), the performance of any obligation by or
the limitation of any right or benefit of, the Indemnified Party, in which
event

 



      
 

 



 

such settlement or compromise shall not be effective without the consent of
the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If
requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate
in contesting any Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The
Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
_Section 8.9(d)_. An Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written
consent of the Indemnified Party, (i) settle any Claim or consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect thereto which does not include an unconditional
written release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such
Claim or (ii) settle any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect thereto in any manner that may materially and adversely affect the
Indemnified Party (other than as a result of money damages covered by the
indemnity).

 



 

(e) If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its Indemnity Obligations (which
it will be deemed to have so done if it fails to timely respond) or admits its
Indemnity Obligations but fails to diligently prosecute or settle the Claim,
then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend against the Claim at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of the
Indemnified Partys choosing, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party
to admit its Indemnity Obligations and assume the defense of the Claim at any
time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If the Indemnifying
Party has not yet admitted its Indemnity Obligations for a Claim, then the
Indemnified Party shall send written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any
proposed settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option for 10
Business Days following receipt of such notice to (i) admit in writing its
Indemnity Obligations for the Claim and, if its Indemnity Obligations are so
admitted, reject, in its reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement, or (ii)
deny liability for such Claim; provided that if the Indemnifying Party does
not notify the Indemnified Party within such 10 Business Day period, then the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to be denying its liability for such Claim
and, in the event of a denial of liability for such Claim, then the
Indemnified Party may enter into such proposed settlement on the terms
disclosed to the Indemnifying Party without the Indemnifying Partys consent.

 



 

(f) In the case of a claim under _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_, _Section
8.4_, _Section 8.5_, _Section 11.7(c)_, _Section 12.1(c) _or _Section
13.4(c) _(in each case) that is not based upon a Claim, the Indemnifying Party
shall have 30 days from its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the
Liabilities complained of, (ii) admit its Indemnity Obligations for such
Liability or (iii) dispute the claim for such Liabilities. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within such 30 day period that it
has cured the Liabilities or that it disputes the claim for such Liabilities,
then the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to be disputing the claim for such
Liabilities.

interfere with the relationship between Seller and any of its employees, other

other than an Available Employee, contacts Buyer (or any of its Affiliates)
regarding employment in response to an advertisement identifying employment
opportunities published by Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) in a newspaper of
general circulation or on its web site or if an employee of Seller contacts
Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) without having been directly solicited by
Buyer, an Affiliate of Buyer, or representative of either. Buyer shall be
permitted to contact any of Sellers independent contractors whose services
relate to the Assets to discuss post-Closing services. With regard to post-
Closing hiring of Available Employees, _Section 11.7(a)_ shall govern.

 



 

 ** _11.7_** **_Employee Matters_**.

 



 

(a) _Offers of Employment_. _Schedule 11.7(a)_ contains a list of the name,

relate to the Assets at the area superintendent level or below and who are
available for hire by Buyer (the " ** _Available Employees_** "). Seller shall

Available Employees. From and after the Execution Date, and notwithstanding
the Confidentiality Agreement, Buyer shall be permitted to meet with and
interview the Available Employees in connection with prospective employment
with Buyer or its Affiliates and offer employment to any such Available
Employee on terms determined by Buyer in its sole discretion. Buyer is
responsible for scheduling any meetings or interviews and Seller shall
reasonably assist Buyer with respect to such scheduling. Any meetings or
interviews between Buyer and the Available Employees shall be scheduled at
times and places that are not unreasonably inconvenient or disruptive to
Seller or its Affiliates, with reasonable advance notice being provided to
Seller. It is understood that Buyer shall have no obligation to interview or
make an offer of employment to any of the Available Employees pursuant to this
Agreement or for any other reason. Any offers of employment by a Buyer Party
to any of the

 



      
 

 



 

Available Employees shall be in writing (or an electronic document) with an
identification of the employees salary or hourly rate, bonus opportunity,
incentive compensation, and benefits. Buyer shall send to Seller, within five
days after the last offer of employment is made, a schedule identifying each
offer of employment that was made, whether such offer was for compensation
greater than, less than or equal to the compensation currently being paid to
such employee and whether such employee accepted such offer, and effective
upon the expiration or termination of the Transition Services Agreement,
Seller shall terminate the employment of each Available Employee (or cause the
employment of each Available Employee to be terminated) if (i) Buyer has made
an offer of employment to such Available Employee and (ii) such Available
Employee has accepted such offer of employment (and confirmation thereof has
been provided to Seller), (each such Available Employee who then becomes
employed by Buyer as of the expiration or termination of the Transition
Services Agreement shall be referred to herein as a " ** _Transferred
Employee_** "). Buyer shall make all offers of employment to Available
Employees pursuant to this _Section 11.7_ at least ten days prior to the
Closing, and such Available Employees must accept or decline such offers at
least five days prior to the Closing, or else such employment offers shall be
void. With regard to any Available Employee that is not offered employment by
Buyer or declines any employment offered by Buyer as referenced in the
preceding sentence, Buyer, Buyers Affiliates, and any vendor supplying
workers to Buyer to provide services or labor relating to the Assets may not
retain such Available Employee in an employment or other capacity for a period
of one year after Closing, except as permitted under _Section 11.6_. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 11.7_ shall prohibit (A) Seller
and its Affiliates from retaining any Available Employees who do not receive
offers from Buyer or reject their offers from Buyer and (B) Seller and its
Affiliates from attempting to induce any Available Employees to continue their
employment with Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable. Buyer hereby agrees
that it will comply with all applicable Laws in making any employment
decisions and taking any actions pursuant to this _Section 11.7_.

 



 

(b) _Responsibility of the Parties_. Except for Liabilities for which Buyer
is expressly responsible under the terms of the Transition Services Agreement
and/or the Marketing Transition Services Agreement, Seller and its Affiliates
shall retain all Liabilities relating to or arising from the employment of any
Available Employee by Seller or its Affiliates on or before the termination of
their employment relationships by Seller or its Affiliates (the " ** _Retained
Employee Liabilities_** " _)_. Each Buyer Party shall be responsible for all
Liabilities relating to or arising during the period of such Buyer Partys
employment of any Transferred Employees (the " ** _Buyer Employee
Liabilities_** ").

 



 

(c) _Buyer s Obligations_. Each Buyer Party shall be responsible for all
Liabilities relating to or arising during the period of such Buyer Partys
employment of any current or former employees of Seller. Seller and its
Affiliates shall not assume any such Liabilities pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise. The applicable Buyer Party shall be solely responsible for all such
Liabilities and shall indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates harmless
for and all Liabilities arising or relating to the employment by such Buyer
Party of any current or former employees of Seller or its Affiliates after the
Closing.

 



 

(d) _WARN Act_. Buyer shall be solely responsible for complying with the WARN
Act and any and all obligations under other applicable Laws requiring notice
of plant

 



      
 

 



 

closings, relocations, mass layoffs, reductions in force or similar actions
(and for any failures to so comply), in any case, applicable to the
Transferred Employees as a result of any action by Buyer and its Affiliates on
or after to the Closing Date. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
and its Affiliates against any and all Liabilities arising in connection with
any failure to comply with the requirements of this _Section 11.7(d)_.

 



 

(e) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this _Section 11.7_
are solely for the benefit of the respective Parties to this Agreement and
nothing in this _Section 11.7_, express or implied, shall confer upon any
employee (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof), any rights or remedies,
including any right to continuance of employment or any other service
relationship with Buyer, Seller or any of their Affiliates, or any right to
compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever under this
Agreement. Further, the provisions of this _Section 11.7_ do not constitute
the creation, amendment, or modification of any employee benefit plan (with
the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) of Seller or Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates.

 



 

 ** _11.8_** **_Compliance With Tag Right_** ** _. _**Seller, no later than
two Business Days after the Execution Date, shall send to the holder of the
Tag Right a notice seeking to obtain from such holder a written election as to
whether such holder wishes to exercise the Tag Right with respect to its Tag

its right to sell its Tag Right Interests, Buyer shall purchase such Tag Right
Interests (a) for the same proportionate Allocated Value as is allocated to
Sellers interest in such Assets, and (b) on the same proportionate terms as

any Buyer Hedging Party be relieved of any of its obligations under this
_Section 11.9_, and (iii) such Buyer Hedging Party has executed or caused the

deliver to Seller an executed guaranty substantially in the form attached as
_Exhibit R_ (the " ** _Blackstone Guaranty_** "), with respect to AcqCos
payment obligations pursuant to _Section 11.9(e)_.

 



 

(b) At the Closing, subject to _Section 11.9(a)_, Seller shall assign to the
applicable Buyer Hedging Party (or such Buyer Hedging Partys designee
identified on _Schedule 11.9(a)_ ) all of the trades that are the subject of
the Hedging Transactions entered into by Seller for such Buyer Hedging Party
(or such Buyer Hedging Partys designee identified on _Schedule 11.9(a)_ )
pursuant to this _Section 11.9 _and such Buyer Hedging Party (or such Buyer
Hedging Partys designee identified on _Schedule 11.9(a)_ ) shall accept such
assignment from Seller and assume all obligations and liabilities attributable
thereto pursuant to all documentation required by the applicable
Counterparties.

 



 

(c) In the event that any Counterparty terminates any of its Hedging
Transactions, the Buyer Hedging Party for whom such Hedging Transaction was
entered into by Seller shall be obligated for, and shall promptly pay to
Seller, all Hedging Losses resulting from or attributable to such Hedging

(d) Except upon the termination of this Agreement as contemplated by _Section
7.2(b)_, within five Business Days following the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Article VII_ by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be,
Seller shall unwind all Hedging Transactions with each Counterparty and the
Buyer Hedging Party shall be obligated for, and shall promptly pay to Seller,
all Hedging Losses resulting from or attributable to the Hedging Transactions
for which Seller entered into for such Buyer Hedging Party and the unwind
thereof.

 



 

(e) Whether or not the Closing occurs, except upon the termination of this
Agreement as contemplated by _Section 7.2(b)_, the applicable Buyer Hedging
Party shall pay, be responsible for, release, defend, indemnify and hold
Seller and its Affiliates harmless from and against any and all Hedging Losses
for which such Buyer Hedging Party is responsible pursuant to this _Section
11.9 _(the " ** _Hedging Indemnities_** ").

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Hedging
Transactions and the underlying contracts and the actions to be taken by the
Parties in accordance with this _Section 11.9_ are an exception to, and will
under no circumstance constitute a breach of any of (1) the representations
and warranties made by Seller in this Agreement or in any certificate to be
delivered by Seller at Closing, and (2) Sellers covenants contained in
_Section 11.1_ or in any certificate to be delivered by Seller at Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _11.10_** **_Financing_**.

 



 

(a) Each Buyer Party shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
consummate such Buyer Partys portion of the Debt Financing (or any permitted
replacement, amended, modified or any applicable Alternate Financing) on the

Commitment Letters (including the flex provisions set forth in the applicable
Fee Letters), including (i) maintaining in effect such Buyer Partys Debt
Commitment Letters, (ii) satisfying on a timely basis all terms, covenants and
conditions set forth in such Buyer Partys Debt Commitment Letters (including,
to the extent the same are exercised, the flex provisions set forth in the
applicable Fee Letters), (iii) entering into definitive agreements with
respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by such Buyer Partys
Debt Commitment Letters (or on terms not materially less favorable to such
Buyer Party, taken as a whole, except as agreed to by Seller) (including, to
the extent the same are exercised, the flex provisions set forth in the
applicable Fee Letters) (iv) consummating such Buyer Partys portion of the
Debt Financing at or prior to Closing, (v) satisfying on a timely basis all
Financing Conditions within the reasonable control of Buyer, (vi) drawing the
full amount of the Financing required to consummate the Closing in the event

including through litigation pursued in good faith.

 



 

(b) Except with the prior written consent of Seller, each Buyer Party shall
not permit any amendment, modification or waiver of its respective Debt
Commitment Letters that (i) reduces the amount of aggregate cash proceeds
available from the Debt Financing below the amount necessary to finance the
transactions to be consummated on the Closing Date unless such Buyer Party
obtains financing from alternative sources (including by increasing its
portion of the Equity Financing) by a corresponding amount or (ii) imposes new
or additional conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, in each of the
cases of clauses (i) and (ii), in a manner that would reasonably be expected
to delay or prevent the Closing (it being understood and agreed that each
Buyer Party may, without the consent of the Seller, (A) amend or otherwise
modify its respective Debt Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed
such Debt Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement or (B) amend or
modify its respective Debt Commitment Letters to implement the flex provisions
set forth in their respective Fee Letters).

 



 

(c) From the date of the Agreement until the Closing, Seller shall provide,
and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Subsidiaries
and its and their respective representatives to provide, reasonable
cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (or any
permitted replacement, amendment or modification thereof or any Alternate
Financing) as may be reasonably requested by a Buyer Party or its
representatives ( _provided_ , that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business of Seller or any of the
Affiliates), including:

 



 

(i) delivering to Buyer and each applicable Debt Financing Source that are
parties to the Debt Commitment Letters the Required Financial Information on
or before

 



      
 

 



 

the applicable deadlines set forth in _Schedule 11.10(c)_ (for the avoidance
of doubt, the delivery of such Required Financial Information on or before the
applicable deadlines shall not be subject to any commercial reasonableness
qualifier applicable to this _Section 11.10(c)_);

 



 

(ii) cooperating, or causing its accountants to cooperate, with each
applicable Buyer Party in its preparation of the pro forma financial
statements required pursuant to such Buyer Partys Debt Commitment Letters and
any customary comfort letters related thereto (provided that, for the
avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not be required to deliver or cause the
delivery of any such comfort letter);

 



 

(iii) requesting any consents of accountants for use of their reports in any
materials relating to the Debt Financing; and

 



 

(iv) solely with respect to the Assets, assisting each Buyer Party in
connection with the preparation by such Buyer Party of pledge and security
agreements and otherwise reasonably cooperating with each Buyer Party in
facilitating the granting of security interest (and perfection thereof) in
collateral, mortgages, other definitive financing documents or other
certificates, in each case, as may reasonably be requested by Buyer in
connection with the Debt Financing ( _provided that_ (A) none of the
agreements, documents, instruments or certificates described in this clause
(iv) shall be executed except in connection with the Closing, (B) the
effectiveness thereof shall be conditioned upon, or become operative after,
the occurrence of the Closing, and (C) the foregoing shall not require Seller
or any of its Affiliates to take any action that would conflict with or
violate any Law or subject Seller or its Affiliates to any Liability or any
director, manager, officer or other employee of Seller or any of its
Affiliates to any personal Liability);

 



 

it being understood and agreed that all materials and information obtained by
each Buyer Party pursuant hereto may be shared with the Financing Sources;
_provided that_ this _Section 11.10(c)_ shall not require travel or the
obligation to incur any out-of-pocket Third Party costs by any of the subject
Persons in order to comply with the terms hereof and that each applicable
Buyer Party will make reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption associated
with the cooperation contemplated by such Persons hereby. In each case,
Sellers cooperation pursuant to this _Section 11.10(c)_ shall be at the
Buyers written request with reasonable prior notice to Seller, and no such
cooperation by Seller shall be required to the extent it could cause any
representation or warranty in this Agreement to be breached, cause any
condition to the Closing set forth in _Article IV_ to fail to be satisfied or
otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is understood and agreed
that (1) the condition precedent set forth in _Section 4.2_, as applied to
Sellers obligations under this _Section 11.10(c)_, shall be deemed to be
satisfied unless the Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters has
not been obtained as a direct result of Sellers Willful Breach of its
obligations under this Section (other than _Section 11.10(c)(i)_); (2) such
assistance shall not require Seller or any of its Affiliates to agree to any
contractual obligation relating to the Financing that is not conditioned upon
the Closing, that does not terminate without Liability to Seller or any of its
Affiliates upon the termination of this Agreement or that would subject Seller
or its Affiliates to any Liability; (3) in each case, Sellers cooperation
shall be at the Buyer Parties sole cost and expense, and on the Closing Date
or following the termination of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, the Buyer Parties shall promptly reimburse Seller for all
documented out-of-pocket Third Party costs incurred by Seller or its
Affiliates in connection with such cooperation; (4) the Buyer Parties shall
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and their respective
directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all
Liabilities by any such Persons suffered or incurred in connection with the
Financing or any assistance or activities provided in connection therewith;
(5) Seller shall have the right to review any presentations or other material
written information prepared by any Buyer Party or its Affiliates prior to the
dissemination of such materials to potential investors, lenders or other
counterparties (other than to any of the GSO Investors, as defined in UnSubs
Debt Commitment Letter) to any proposed financing transaction (or filing with
any Governmental Authority); (6) except to the extent disclosed to potential
investors and lenders in connection with the Financing (who shall hold such
confidential information confidential), all non-public or otherwise
confidential information regarding Seller or the Assets obtained by any Buyer
Party or their respective representatives shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; (7) Seller shall not be
required to deliver or cause the delivery of any legal opinions or
accountants comfort letters or reliance letters or make any representations
in connection with the Financing; (8) the assistance described in this Section
shall not require Seller to take any action that Seller reasonably believes
could result in a violation of any material agreement or any confidentiality
arrangement or the loss of any legal or other applicable privilege; and (9)
Seller shall not be required to provide any information to Buyer or any
Financing Source that is not then in the Sellers or its Affiliates
possession.

 



 

(d) Each Buyer Party shall use reasonable efforts to keep Seller reasonably
informed with respect to material activity concerning the status of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters. Without limiting the
foregoing, each Buyer Party agrees to notify Seller promptly after obtaining
knowledge thereof, if at any time (i) its Debt Commitment Letter shall expire
or be terminated for any reason or (ii) any Debt Financing Source that is a
party to its Debt Commitment Letter breaches, repudiates or threatens in
writing to breach or repudiation of its Debt Commitment Letter or notifies
such Buyer Party in writing that such Debt Financing Source no longer intends
to provide financing to such Buyer Party on the terms set forth therein (or on
terms not materially less favorable to such Buyer Party, taken as a whole,
except as agreed to by Seller) (including, to the extent the same are
exercised, the flex provisions set forth in the applicable Fee Letter), or
(iii) for any reason such Buyer Party no longer believes in good faith that it
will be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated
by its Debt Commitment Letter on the terms described therein (or on terms not
materially less favorable to such Buyer Party, taken as a whole, except as
agreed to by Seller) (including, to the extent the same are exercised, the
flex provisions set forth in the applicable Fee Letter), in each case to the
extent such event would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent (or result
in the delay or prevention of) the Closing. Each Buyer Party shall not,
without the prior written consent of Seller, take or fail to take any action
or enter into any transaction that would reasonably be expected to result in a
failure of any conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters or any Alternate Financing contemplated by any New
Debt Commitment Letters. Each Buyer Party shall not amend or alter, or agree
to amend or alter, any Debt Commitment Letter in any manner that would prevent
or materially impair or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of Seller.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions set forth in the Fee Letters)
contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters (other than due to the breach by
Seller of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein or as a
result of the failure of a condition contained herein to be satisfied by
Seller), the applicable Buyer Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder (" **
_Alternate Financing_** ") and, if obtained, will provide Seller with a
correct and complete copy of, new financing commitment or commitments that
provide for an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereunder and subject to the same (or no less favorable to Seller) Financing
Conditions as the prior Debt Commitment Letter (the " ** _New Debt Commitment
Letter_** "). In the event an Alternate Financing is obtained (i) in full and
a New Debt Commitment Letter is entered into, references in this Agreement to
the applicable Debt Commitment Letter shall be deemed to refer to the
applicable New Debt Commitment Letter or (ii) in part and a New Debt
Commitment Letter is entered into, references in this Agreement to the
applicable Debt Commitment Letter shall be deemed to include the applicable
New Debt Commitment Letter and the applicable Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

(f) The Buyer Parties shall not consent to any assignment of rights or
obligations under the Debt Financing Commitment Letter without the prior
written approval of Seller, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. The
Buyer Parties shall consult with and keep Seller informed in reasonable detail
of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing. None of the Buyer
Parties nor any of their Affiliates shall take any action that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation
(subject to the terms and conditions hereof) of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Financing.

 



 

(g) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable
terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letters, each Buyer Party shall
take (or cause to be taken) all actions and do (or cause to be done) all
things necessary, proper or advisable to (i) obtain the portion of the Equity
Financing contemplated by such Buyer Partys Equity Commitment Letters
simultaneously with the receipt of such Buyer Partys portion of the Debt
Financing, (ii) maintain in effect such Buyer Partys Equity Commitment
Letters, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to such
Buyer Party as set forth in such Buyer Partys Equity Commitment Letters that
are within its control and (iv) consummate the portion of the Equity Financing
contemplated by such Buyer Partys Equity Commitment Letters at or prior to
the Closing.

 



 

(h) Each Buyer Party shall not amend, alter or waive, or agree to amend, alter
or waive (in any case whether by action or inaction), any term of its
respective Equity Commitment Letters without the prior written consent of
Seller that (i) reduces the amount of aggregate cash proceeds available from
the Equity Financing below the amount necessary to finance the transactions to
be consummated on the Closing Date unless such Buyer Party obtains financing
from alternative sources by a corresponding amount or (ii) imposes new or
additional conditions to the receipt of the Equity Financing, in each of the
cases of clauses (i) and (ii), in a manner that would reasonably be expected
to delay or prevent the Closing. Each Buyer Party shall promptly (and in any
event within 2 Business Days) notify Seller of (A) the expiration or
termination of its Equity Commitment Letter or (B) any refusal in writing by
the

 



      
 

 



 

investors named in its Equity Commitment Letter to provide the full financing
contemplated by such Equity Commitment Letter.

 



 

 ** _11.11_** **_Financial Assurances_**.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall furnish to Seller the information described below:

 



 

(i) On or before the Closing Date, the SN Parties (collectively), on one hand,
and AcqCo, on the other hand, each will provide evidence reasonably acceptable
to Seller that they have or it has, as applicable, Available Liquidity of at
least the Target Available Liquidity. If the SN Parties (collectively) or
AcqCo cannot demonstrate Available Liquidity of at least the Target Available
Liquidity, then at Closing SN or AcqCo, as applicable, shall provide Seller
with a letter of credit or a surety bond for the benefit of Seller and in a
form reasonably acceptable to Seller in an amount equal to the difference
between the Target Available Liquidity and the SN Parties (collectively) or
AcqCos actual Available Liquidity, as applicable.

 



 

(ii) The SN Parties shall provide to Seller written notice within five
Business Days after any SN Party discovers at any time that the SN Parties
(collectively) do not have the Target Available Liquidity, and with the

acceptable to Seller in an amount equal to the difference between the Target
Available Liquidity and the SN Parties actual Available Liquidity. AcqCo

discovers at any time that AcqCo does not have the Target Available Liquidity,
and with the delivery of such notice, AcqCo shall provide to Seller a letter
of credit or surety bond for the benefit of Seller and in a form reasonably
acceptable to Seller in an amount equal to the difference between the Target
Available Liquidity and AcqCos actual Available Liquidity.

 



 

(iii) Each Buyer Party will provide an unaudited balance sheet prepared in the
ordinary course of business and in accordance with GAAP on or before October
31, 2017 for the nine month period ended as of September 30, 2016. Thereafter,

the year 2018), each Buyer Party will provide audited financial statements

including a balance sheet, as of the end of and for the prior year. With such
audited financial statements and additionally on or before October 31 of each
calendar year after the Closing (beginning with the year 2017), each of the SN
Parties (acting collectively), on the one hand, and AcqCo, on the other hand,
shall provide to Seller (A) a written certification executed by an officer of
such Buyer Parties or Buyer Party (as applicable) that such financial
statements accurately present the financial condition of such Buyer Parties or
Buyer Party (as applicable), (B) a report that contains evidence of the
Available Liquidity of such Buyer Parties or Buyer Party (as applicable), (C)
an accounting of the Wells that were producing as of the Closing Date that
were plugged and abandoned after the Closing Date and (D) any changes to

the Party responsible for the Buyer Parties obligations under this _Section
11.11_. Each such report must be certified by an authorized officer of the
applicable Buyer Parties or Buyer Party, as applicable, to be complete and
correct in all material respects to the knowledge of such officer after
reasonable inquiry.

 



       
 

 



 

(iv) If the SN Parties (acting collectively) cannot demonstrate that their
Available Liquidity is at least equal to or greater than the Target Available
Liquidity in connection with the bi-annual report delivered by such Parties
pursuant to _Section 11.11(a)(iii) _above or if such Parties do not timely
deliver all of the information required to be delivered to Seller by such
Parties pursuant to such Section, then, on or before June 5 of the year in
which such Available Liquidity was not demonstrated or such information was
not timely provided, the SN Parties shall provide Seller with a letter of
credit or a surety bond for the benefit of Seller and in a form reasonably
acceptable to Seller in an amount equal to the difference between the Target
Available Liquidity and the SN Parties collective actual Available Liquidity.
If AcqCo cannot demonstrate that its Available Liquidity is at least equal to
or greater than the Target Available Liquidity in connection with the bi-
annual report delivered by AcqCo pursuant to _Section 11.11(a)(iii) _above or
if AcqCo does not timely deliver all of the information required to be
delivered to Seller by AcqCo pursuant to such Section, then, on or before June
5 of the year in which such Available Liquidity was not demonstrated or such
information was not timely provided, AcqCo shall provide Seller with a letter
of credit or a surety bond for the benefit of Seller and in a form reasonably
acceptable to Seller in an amount equal to the difference between the Target
Available Liquidity and AcqCos actual Available Liquidity.

 



 

(b) Each Buyer Party affirms that it will continue to follow an ongoing
abandonment schedule and will act in good faith to maintain the operational
and environmental stewardship achieved by Seller.

 



 

(c) If any Buyer Party sells, transfers or assigns all or any portion of the
Assets acquired by such Buyer Party at Closing, such Buyer Party shall not be
released from any portion of its obligations under this _Section 11.11_
without Sellers prior written consent to such sale, transfer or assignment
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ that Seller shall be deemed to have consented to such sale,
transfer or assignment if (i) such acquiring Person has a credit rating equal
to or higher than at least 2 of the following: Baa3 (or the equivalent) by
Moodys, BBB- (or the equivalent) by Standard and Poors or BBB- (or the
equivalent) by Fitch or (ii) in the case of a sale, transfer or assignment by
either of the SN Parties, on the one hand, or AcqCo, on the other hand, the
acquiring Person provides to Seller a letter of credit or surety bond for the
benefit of Seller and in a form reasonably acceptable to Seller in an amount
equal to $50,000,000 multiplied by the Required Liquidity Ratio; and _provided
further_ any such transferee to whom Seller has consented, or is deemed to
have consented, to in connection with such sale, transfer or assignment shall
expressly assume such transferring Buyer Partys obligations under this
_Section 11.11_. The Parties acknowledge that any determination of whether a
consent pursuant to this _Section 11.11(c)_ is unreasonably withheld shall be
without regard to the provisions of clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, it
being understood that the ability of an acquiring Person to provide the letter
of credit described in such clause (ii) does not constitute a requirement for
Sellers consent. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, the obligations set forth in this _Section 11.11_, including any
related obligations that may be imposed upon a third party transferee of any
of the Assets pursuant to this _Section 11.11(c)_, shall terminate on the
date that is twenty years after the Closing Date.

 



 

 ** _11.12_** **_Successor Operator_** ** _. _**While SN acknowledges that it
desires to succeed each Seller as operator of those Assets or portions thereof
that such Seller may presently operate,

 



      
 

 



 

SN acknowledges and agrees that Seller cannot and does not covenant or warrant
that SN shall become successor operator of same since the Assets or portions
thereof may be subject to operating or other agreements that control the
appointment of a successor operator. Each Seller agrees, however, that as to
the Assets it operates, it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
support SNs efforts to become successor operator (to the extent permitted
under any applicable joint operating agreement) effective as of the Closing
(at SNs sole cost and expense and subject to the terms of _Section 11.15
_with respect to the Marketing Contracts) and to designate and/or appoint, to
the extent legally possible, SN as successor operator effective as of the
Closing (subject to the terms of _Section 11.15 _with respect to the
Marketing Contracts).

 



 

 ** _11.13_** **_NAESB Contracts_**. SN shall use its reasonable efforts to,
on or before at least three days prior to the Transition Termination, enter
into new NAESB Contracts or amend its existing NAESB Contracts, as applicable,
with the counterparties to the NAESB Contracts (such counterparties, the " **
_NAESB Contract Counterparties_** ", and such new or amended NAESB Contracts,
the " ** _SN NAESB Contracts_** "). Such SN NAESB Contracts shall (a) allow
Seller to assign to SN the NAESB Contract Confirmations applicable to the
corresponding NAESB Contracts, and (b) provide that Seller shall have no
liability relating to matters arising after the Effective Time under such
NAESB Contract Confirmations. Upon SN entering into any SN NAESB Contract
Seller or its Affiliate (as applicable) shall, upon the Transition Termination
but subject to the provisions of _Schedule 13.4_ , assign to SN those NAESB
Contract Confirmations related to such SN NAESB Contract.

 



 

 ** _11.14_** **_Tax Treatment_**. Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts, on or prior to the Closing Date, to (a) determine whether the Tax

K of chapter 1 of the Code and (b), if the Tax Partnership meets such
requirements, to cause the Tax Partnership to make such election effective
prior to the Closing Date.

of production.

 



 

(f) From and after the Closing until the Transition Termination or, if either
or both of the Marketing Agency Agreement and/or Midstream Agency Agreement
are entered into by SN, Seller and, if applicable, AESC pursuant to Schedule
13.4, the date when such agreement(s) have terminated, each of SN, UnSub and
AcqCo agrees that all of its production and Hydrocarbons attributable to the
Assets will be transported and/or sold as provided in the Marketing Transition
Services Agreement and, if applicable, the Marketing Agency Agreement and/or
the Midstream Agency Agreement and it will not elect to takes its production
in kind.

(a) From and after the Execution Date and up to and including the Closing Date
(or earlier termination of this Agreement), but subject to the other
provisions of this _Section 12.1_ and obtaining any required consents of
Third Parties, including Third Party operators of the Assets (which consents
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain), Seller shall
afford to Buyer and its officers, employees, agents, accountants, attorneys,

 



      
 

 



 

investment bankers and other authorized representatives (" ** _Buyer s
Representatives_**") reasonable access, during normal business hours, to (i)
Sellers and its Affiliates employees (following at least 72 hours prior
notice to David Richardson at Seller), (ii) the Assets and (iii) all Records
in Sellers or any of its Affiliates possession. All investigations and due
diligence conducted by Buyer or any Buyers Representative shall be conducted

assessments with respect to the Assets. Seller or its designee shall have the
right to accompany Buyer and Buyers Representatives whenever they are on site
on the Assets and also to collect split test samples if any are collected.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not have access
to, and shall not be permitted to conduct, any environmental due diligence
(including any Phase I environmental property assessments) with respect to any
Assets where Seller does not have the authority to grant access for such due
diligence (provided, however, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain permission from any Third Party to allow Buyer and Buyers
Representatives such access). Buyer shall not be entitled to conduct any
sampling, boring, drilling or other invasive investigation activities on or
with respect to any of the Assets without Sellers prior written consent
(which consent may be withheld by Seller in its sole discretion). To the
extent that Seller gives it prior written consent (which it is under no
obligation to give), any such sampling, boring, drilling or other invasive
investigation activities to be conducted by Buyer shall be subject to the
terms set forth in such prior written consent given by Seller.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall coordinate its environmental property assessments and physical
inspections of the Assets with Seller and all Third Party operators to
minimize any inconvenience to or interruption of the conduct of business by
Seller or such Third Party operators. Buyer shall abide by Sellers, and any
Third Party operators, safety rules, regulations and operating policies while
conducting its due diligence evaluation of the Assets, including any
environmental or other inspection or assessment of the Assets. Buyer hereby
defends, indemnifies and holds harmless each of the operators of the Assets
and the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Liabilities
arising out of, resulting from or relating to any field visit, environmental
property assessment, or other due diligence activity conducted by Buyer or any
Buyers Representative with respect to the Assets, **EVEN IF SUCH LIABILITIES
ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM, SOLELY OR IN PART, THE SOLE, ACTIVE, PASSIVE,
CONCURRENT OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR
VIOLATION OF LAW OF OR BY A MEMBER OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES,
EXCEPTING ONLY IN THE CASE OF THIS _SECTION 12.1(C)_ LIABILITIES ACTUALLY
RESULTING ON THE ACCOUNT OF THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF A
MEMBER OF THE SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES.**

 



 

(d) Buyer agrees to promptly provide Seller, but in no less than 5 days after
Buyers or any of Buyers Representatives receipt or creation, copies of all
environmental reports and environmental test results prepared by Buyer or any
of Buyers Representatives which contain environmental data collected or
generated from Buyers environmental due diligence with respect to the Assets.
None of Buyer, any of Buyers Representatives or Seller

 



      
 

 



 

shall be deemed by Sellers receipt of said documents, or otherwise, to have
made any representation or warranty, expressed, implied or statutory, as to
the condition of the Assets or to the accuracy of said documents or the
information contained therein.

 



 

(e) Upon completion of Buyers due diligence, Buyer shall at its sole cost and
expense and without any cost or expense to Seller or its Affiliates, (i)
repair all damage done to the Assets in connection with Buyers due diligence,
(ii) restore the Assets to at least the approximate same or better condition
than they were prior to commencement of Buyers due diligence and (iii) remove
all equipment, tools or other property brought onto the Assets in connection
with Buyers due diligence. Any disturbance to the Assets (including the
leasehold associated therewith) resulting from Buyers due diligence will be
promptly corrected by Buyer.

 



 

(f) During all periods that Buyer or any of Buyers Representatives are on the
Assets, Buyer shall maintain, at its sole expense, policies of insurance of
the types and in the amounts sufficient to cover the obligations and
Liabilities of Buyer under _Section 12.1(c)_ and _Section 12.1(e)_. In
connection with such insurance, Buyer shall cause its insurers to waive
subrogation against the Seller Indemnified Parties. Upon request by Seller,
Buyer shall provide to Seller evidence of such insurance and waiver of
subrogation prior to entering the Assets.

 



 

 ** _12.2_** **_Confidentiality_** ** _._** Buyer acknowledges that, pursuant
to its right of access to the Records, the Assets, Buyer will become privy to
confidential and other information of Seller and that such confidential
information shall be held confidential by Buyer and Buyers Representatives in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement as if each Buyer
Party was a party thereto. If the Closing should occur, the foregoing
confidentiality restriction on Buyer, including the Confidentiality Agreement,
shall terminate (except as to (a) such portion of the Assets that are not
conveyed to Buyer pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, (b) the
Excluded Assets and (c) information related to assets other than the Assets).

 **ARTICLE XIII 
TITLE MATTERS; CASUALTY; TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

 



 

 ** _13.1_** **_Seller s Title_** ** _._**

 



 

(a) _General Disclaimer of Title Warranties and Representations_. Without
limiting Buyers remedies for Title Defects set forth in this _Article XIII_,
Seller makes no warranty or representation, express, implied, statutory or
otherwise, with respect to title to any of the Assets and, Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that Buyers sole remedy for any defect of title, including any
Title Defect, with respect to any of the Assets (i) before Closing, shall be
as set forth in _Section 13.2_ and (ii) after Closing, shall be pursuant to
the special warranty of Defensible Title to the Wells and Leases contained in
the Assignments.

 



 

(b) _Special Warranty of Defensible Title_. The Assignments delivered at
Closing will contain a special warranty of Defensible Title to the Wells and
Leases by Seller whereby Seller warrants Defensible Title to the Wells and
Leases unto Buyer against every Person whomsoever lawfully claiming or to
claim the same or any part thereof by, through or under Seller or any of its
Affiliates, but not otherwise, subject, however, to the Permitted
Encumbrances. For purposes of the special warranty of title to the Wells and
Leases contained in the Assignment, the value of the Assets set forth in
_Exhibit A-1_ and _Exhibit A-2_, as applicable, shall be deemed to be the
Allocated Value thereof, as adjusted pursuant to this Agreement. Recovery on
the special warranty of title to the Wells and Leases contained in the
Assignment shall be limited to an amount (without any interest accruing
thereon) equal to the reduction in the Purchase Price to which Buyer would
have been entitled had Buyer asserted the Title Defect giving rise to such
breach of the special warranty of title to the Wells and Leases contained in
the Assignment, as applicable, as a Title Defect prior to Closing pursuant to
_Section 13.2_, in each case without taking into account the Individual Title
Defect Threshold and the Defect Deductible.

 



 

 ** _13.2_** **_Notice of Title Defects; Defect Adjustments_** ** _._**

 



 

(a) _Title Defect Notices_. The Buyer Party Representative must deliver, on
or before 5:00 p.m. (Prevailing Central Time) on February 22, 2017 (the " **
_Title Claim Date_** "), claim notices to Seller meeting the requirements of
this _Section 13.2(a)_ (collectively the " ** _Title Defect Notices_** " and
individually a " ** _Title Defect Notice_** ") setting forth any matters
which, in

 



      
 

 



 

Buyers reasonable opinion, constitute Title Defects and which Buyer intends
to assert as a Title Defect pursuant to this _Section 13.2._ For all purposes
of this Agreement and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (except
for the special warranty of Defensible Title to the Wells and Leases contained
in the Assignments), Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller shall
have no liability for, any Title Defect that Buyer fails to assert as a Title
Defect by a Title Defect Notice received by Seller on or before the Title
Claim Date. To be effective, each Title Defect Notice shall be in writing and
shall include (i) a description of the alleged Title Defect and the Asset, or
portion thereof, affected by such Title Defect (each a " ** _Title Defect
Property_** "), (ii) the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property, (iii)
supporting documents reasonably necessary for Seller to verify the existence
of such Title Defect, and (iv) the amount by which Buyer reasonably believes
the Allocated Value of each Title Defect Property is reduced by such Title
Defect and the computations upon which Buyers belief is based. To give Seller
an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Title Defects, Buyer agrees to
use reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before the end of each calendar
week prior to the Title Claim Date, written notice of all Title Defects
discovered by Buyer during the preceding calendar week, which notice may be
preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the Title Claim Date. Buyer
shall also promptly furnish Seller with written notice of any Title Benefit
which is discovered by any of Buyers or any of its Affiliates employees,
title attorneys, landmen or other title examiners while conducting Buyers due
diligence with respect to the Assets prior to the Title Claim Date.

 



 

(b) _Title Benefit Notices_. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to deliver to the Buyer Party Representative on or before the
Title Claim Date with respect to each Title Benefit a notice (a " ** _Title
Benefit Notice_** ") including (i) a description of the Title Benefit and the
Assets affected by the Title Benefit (each, a " ** _Title Benefit Property_**
"), (ii) supporting documents reasonably necessary for Buyer to verify the
existence of such Title Benefit and (iii) the amount by which Seller
reasonably believes the Allocated Value of such Assets is increased by the
Title Benefit and the computations upon which Sellers belief is based. Seller
shall be deemed to have waived any Title Benefits that Seller fails to provide
a Title Benefit Notice therefore on or before the Title Claim Date.

 



 

(c) _Seller s Right to Cure_. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure any Title Defects of which
it has been advised by Buyer. The following shall apply with respect to each
Title Defect that Seller attempts to cure pursuant to this _Section 13.2(c):_

 



 

(i) At any time prior to Closing, Seller may provide the Buyer Party
Representative written notice that it will attempt to cure a Title Defect
(each, a " ** _Subject Title Defect_** "). If the Subject Title Defect is
cured by Seller prior to Closing, the Asset subject to such Subject Title
Defect shall be conveyed to Buyer at Closing, and there shall be no adjustment
to the Purchase Price in respect of such Subject Title Defect. If the Subject
Title Defect is not cured by Seller prior to Closing, (A) the Assets affected
by such Subject Title Defect shall be conveyed to Buyer at Closing, (B) an
amount equal to the Title Defect Amount of such Subject Title Defect (as
determined by the mutual agreement of the Parties or if the Parties cannot
agree, by Seller acting reasonably and in good faith) (such amount for each
such Subject Title Defect, the " ** _Defect Cure Escrow Amount_** ") shall be
deducted from amounts otherwise payable at the Closing, and (C) at the
Closing, Buyer shall deposit such Defect Cure Escrow Amount into an

 



      
 

 



 

escrow account established with the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreement pending the curing or resolution of the applicable Subject
Title Defect.

 



 

(ii) Seller shall have a 90 day period after the Closing within which to
attempt to cure each applicable Subject Title Defect not cured by Closing for
which it has given the Buyer Party Representative notice of Sellers intent to
attempt to cure in accordance with _Section 13.2(c)(i)_ above (the applicable
cure period being hereinafter referred to in this Agreement as the " ** _Cure
Period_** "). Buyer agrees to reasonably cooperate with Seller in connection
with Sellers curative efforts, including in connection with any proceedings
before a Governmental Authority; provided, however, Buyer shall not be
obligated to pay any money to any Third Party (other than its or its
Affiliates employees).

 



 

(iii) In the event that Seller believes that it has cured a Subject Title
Defect after Closing within the Cure Period, Seller shall submit the
applicable curative efforts in a notice to the Buyer Party Representative
expressly identified as a "cure resolution notice", together with all
documentation and information reasonably necessary for Buyer to determine if
such Subject Title Defect has been adequately cured. Buyer shall be deemed to
have approved such curative efforts in the event the Buyer Party
Representative does not notify Seller of an objection to the same (and the
reasons therefor) within ten Days after the Buyer Party Representatives
receipt thereof. In the event Buyer so objects, the final resolution of such
Subject Title Defect shall be determined by either (A) the mutual agreement of
the Parties, or (B) the arbitration procedures under _Section 13.2(j)_ below.
Except with respect to curative efforts that Buyer has been deemed to have
approved, each Party retains the right to dispute whether or not a Subject
Title Defect has been cured and whether or not an alleged Title Defect
constitutes a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount with respect to such
Title Defect, and any such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the
dispute resolution procedures set forth in _Section 13.2(j)_, which dispute
resolution procedures may be initiated by either Party on or after the date
that is ten days after the end of the applicable Cure Period with respect to
any Subject Title Defect.

 



 

(iv) Except for each Subject Title Defect that is submitted to arbitration
pursuant to _Section 13.2(c)(iii)_ and _Section 13.2(j)_ (in which event the
Defect Cure Escrow Amount deposited in escrow with respect thereto, if any,
shall remain in escrow pending resolution of the applicable Subject Title
Defect), with respect to each Subject Title Defect that has neither been cured
prior to the expiration of the applicable Cure Period or waived by Buyer,
Seller and Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the Defect
Cure Escrow Amount deposited into escrow on account thereof to Buyer. For all
other Subject Title Defects subject to this _Section 13.2(c)_, within ten
days after the end of the Cure Period (or, if applicable, within ten days
following the Title Arbitrators written decision under _Section 13.2(j)_),
Seller and Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the Defect
Cure Escrow Amount deposited in escrow (or portion thereof) in respect of any
Subject Title Defect (or portion thereof) that was cured to Seller, and pay
the Defect Cure Escrow Amount deposited in escrow (or portion thereof) in
respect of any Subject Title Defect (or portion thereof) that was not cured to
Buyer;

 



 

(v) With respect to each Subject Title Defect that has been fully cured in
accordance with the provisions hereof after the Closing but prior to the
expiration of the Cure Period, Seller and Buyer shall (within 15 days
following Sellers notice of cure under _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _13.2(c)(iii)_ ) jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the Defect Cure
Escrow Amount deposited into escrow on account thereof to Seller.

 



 

(d) _Remedies for Title Defects_. Subject to Sellers right to cure following
Closing pursuant to _Section 13.2(c)_ and Sellers continuing right to
dispute the existence of a Title Defect and/or the Title Defect Amount
asserted with respect thereto and subject to the rights of the Parties
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_, in the event that any Title Defect timely
asserted by Buyer in accordance with _Section 13.2(a)_ is not waived in
writing by Buyer or cured on or before Closing, then, subject to the
Individual Title Defect Threshold and the Defect Deductible, Seller shall, at
its sole option, elect to:

 



 

(i) reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect Amount determined pursuant
to _Section 13.2(g)_ or _Section 13.2(j)_;

 



 

(ii) indemnify Buyer against all Liability resulting from such Title Defect
with respect to the Assets pursuant to an indemnity agreement in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parties (each, a " ** _Title
Indemnity Agreement_** "); or

 



 

(iii) retain the entirety of the Title Defect Property that is subject to such
Title Defect, together with all associated Assets, in which event the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Title
Defect Property and such associated Assets, and such Title Defect Property and
such associated Assets shall be deemed to be Excluded Assets;

 



 

provided, however, (1) Seller may elect the option set forth in clause (ii)
above only to the extent Buyer consents in writing after the Execution Date to
be bound by and subject to such option (such consent to be exercised,
withheld, conditioned or delayed at the sole discretion of Buyer) and (2)
prior to Closing, Buyer may rescind its Title Defect Notice in respect of such
Title Defect by delivering notice thereof from the Buyer Party Representative
to Seller, in which case Buyer shall be deemed to have waived such Title
Defect for all purposes, including for purposes of the special warranty of
Defensible Title contained in the Assignments.

 



 

(e) _Remedies for Title Benefits_. With respect to each Subject Well affected
by Title Benefits reported under _Section 13.2(b)_, as Sellers sole and
exclusive remedies for any Title Benefits, the amount (the " ** _Title Benefit
Amount_** ") equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for such Asset
caused by such Title Benefits, as determined pursuant to _Section 13.2(h)_,
shall be applied as to offset the aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable
to Title Defects and the aggregate Remediation Amounts attributable to
Environmental Defects.

 



 

(f) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for Buyers (i) rights under the special
warranty of Defensible Title to the Wells and Leases contained in the
Assignments, and (ii) rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)_, the provisions set forth in _Section 13.2(d)_ shall be the sole and
exclusive right and remedy of Buyer with respect to Sellers failure to have
Defensible Title or any other title matter with respect to any Asset.

 



 

(g) _Title Defect Amount_. The amount by which the Allocated Value of the
affected Title Defect Property is reduced as a result of the existence of a
Title Defect shall be

 



       
 

 



 

the " ** _Title Defect Amount_** " and shall be determined in accordance with
the following terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Defect Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Defect Amount;

 



 

(ii) if the Title Defect is an Encumbrance that is undisputed and liquidated
in amount, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the amount necessary to be
paid to remove the Title Defect from the Title Defect Property;

 



 

(iii) if (A) the Title Defect represents a discrepancy between (1) Sellers
Net Revenue Interest for any Subject Well and (2) Sellers Net Revenue
Interest for such Subject Well as set forth in _Exhibit A-1_ or _Exhibit
A-2_, as applicable, and (B) Sellers Working Interest in such Subject Well is
less than Sellers Working Interest for such Subject Well as set forth in
_Exhibit A-1_ or _Exhibit A-2_, as applicable, in the same proportion to
such Net Revenue Interest decrease, then the Title Defect Amount shall be the
product of (x) the Allocated Value of such Title Defect Property multiplied by
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest decrease in
such Subject Well, and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
for such Subject Well as set forth in _Exhibit A-1_ or _Exhibit A-2_, as
applicable;

 



 

(iv) if the Title Defect represents an obligation, Encumbrance upon or other
defect in title to the Title Defect Property of a type not described above,
then the Title Defect Amount shall be determined by taking into account the
Allocated Value of the Title Defect Property, the portion of the Title Defect
Property affected by the Title Defect, the legal effect of the Title Defect,
the potential economic effect of the Title Defect over the life of the Title
Defect Property, the values placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller
and such other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper
evaluation; provided, however, that if a Title Defect described in this
_Section 13.2(g)(iv)_ is reasonably capable of being cured, the Title Defect
Amount shall not be greater than the reasonable cost and expense of curing
such Title Defect;

 



 

(v) the Title Defect Amount with respect to a Title Defect Property shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Amount pertaining to such Title Defect Property hereunder;

 



 

(vi) if a Title Defect does not affect a Title Defect Property throughout the
entire remaining productive life of such Title Defect Property, such fact
shall be taken into account in determining the Title Defect Amount; and

 



 

(vii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article XIII_, the
aggregate Title Defect Amounts attributable to the effects of all Title
Defects upon any single Title Defect Property shall not exceed the Allocated
Value of such Title Defect Property.

 



 

(h) _Title Benefit Amount_. The Title Benefit Amount resulting from a Title
Benefit shall be determined in accordance with the following methodology,
terms and conditions:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) if Buyer and Seller agree on the Title Benefit Amount, then that amount
shall be the Title Benefit Amount;

 



 

(ii) if (A) the Title Benefit represents a discrepancy between (1) Sellers
Net Revenue Interest for any Subject Well, and (2) Sellers Net Revenue
Interest for such Subject Well as set forth in _Exhibit A-1_ or _Exhibit
A-2_, as applicable, and (B) Sellers Working Interest in such Subject Well is
greater than Sellers Working Interest for such Subject Well as set forth in
_Exhibit A-1_ or _Exhibit A-2_, as applicable, in the same proportion to
such Net Revenue Interest increase, then the Title Benefit Amount shall be the
product of (x) the Allocated Value of the affected Subject Well multiplied by
(y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Net Revenue Interest increase in
such Subject Well, and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
for such Subject Well as set forth in _Exhibit A-1_ or _Exhibit A-2_, as
applicable;

 



 

(iii) if the Title Benefit is of a type not described above, then the Title
Benefit Amounts shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value
of the Asset affected by such Title Benefit, the portion of such Asset
affected by such Title Benefit, the legal effect of the Title Benefit, the
potential economic effect of the Title Benefit over the life of such Asset,
the values placed upon the Title Benefit by Buyer and Seller and such other
reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.

 



 

(i) _Title Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) in no
event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
provided by Seller for any individual Title Defect for which the Title Defect
Amount does not exceed $250,000 (" ** _Individual Title Defect Threshold_**
"); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price
or other remedies provided by Seller for any Title Defect that exceeds the
Individual Title Defect Threshold unless (A) the sum of (1) the Title Defect
Amounts of all such Title Defects that exceed the Individual Title Defect
Threshold (excluding any Title Defects cured by Seller), plus (2) all
Remediation Amounts of all Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual
Environmental Defect Threshold (excluding any Environmental Defects Remediated
by Seller), minus (3) all Title Benefit Amounts, _exceeds_ (B) the Defect
Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the
Purchase Price or other remedies only with respect to such Title Defects in
excess of such Defect Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, if Seller elects
to exclude a Title Defect Property affected by a Title Defect from the
transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the remedy set forth in _Section
13.2(d)(iii)_, then, after such election, the Title Defect Amount and related
Purchase Price adjustment relating to such excluded Assets will not be counted
towards the Defect Deductible or for purposes of _Section 7.1(d)_.

 



 

(j) _Title Dispute Resolution_. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on
all Title Defects (that Seller has not elected to cure after Closing), Title
Benefits, Title Defect Amounts (that do not relate to Title Defects that
Seller has elected to cure after Closing) and Title Benefit Amounts prior to
Closing. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to agree on all Title Defects that
Seller has elected to cure and Title Defect Amounts relating thereto by the
end of the Cure Period. Buyer and Seller shall attempt to agree on all claims
asserted by Buyer under the special warranty of Defensible Title in the
Assignments within 60 days following Sellers receipt of a written special
warranty claim by Buyer. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree

 



      
 

 



 

by the time period specified above (as applicable) with respect to all such
Title Defects, Title Benefits, Title Defect Amounts and Title Benefit Amounts
in dispute, then such disputes and any dispute submitted by a Party pursuant
to _Section 13.2(c)(iii)_ shall be exclusively and finally resolved pursuant
to this _Section 13.2(j)_. There shall be a single arbitrator, who shall be a
title attorney with at least 10 years experience in oil and gas titles
involving properties in the regional area in which the Title Defect Properties
are located, as selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within 15
days after the end of the Cure Period (the " ** _Title Arbitrator_** "). In
the event the Parties are unable to mutually agree upon the Title Arbitrator
within such time period, then each Party will nominate a candidate to be the
Title Arbitrator, and such candidates so nominated by the Parties shall
together determine the Title Arbitrator. The arbitration proceeding shall be
held in Houston, Texas. The Title Arbitrators determination shall be made
within 20 days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final
and binding upon both Parties, without right of appeal. In making his
determination, the Title Arbitrator shall be bound by the rules set forth in
_Section 13.2(g)_ and _Section 13.2(h)_ and with respect to disputes
regarding special warranty claims _Section 13.1_. The Title Arbitrator,
however, may not award (1) Buyer a greater Title Defect Amount than the Title
Defect Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Title Defect Notice or (2)
Seller a greater Title Benefit Amount than the Title Benefit Amount claimed by
Seller in its applicable Title Benefit Notice. Additionally, the Title
Arbitrator may not award Buyer an amount for any special warranty claim
greater than the amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable Title Defect
Notice. The Title Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited purpose of
determining the specific disputed Title Defect, Title Benefit, Title Defect
Amounts and/or Title Benefit Amounts submitted by either Party and may not
award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to any
matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of
presenting its case. Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear one-half of the costs
and expenses of the Title Arbitrator and each of Seller and Buyer shall bear
their own legal costs and other expenses incurred by such Party in connection
with the arbitration unless the Title Arbitrator determines in writing with
its award and decision a different allocation of costs and expenses between
the Parties. Subject to the remaining provisions of this _Section 13.2(j)_,
to the extent that the award of the Title Arbitrator with respect to any Title
Defect Amount or Title Benefit Amount is not taken into account as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.5_ or _Section 3.6_,
then within ten days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice to
Buyer and Seller of his award with respect to a Title Defect Amount or a Title
Benefit Amount or special warranty claim and subject to _Section 13.2(i)_ and
_Section 13.2(c)(ii)_, as applicable, (A) Buyer shall pay to Seller the
amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Seller and (B) Seller
shall pay to Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by the Title Arbitrator to
Buyer. Subject to the remaining provisions of this _Section 13.2(j)_, with
respect to disputes submitted by a Party pursuant to _Section 13.2(c)_,
within ten days after the Title Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer
and Seller of his award with respect to a Title Defect Amount and subject to
_Section 13.2(c)(iv)_ and _Section 13.2(i)_, (x) Buyer and Seller shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Seller the amount, if any, so
awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Seller and (y) Buyer and Seller shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer the amount, if any, so
awarded by the Title Arbitrator to Buyer. Nothing herein shall operate to
cause the Closing to be delayed on account of any arbitration hereunder and to
the extent any adjustments are not agreed upon by the Parties as of the
Closing and Seller has not elected to cure any applicable Title Defect post-
closing pursuant to _Section 13.2(c)_, the Purchase Price

 



      
 

 



 

shall not be adjusted therefor as of the Closing and subsequent adjustments
thereto, if any, will be made pursuant to _Section 3.7 _or this _Section
13.2_, as applicable.

 



 

 ** _13.3_** **_Casualty or Condemnation Loss_** ** _._**

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary from and after the
Effective Time, if Closing occurs, Buyer shall assume all risk of loss with
respect to production of Hydrocarbons through normal depletion (including
watering out of any Well, collapsed casing or sand infiltration of any Well)
and the depreciation of Personal Property due to ordinary wear and tear, in
each case, with respect to the Assets.

 



 

(b) If, after the Execution Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of
the Assets is destroyed by fire or other casualty or is taken in condemnation
or under right of eminent domain (each, a " ** _Casualty Loss_** "), Buyer
shall nevertheless be required to close and Seller, at the Closing, shall pay
to Buyer all sums paid to Seller by Third Parties by reason of such Casualty
Loss insofar as with respect to the affected Assets and shall assign, transfer
and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of Sellers right, title and
interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards and other rights against
Third Parties (excluding any Liabilities, other than insurance claims, of or
against any Seller Indemnified Parties) arising out of such Casualty Loss
insofar as with respect to the affected Assets; provided, however, that Seller
shall reserve and retain (and Buyer shall assign to Seller) all rights, title,
interests and claims against Third Parties for the recovery of Sellers costs
and expenses incurred prior to the Closing in pursuing or asserting any such
insurance claims or other rights against Third Parties with respect to any
such Casualty Loss.

 



 

 ** _13.4_** **_Consents to Assign_** ** _._**

 



 

(a) Other than with respect to the Marketing Contracts (which are addressed in
_Schedule 13.4_ ) and except for consents to assignment that have been
obtained in writing prior to the Execution Date, Seller, no later than 10
Business Days after the Execution Date, shall send to each holder of a right
to consent to assignment pertaining to the Assets and the transactions
contemplated hereby set forth in _Schedule 9.4_ (and with respect to any
applicable consent to assignment not set forth in such schedule that is not
related to a Marketing Contract, as soon as reasonably practicable following
the discovery thereof, Seller shall send to the holder of such consent to
assignment), a notice seeking such holders consent to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Prior to Closing, Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such consents to assignment (provided that Seller
shall not be required to make payments or undertake obligations to or for the
benefit of the holders of such rights in order to obtain any such consent).
Prior to and after the Closing, Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to
evidence its financial ability (including by providing the materials set forth
in _Schedule 13.4(a)_ ) to own the Assets as such evidence may be reasonably
requested by (i) the lessors under the Leases, (ii) the co-owners of the
Leases and (iii) the counterparties of the Applicable Contracts.

 



 

(b) Other than with respect to the Marketing Contracts (which are addressed in
_Schedule 13.4_ ), if Seller fails to obtain a consent to the assignment of
any Asset(s) prior to the Closing and (1) the failure to obtain such consent
would cause the assignment of the Asset(s) affected thereby to Buyer to be
void or the termination of a Lease or Right-of-Way

 



      
 

 



 

under the express terms thereof or (2) such consent in expressly denied in
writing by the holder of such consent right (each, a " ** _Hard Consent_** "),
then

 



 

(i) other than with respect to the Marketing Contracts (which are addressed in
_Schedule 13.4_ ), the Asset(s) subject to such Hard Consent and all Assets
relating directly thereto, shall be excluded from the Assets to be acquired by
Buyer at Closing hereunder, the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted on
account thereof and, (A) if such affected Asset is a Lease or Well, then the
Parties shall enter into a joint operating agreement covering such excluded
Assets in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit O_ (the " **
_JOA_** ") to govern future operations on such excluded Assets pending the
receipt of such Hard Consent (provided that if a joint operating agreement
with Third Parties relating to such Lease or Well is applicable, the JOA shall
control as between the Parties) and (B) if such affected Asset is not a Lease
or Well, then to the extent permitted under applicable Law and any applicable
contracts, Seller shall hold the affected Asset for the benefit of Buyer after
Closing and provide Buyer with all rights thereto and, effective as of
Closing, Buyer hereby agrees to be responsible for, and defend, indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from, any and all obligations and
Liabilities related to or arising out of such Affected Asset, including the
operation thereof. In the event that such Hard Consent is obtained following
Closing, then, Seller shall assign to Buyer, within 10 days after such Hard
Consent is obtained, such Asset(s) so excluded under the terms of this
Agreement pursuant to assignments in forms substantially similar to the
Assignments; and

 



 

(ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 13.4(b)(i)_, Buyer
may elect by written notice to Seller following Closing to acquire any Asset
(other than with respect to the Marketing Contracts which are addressed in
_Schedule 13.4_ ) relating to any such Hard Consent which has not been
obtained, and if Buyer so elects, then, within 10 days after delivery of such
notice to Seller, Seller shall assign to Buyer such Asset(s) pursuant to an
assignment in form substantially similar to the Assignment.

 



 

(c) If Seller fails to obtain a consent set forth in _Schedule 9.4_ (other
than with respect to the Marketing Contracts which are addressed in _Schedule
13.4_ ) and such consent is not a Hard Consent or such consent is a Hard
Consent and the provisions of _Section 13.4(b)(ii)_ are applicable thereto,
then (x) the Asset(s) subject to such un-obtained consent shall be acquired by
Buyer at Closing (or pursuant to _Section 13.4(b)(ii)_, as applicable) as
part of the Assets, (y) Buyer shall have no claim against, and hereby releases
and indemnifies the Seller Indemnified Parties from any Liability for, the
failure to obtain such consent, and (z) Buyer shall be solely responsible from
and after the Closing (or the date of Buyers acquisition of the affected
Assets pursuant to _Section 13.4(b)(ii)_, as applicable) for any and all
Liabilities arising from the failure to obtain such consent, provided that,
with respect to such consents that are not Hard Consents, for 90 days
following the Closing Date, Seller shall cooperate with Buyer to obtain the
consent of the holders of such consents but Seller shall not be required to
spend any amount or incur any Liability in connection with such cooperation.

 



 

(d) As of the Execution Date, the Parties acknowledge that the consent
attached hereto as _Schedule 13.4(d)_ has been obtained.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE XIV 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS**

 



 

 ** _14.1_** **_Notice of Environmental Defects_** ** _._**

 



 

(a) _Environmental Defect Notices_. If Buyer discovers any Environmental
Condition which, in its reasonable opinion, Buyer determines constitutes an
Environmental Defect, the Buyer Party Representative shall notify Seller on or
before 5:00 p.m. (Prevailing Central Time) on February 22, 2017 (the " **
_Environmental Claim Date_** "). To be effective, each notice of an
Environmental Defect (an " ** _Environmental Defect Notice_** ") shall be in
writing and shall include (i) a reasonable description of the Environmental
Condition constituting the asserted Environmental Defect(s), including the GPS
coordinates of such Environmental Condition (when reasonably available), (ii)
the Asset(s) (or portions thereof) affected by the asserted Environmental
Defect (each, an " ** _Environmental Defect Property_** "), (iii)
documentation reasonably sufficient for Seller to verify the existence of the
asserted Environmental Defect(s), (iv) the Allocated Value of each
Environmental Defect Property (if applicable), (v) the Remediation Amount that
Buyer asserts is attributable to such Environmental Defect and the
computations and information upon which Buyers belief is based (including the
proposed Remediation of such Environmental Defect) and (vi) the specific
Environmental Law that is applicable to the Environmental Defect and the
violation of such Environmental Law (to the extent applicable). To give Seller
an opportunity to commence reviewing and curing Environmental Defects, Buyer
agrees to use reasonable efforts to give Seller, on or before the end of each
calendar week prior to the Environmental Claim Date, written notice of all
Environmental Defects discovered by Buyer during the preceding calendar week,
which notice may be preliminary in nature and supplemented prior to the
Environmental Claim Date. For all purposes of this Agreement but subject to
Buyers remedy for a breach of Sellers representation contained in _Section
9.14_, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived, and Seller shall have no
liability for, any Environmental Defect which Buyer fails to assert as an
Environmental Defect by an Environmental Defect Notice received by Seller on
or before the Environmental Claim Date.

 



 

(b) _Seller s Right to Cure_. Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to attempt, at its sole cost, to cure at any time prior to the
Closing any Environmental Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer.

 



 

(c) _Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Subject to Sellers continuing
right to dispute the existence of an Environmental Defect and/or the
Remediation Amount asserted with respect thereto, and subject to the rights of
the Parties pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_, in the event that any Environmental
Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance with _Section 14.1(a)_ is not
waived in writing by the Buyer Party Representative or cured on or before
Closing, then, subject to the Individual Environmental Defect Threshold and
the Defect Deductible, Seller shall, at its sole option, elect to:

 



 

(i) reduce the Purchase Price by the Remediation Amount;

 



 

(ii) assume responsibility for the Remediation of such Environmental Defect;

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) retain the entirety of the Environmental Defect Property that is subject
to such Environmental Defect, together with all associated Assets, in which
event the Environmental Defect Property and such associated Assets shall be
deemed to be Excluded Assets and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an
amount equal to the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property
and/or such associated Assets; or

 



 

(iv) indemnify Buyer against all Liability resulting from such Environmental
Defect with respect to the Environmental Defect Property pursuant to an
indemnity agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Parties (each, an " ** _Environmental Indemnity Agreement_** ");

 



 

provided, however, in each instance Seller may elect the option set forth in
clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above only to the extent the Buyer Party
Representative consents in writing after the Execution Date to be bound by and
subject to any such option (such consent to be exercised, withheld,
conditioned or delayed at the sole discretion of the Buyer Party
Representative). If Seller elects the option set forth in clause (i) above,
Buyer shall be deemed to have assumed responsibility for all of the costs and
expenses attributable to the Remediation of the Environmental Condition
attributable to such Environmental Defect and such responsibility of Buyer
shall be deemed to constitute part of the Assumed Obligations hereunder. If
Seller elects, and Buyer consents to, the option set forth in clause (ii)
above, Seller shall use reasonable efforts to implement such Remediation in a
manner which is consistent with the requirements of Environmental Laws in a
timely fashion for the type of Remediation that Seller elects to undertake;
provided that (A) if Seller is unable to complete such Remediation prior to
Closing, Seller shall retain the entirety of the Environmental Defect Property
that is subject to the Environmental Defect, together with all associated
Assets, in which event the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal
to the Allocated Value of such Environmental Defect Property and/or such
associated Assets, (B) if Seller completes such Remediation to the
satisfaction of the applicable Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over
such Remediation (or if a Governmental Authority has not been notified by
Seller of the existence of the applicable Environmental Defect, then to
Buyers reasonable satisfaction) before the end of the Cure Period, Seller
shall promptly convey the Environmental Defect Property and all associated
Assets to Buyer under forms of assignment substantially similar to the
Assignments, and Buyer shall promptly pay the Allocated Value of such Assets
to Seller, and (C) if Seller does not complete such Remediation to the
satisfaction of the applicable Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over
such Remediation (or if a Governmental Authority has not been notified by
Seller of the existence of the applicable Environmental Defect, then to
Buyers reasonable satisfaction) before the end of the Cure Period, such
Assets shall be deemed to be Excluded Assets.

 



 

(d) _Exclusive Remedy_. Except as provided in _Section 8.2(a)_ for a breach
of Sellers representations and warranties set forth in _Section 9.14_ and
Buyers rights to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_, the
provisions set forth in _Section 14.1(c)_ shall be the exclusive right and
remedy of Buyer with respect to any Environmental Defect with respect to any
Asset.

 



 

(e) _Environmental Deductibles_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
(i) in no event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other
remedies provided

 



      
 

 



 

by Seller for any individual Environmental Defect (or with respect to any
specific Asset, Environmental Defects in the aggregate) for which the
Remediation Amount does not exceed $250,000 (" ** _Individual Environmental
Defect Threshold_** "); and (ii) in no event shall there be any adjustments to
the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller for any Environmental
Defect (or with respect to any specific Asset, Environmental Defects in the
aggregate) for which the Remediation Amount exceeds the Individual
Environmental Defect Threshold unless (A) the sum of (1) the Remediation
Amounts of all such Environmental Defects that exceed the Individual
Environmental Defect Threshold (excluding any Environmental Defects cured by
Seller), plus (2) the Title Defect Amounts of all such Title Defects that
exceed the Individual Title Defect Threshold (excluding any Title Defects
cured by Seller), minus (3) all Title Benefit Amounts, _exceeds_ (B) the
Defect Deductible, after which point Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to
the Purchase Price or other remedies only with respect to such Environmental
Defects in excess of the Defect Deductible. For the avoidance of doubt, if
Seller elects to exclude an Environmental Defect Property affected by an
Environmental Defect from the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the
remedy set forth in _Section 14.1(c)(ii)_, then, after such election, the
Remediation Amount and related Purchase Price adjustment relating to such
excluded Assets will not be counted towards the Defect Deductible or for
purposes of _Section 7.1(d)_.

 



 

(f) _Environmental Dispute Resolution_. Seller and Buyer shall attempt to
agree on all Environmental Defects and Remediation Amounts prior to Closing.
If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree by Closing, the Environmental Defects
and/or Remediation Amounts in dispute shall be exclusively and finally
resolved by arbitration pursuant to this _Section 14.1(f)_. There shall be a
single arbitrator, who shall be an environmental attorney with at least 10
years experience in environmental matters involving oil and gas producing
properties in the regional area in which the affected Assets are located, as
selected by mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller within 15 days after the
Closing Date (the " ** _Environmental Arbitrator_** "). In the event the
Parties are unable to mutually agree upon the Environmental Arbitrator within
such time period, then each Party will nominate a candidate to be the
Environmental Arbitrator, and such candidates so nominated by the Parties
shall together determine the Environmental Arbitrator. The arbitration
proceeding shall be held in Houston, Texas. The Environmental Arbitrators
determination shall be made within 20 days after submission of the matters in
dispute and shall be final and binding upon both Parties, without right of
appeal. In making his determination, the Environmental Arbitrator shall be
bound by the rules set forth in this _Section 14.1_. The Environmental
Arbitrator, however, may not award Buyer its share of any greater Remediation
Amount than the Remediation Amount claimed by Buyer in its applicable
Environmental Defect Notice. The Environmental Arbitrator shall act as an
expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed
Environmental Defects and/or Remediation Amounts submitted by either Party and
may not award damages, interest or penalties to either Party with respect to
any matter. Seller and Buyer shall each bear its own legal fees and other
costs of presenting its case. Each of Seller and Buyer shall bear one-half of
the costs and expenses of the Environmental Arbitrator. To the extent that the
award of the Environmental Arbitrator with respect to any Remediation Amount
is not taken into account as an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
_Section 3.5 _or _Section 3.6_, then within 10 days after the Environmental
Arbitrator delivers written notice to Buyer and Seller of his award with
respect to a Remediation Amount, and subject to _Section 14.1(e)_, (i) Buyer
shall pay to Seller the amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental
Arbitrator to Seller and (ii) Seller shall

 



      
 

 



 

pay to Buyer the amount, if any, so awarded by the Environmental Arbitrator to
Buyer. Nothing herein shall operate to cause the Closing to be delayed on
account of any arbitration hereunder and to the extent any adjustments are not
agreed upon by the Parties as of the Closing, the Purchase Price shall not be
adjusted therefor as of the Closing and subsequent adjustments thereto, if
any, will be made pursuant to _Section 3.7_ or this _Section 14.1_.

 



 

 ** _14.2_** **_NORM, Wastes and Other Substances_** ** _._** Buyer
acknowledges that the Assets have been used for exploration, development,
production, gathering and transportation of oil and Gas and there may be
petroleum, produced water, wastes or other substances or materials located in,
on or under the Assets or associated with the Assets. Equipment and sites
included in the Assets may contain asbestos, NORM or other Hazardous
Substances. NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, pipelines,
materials and equipment as scale, or in other forms. The wells, materials and
equipment located on the Assets or included in the Assets may contain NORM and
other wastes or Hazardous Substances. NORM containing material or other wastes
or Hazardous Substances may have come in contact with various environmental
media, including, water, soils or sediment. Special procedures may be required
for the assessment, remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of
environmental media, wastes, asbestos, NORM and other Hazardous Substances
from the Assets. For the avoidance of doubt (a) NORM shall not constitute the
basis of a breach of Sellers representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 9.14_, and (b) no Environmental Condition involving NORM shall
constitute the basis of an Environmental Defect unless such NORM is in
violation of Environmental Law.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XV 
MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

 ** _15.1_** **_Exhibits and Schedules_** ** _._** All of the Exhibits and
Schedules referred to in this Agreement constitute a part of this Agreement.
Seller or Buyer and their respective counsel have received a complete set of
Exhibits and Schedules prior to and as of the execution of this Agreement.

 



 

 ** _15.2_** **_Expenses and Taxes_** ** _._**

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise specifically provided, all fees, costs and expenses
incurred by Seller or Buyer in negotiating this Agreement or in consummating
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Person
incurring the same, including, legal and accounting fees, costs and expenses.

 



 

(b) All required documentary, filing and recording fees and expenses in
connection with the filing and recording of the assignments (including the
Assignments), conveyances or other instruments required to convey title to the
Assets to Buyer shall be borne by Buyer. Buyer shall assume responsibility
for, and shall bear and pay, all state sales and use Taxes and transfer and
similar Taxes (including any applicable interest or penalties) incurred or
imposed with respect to the transactions described in this Agreement (the " **
_Transfer Taxes_** "). Seller shall assume responsibility for, and shall bear
and pay, all Asset Taxes assessed with respect to the ownership and operation
of the Assets for (i) any period ending prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
the portion of any Straddle Period ending immediately prior to the Effective
Time. All Asset Taxes with respect to the ownership or operation of the Assets
arising on or after the Effective Time (including all Straddle Period Asset
Taxes not apportioned to Seller) shall be allocated to and borne by Buyer.
Upon determination of the

 



      
 

 



 

actual amount of Asset Taxes, to the extent not taken into account under
_Section 3.3_, payments will be made to cause the appropriate Party to bear
the Asset Taxes allocable to such Person under this _Section 15.2(b)_. For
purposes of allocation between the Parties of Asset Taxes that are payable
with respect to Straddle Periods, the portion of any such Taxes that are
attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period that ends immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall (A) in the case of Taxes that are based upon or
related to income or receipts or imposed on a transactional basis, be deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the Tax year or period ended
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (B) in the case of other Taxes,
be allocated pro rata per day between the period immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the period beginning on the Effective Time. For purposes of
clause (A) of the preceding sentence, any exemption, deduction, credit or
other item that is calculated on an annual basis shall be allocated pro rata
per day between the period ending immediately prior to the Effective Time and
the period beginning on the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) To the extent the actual amount of an Asset Tax is not known at the time
an adjustment is to be made with respect to such Asset Tax pursuant to
_Section 3.3_, _Section 3.4 _or _Section 3.5_, as applicable, the Parties
shall utilize the most recent information available in estimating the amount
of such Asset Tax for purposes of such adjustment. To the extent the actual
amount of an Asset Tax (or the amount thereof paid or economically borne by a
Party) is ultimately determined to be different than the amount (if any) that
was taken into account in the Final Settlement Statement as finally determined
pursuant to _Section 3.6_, timely payments will be made from one Party to the
other to the extent necessary to cause each Party to bear the amount of such
Asset Tax that is allocable to such Party under _Section 15.2(b)_.

 



 

(d) Seller shall timely file any Tax Return with respect to Asset Taxes due on
or before the Closing Date or that otherwise relates solely to periods before
the Closing Date (a " ** _Pre-Closing Tax Return_** ") and shall pay any Asset
Taxes shown due and owing on such Pre-Closing Asset Tax Return, subject to
Sellers right of reimbursement for any Asset Taxes for which Buyer is
responsible under _Section 15.2(b)_. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall timely file any Tax Returns with respect to Asset Taxes required to be
filed after the Closing Date, including such Tax Returns for any Straddle
Period that are due after the Closing Date (a " ** _Post-Closing Tax Return_**
"), and shall pay any Asset Taxes shown due and owing on such Post-Closing Tax
Return, subject to Buyers right of reimbursement for any Asset Taxes for
which Seller is responsible under _Section 15.2(b)_. Buyer shall file any
Post-Closing Tax Return relating to a Straddle Period in a manner consistent
with past practice. Within 15 days prior to filing, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller a draft of any such Post-Closing Tax Return for Sellers review and
approval (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



 

(e) Any payments made to any Party pursuant to _Article VIII_ shall
constitute an adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be
treated as such by Buyer and Seller on their Tax Returns to the extent
permitted by applicable Law.

 



 

(f) The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably in
connection with the filing of any Tax Returns, State and Federal regulatory
reports, royalty payments including related deduction and any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect to these matters for the Assets.
Such cooperation shall include the retention of records and

 



       
 

 



 

information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Buyer agrees to allow access (upon request) to the Assets by
Seller, Seller representatives, auditors and State or Federal representatives
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding.

 



 

 ** _15.3_** **_Assignment_** ** _._** This Agreement may not be assigned by
Buyer or Seller without the prior written consent of each Party. In the event
the Parties consent to any such assignment, such assignment shall not relieve
(a) the assigning Party of any obligations and responsibilities hereunder or
(b) SN Parent of its obligations and responsibilities pursuant to _Section
15.22_. Any assignment or other transfer by Buyer or its successors and
assigns of any of the Assets shall not relieve Buyer or its successors or
assigns of any of their obligations (including indemnity obligations)
hereunder, as to the Assets so assigned or transferred.

 



 

 ** _15.4_** **_Preparation of Agreement_** ** _._** Seller, Buyer and their
respective counsel participated in the preparation of this Agreement. In the
event of any ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption shall arise based on
the identity of the draftsman of this Agreement.

 



 

 ** _15.5_** **_Publicity_** ** _._**

 



 

(a) Neither Party shall make or issue any press release or other announcements
to the general public concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior consent of the other Party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. If either Party desires to make an announcement
to the general public, it shall first give the other Party 48 hours written
notification of its desire to make such a public announcement. The written
notification shall include (i) a request for consent to make the announcement,
and (ii) a written draft of the text of such public announcement.

 



 

(b) Nothing in this _Section 15.5_ shall prohibit any Party from issuing or
making a public announcement or statement if such Party deems it necessary to
do so in order to comply with any applicable Law or the rules of any stock
exchange upon which the Partys or a Partys Affiliates capital stock is
traded; provided, however, that to the extent possible, prior written
notification shall be given to the other Parties prior to any such
announcement or statement.

 



 

 ** _15.6_** **_Notices_** ** _._** All notices and communications required or
permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be delivered
personally, or sent by bonded overnight courier, or mailed by U.S. Express
Mail or by certified or registered United States Mail with all postage fully
prepaid, or sent by electronic mail transmission ( _provided_ that the
acknowledgment of the receipt of such electronic mail is requested and
received by email, excluding automatic receipts, and such notice and
communications are sent promptly thereafter to the reviewing person via
overnight courier, U.S. Express Mail or certified or registered United States
Mail) addressed to Seller or Buyer, as appropriate, at the address for such

entitled hereunder or under any Transaction Document, such amount shall
immediately be paid over to the proper Party. Subject to _Section 2.3_, if an
invoice or other evidence of an obligation is received by a Party and such
obligation is partially an obligation of both Seller and Buyer, then the
Parties shall consult with each other and each Party shall promptly pay its
portion of such obligation or Liability to the obligee.

been obtained prior to the Closing; provided that Seller shall cooperate with
Buyer in satisfying clauses (a) through (d) of this _Section 15.8_ as may be
reasonably necessary; provided further that Seller shall not be required to
incur any Liability or pay any money in connection with such cooperation.
Buyer obligates itself to take any and all action required by any Governmental
Authority in order to obtain such unconditional approval, including the
posting of any and all bonds or other security that may be required in excess
of its existing lease, pipeline or area-wide bond.

INTENTION NOT SO SET FORTH. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TERMS AND
PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF ANY EXHIBIT
HERETO, THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN AND CONTROL;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE INCLUSION IN ANY OF THE EXHIBITS HERETO OF TERMS
AND PROVISIONS NOT ADDRESSED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A CONFLICT,
AND ALL SUCH ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS SHALL BE GIVEN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT,
SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THIS _SECTION 15.9_.

 



 

(d) The terms and provisions of this Agreement are intended solely for the
benefit of the Parties, their respective successors or permitted assigns, and
it is not the intention of the Parties to confer third-party beneficiary
rights upon any other Person; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Financing Sources, their Affiliates and their respective
Representatives shall be express third party beneficiaries of, and shall be
entitled to enforce (and entitled to rely on), _Section 7.2(f)_, this
_Section 15.9(d)_, _Section 15.11_, _Section 15.13_, _Section 15.18_ and
_Section 15.20_.

 



 

 ** _15.10_** **_Parties in Interest_** ** _._** The terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any Person other
than Seller and Buyer and their respective successors and permitted assigns,
or the Parties respective related Indemnified Parties hereunder, any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement;
provided that only a Party and its respective successors and permitted assigns
will have the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement on its own
behalf or on behalf of any of its related Indemnified Parties (but shall not
be obligated to do so).

 



 

 ** _15.11_** **_Amendment_** ** _._** This Agreement may be amended only by
an instrument in writing executed by the Party against whom enforcement is
sought. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 15.11_ or
in _Article VII_, (i) this Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or
modified with respect to _Section 7.2(f)_, _Section 15.9(d)_, this _Section
15.11_, _Section 15.13_, _Section 15.20_, or the definitions of "Debt
Financing Sources" or "Equity Financing Sources", and (ii) no term or
condition of this Agreement with respect to _Section 15.9(d)_, this _Section
15.11_, _Section 15.13_, _Section 15.18_, Section _ 15.20_, or the
definitions of "Debt Financing Sources" or "Equity Financing Sources" may be
waived by any Party to the extent such amendment, supplement, modification or
waiver would modify the substance of such

 



      
 

 



 

sections, in the cases of clauses (i) and (ii), in a manner that is adverse to
the interests of the Financing Sources without the written consent of the
Financing Sources.

 



 

 ** _15.12_** **_Waiver; Rights Cumulative_** ** _._** Any of the terms,
covenants, representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived only
by a written instrument executed by or on behalf of the Party waiving
compliance. No course of dealing on the part of Seller or Buyer, or their
respective officers, employees, agents or representatives or any failure by
Seller or Buyer to exercise any of its rights under this Agreement shall
operate as a waiver thereof or affect in any way the right of such Person at a
later time to enforce the performance of such provision. No waiver by Seller
or Buyer of any condition or any breach of any term, covenant, representation
or warranty contained in this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall
be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such
condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or of any breach of any
other term, covenant, representation or warranty. The rights of Seller and
Buyer under this Agreement shall be cumulative, and the exercise or partial
exercise of any such right shall not preclude the exercise of any other right.

 



 

 ** _15.13_** **_Conflict of Law Jurisdiction, Venue; Jury Waiver_** ** _._**
THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY FINANCING CLAIM) AND THE LEGAL RELATIONS AMONG
SELLER AND BUYER SHALL BE GOVERNED AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, EXCLUDING ANY CONFLICTS OF LAW RULE OR PRINCIPLE THAT
WOULD REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF ANY OTHER LAW. EACH OF SELLER AND BUYER
CONSENT TO THE EXERCISE OF JURISDICTION IN PERSONAM BY THE COURTS OF THE STATE
OF TEXAS FOR ANY ACTION ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY FINANCING
CLAIM). ALL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO, ARISING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY IN CONNECTION WITH, OUT OF, RELATED TO OR FROM THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS (INCLUDING ANY FINANCING CLAIM) SHALL BE
EXCLUSIVELY LITIGATED IN COURTS HAVING SITES IN HOUSTON, HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS.
EACH OF SELLER AND BUYER WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT
OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ANY
FINANCING CLAIM). NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, SELLER AGREES THAT IT WILL
NOT BRING, AND WILL NOT PERMIT OR SUPPORT ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES TO BRING, ANY
FINANCING CLAIM IN ANY FORUM OTHER THAN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK, COUNTY OF NEW YORK, OR IF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION IS
VESTED IN FEDERAL COURTS, THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN
DISTRICT OF NEW YORK (AND THE APPELLATE COURTS THEREOF) AND FURTHER AGREES
THAT (X) THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL SET FORTH IN THIS _SECTION 15.13_ SHALL BE
APPLICABLE TO ANY SUCH PROCEEDING AND (Y) ANY SUCH PROCEEDING DESCRIBED IN THE
PRECEDING SENTENCE SO BROUGHT IN SUCH FORUM AGAINST ANY OF THE FINANCING
SOURCES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD
TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _15.14_** **_Severability_** ** _._** If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of Law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
adverse manner to any of Seller or Buyer. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



 

 ** _15.15_** **_Removal of Name_** ** _. _**As promptly as practicable, but
in any case within 30 days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall eliminate the
names Anadarko and Kerr-McGee and any variants thereof from the Assets
acquired pursuant to this Agreement and, except with respect to such grace
period for eliminating existing usage, shall have no right to use any logos,
trademarks or trade names belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

 ** _15.16_** **_Like-Kind Exchange_** ** _. _**Notwithstanding anything else
in this Agreement, each Party shall have the right to structure the
transactions contemplated under the terms of this Agreement as a Like-Kind
Exchange. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, in
connection with effectuating a Like-Kind Exchange, each Party shall have the
right, at or prior to the Closing Date or any subsequent closing, to assign
all or a portion of its rights under this Agreement (the " ** _Assigned
Rights_** ") to a "qualified intermediary" (as that term is defined in Section
1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) of the Treasury Regulations) or to a "qualified exchange
accommodation titleholder" (as that term is defined in U.S. Revenue Procedure
2000-37) (in either case, a " ** _Qualifying Party_** "). In the event a Party
(in its capacity as an exchanging party, referred to in this _Section 15.16_
as an " ** _Exchanging Party_** ") assigns the Assigned Rights to a Qualifying
Party pursuant to this _Section 15.16_, then such Exchanging Party agrees to
notify the other Party in writing of such assignment reasonably in advance of
the Closing Date. In addition, should a Party choose to effectuate a Like-Kind
Exchange, the Parties agree to use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
one another in the completion of such an exchange, including the execution of
all documents reasonably necessary to effectuate such a Like-Kind Exchange;
provided, however, that (a) the Closing Date shall not be delayed or affected
by reason of the Like-Kind Exchange, (b) the Exchanging Party shall effect its
Like-Kind Exchange through an assignment of the Assigned Rights to a
Qualifying Party but such assignment shall not release such Exchanging Party
from any of its liabilities or obligations under this Agreement and (c) the
non-Exchanging Party shall incur no additional unreimbursed costs, expenses,
fees or liabilities as a result of or in connection with the exchange
requested by the Exchanging Party. Each of Seller and Buyer hereby acknowledge
and agree that any assignment of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
15.16 _shall not release a Party from, or modify, any of its respective
liabilities and obligations (including indemnity obligations to each other)
under this Agreement. Neither Seller nor Buyer, by its consent to a Like-Kind
Exchange, shall be responsible in any way for the Exchanging Partys
compliance with such Like-Kind Exchange.

 



 

 ** _15.17_** **_Counterparts_** ** _._** This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed
to be an original instrument, but all of such counterparts shall constitute
for all purposes one agreement. Any signature hereto delivered by a Party by
facsimile transmission shall be deemed an original signature hereto.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _15.18_** **_No Recourse_** ** _._** Notwithstanding anything that may be
expressed or implied in this Agreement or any document, agreement, or
instrument delivered contemporaneously herewith, and notwithstanding the fact
that any Party may be a partnership or limited liability company, and (x)
other than to the extent expressly provided in the Equity Commitment Letters,
the SN Parent Guaranty or the Blackstone Guaranty (collectively, the " **
_Buyer Security Documents_** ") and except with respect to any issuer of any
letter-of credit provided by an Buyer Party pursuant to this Agreement,
including the Deposit LOC (" ** _Buyer LOCs_** "), and then (in each case)
only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken thereunder by such
named party therein, and (y) other than under the Escrow Agreement or with
respect to any Contract that Seller or its Affiliates have with any Debt
Financing Sources related to the marketing of the Assets (collectively, each,
a " ** _Seller Asset Marketing Agreements_** "), each Party hereto and SN
Parent, by its acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, covenants, agrees
and acknowledges that no Persons other than the Parties and SN Parent shall
have any obligation hereunder and that it has no rights of recovery hereunder
against, and no recourse hereunder or under any documents, agreements, or
instruments delivered contemporaneously herewith or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith
shall be had (a) against any former, current, or future general or limited
partner, manager, stockholder or member of any Party (or any of their
successors or permitted assignees) or any Affiliate thereof or any Debt
Financing Source or (b) against any former, current or future director,
officer, agent, attorney, financing source (including the Debt Financing
Sources), employee, Affiliate, manager, assignee, incorporator, controlling
Person, fiduciary, representative, general or limited partner, stockholder,
manager or member of any of the foregoing, but in each case not including the
Parties or SN Parent (each of the parties in clauses (a) and (b), but
excluding for the avoidance of doubt, the Parties and SN Parent, a " ** _Party
Affiliate_** "), whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate
veil, by or through a claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) by or on
behalf of such Party against the Party Affiliates, by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any
statute, regulation or other applicable Law, or otherwise; it being expressly
agreed and acknowledged that (other than to the extent expressly provided in
any Buyer Security Documents or Buyer LOC and then only to the extent of the
specific obligations undertaken by such named party therein, and other than
with respect to any Seller Asset Marketing Agreement) no personal liability
whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on, or otherwise be incurred by any
Party Affiliate, as such, for any obligations of the applicable Party under
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, under any documents or
instruments delivered contemporaneously herewith, in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on,
in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Party
Affiliate is expressly intended as a third-party beneficiary of this _Section
15.18_.

 



 

 ** _15.19_** **_Remedies_** ** _._** The Parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement contemplated to be performed prior to, or contemporaneous with,
Closing was not performed by Buyer or Seller in accordance with the terms
hereof and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy therefor. Subject to _Section 7.2(e)_, as a result, prior to the
termination of this Agreement, each party shall be entitled to specific
performance to prevent breaches of this Agreement and of the terms hereof
(including the obligation to consummate transactions contemplated hereby,
subject to the terms and conditions hereof), without proof of actual damages
(and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy)

 



       
 

 



 

in addition to any other remedy at Law or equity. In connection with the
exercise of any Partys rights under this _Section 15.19_, the Parties agree
not to assert that a remedy of specific performance is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of
monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach.

 



 

 ** _15.20_** **_Waiver of Claims Against Debt Financing Sources_** ** _._**
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller agrees, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that (a) none of the Debt Financing
Sources (solely in their respective capacities as Debt Financing Sources) or
any former, current or future director, officer, agent, attorney, employee,
Affiliate, manager, assignee, incorporator, controlling Person, fiduciary,
representative, general or limited partner, stockholder, manager or member of
any Debt Financing Source shall have any Liability to Seller or its Affiliates
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the financing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise,
and (b) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (i) will have any rights or
claims against any Debt Financing Source (solely in their respective
capacities as Debt Financing Sources) or any former, current or future
director, officer, agent, attorney, employee, Affiliate, manager, assignee,
incorporator, controlling Person, fiduciary, representative, general or
limited partner, stockholder, manager or member of any Debt Financing Source
under this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated by, or entered into
in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any commitments by the Debt Financing Sources in respect of financing the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) seek to enforce this
Agreement against any Debt Financing Source (solely in their respective
capacities as Debt Financing Sources) or any former, current or future
director, officer, agent, attorney, employee, Affiliate, manager, assignee,
incorporator, controlling Person, fiduciary, representative, general or
limited partner, stockholder, manager or member of any Debt Financing Source
or (iii) bring any claim or cause of action against any Debt Financing Source
(solely in their respective capacities as Debt Financing Sources) or any
former, current or future director, officer, agent, attorney, employee,
Affiliate, manager, assignee, incorporator, controlling Person, fiduciary,
representative, general or limited partner, stockholder, manager or member of
any Debt Financing Source under this Agreement or any other agreement
contemplated by, or entered into in connection with, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any commitments by the Debt
Financing Sources in respect of financing the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, however, this _Section 15.20_
shall not apply to any rights Seller may have under any Buyer Security
Document, any Buyer LOC or any Seller Asset Marketing Agreement.

 



 

 ** _15.21_** **_Buyer Party Representative_** ** _._** Each Buyer Party
hereby irrevocably appoints SN as the sole representative of the Buyer Parties
(in such capacity, " ** _Buyer Party Representative_** ") to act as the agent
and on behalf of each such Buyer Party for the purposes of: (a) any matters
related to the Hedging Transactions, including the entry, assignment, or
novation thereof; and (b) any title and/or environmental matters set forth in
_Articles XIII_ and _XIV_. As the representative of the Buyer Parties, the
Buyer Party Representative shall act as the agent for each Buyer Party and
shall have authority to bind each such Buyer Party. Seller may conclusively
and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon the action of the Buyer Party
Representative as the action of each Seller in all matters referred to in this
_Section 15.21_.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _15.22_** **_SN Parent Guaranty_** ** _._** For good and valuable
consideration, and to induce Seller to enter into this Agreement, SN Parent
hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to Seller the
punctual and complete performance of all obligations of SN under this
Agreement other than payment of the SN Parties Proportionate Shares of the
Purchase Price (the " ** _Obligations_** "). The guaranty set out in this
_Section 15.22_ (the " ** _SN Parent Guaranty_** ") shall remain in full
force and effect until SN has fully discharged all of the Obligations. Upon
default by SN of any of the Obligations, Seller may proceed directly against
SN Parent without proceeding against SN or any other Person or pursuing any
other remedy. Seller may, without notice to, or consent of, SN Parent, (i)
extend or alter, together with SN, the time, manner, place or terms of payment
or performance of the Obligations, (ii) waive, or, together with SN, amend the
terms of this Agreement, (iii) release SN from any or all of the Obligations,
or (iv) release any other guaranty or security for the Obligations, without in
any way releasing or discharging SN Parent from liability hereunder. SN Parent
waives any defenses (but not rights of set-off or counterclaims) which it may
have with respect to the performance of the Obligations, other than defenses
that SN would have under the terms of this Agreement. SN Parent further waives
notice of the acceptance of this SN Parent Guaranty, presentment, demand,
protest, and notices of protest, nonpayment, default or dishonor of the
Obligations. SN Parent represents and warrants that (A) it has the full power
and authority to enter into and perform the SN Parent Guaranty, (B) there are
no bankruptcy, reorganization or receivership proceedings pending, being
contemplated by or, to SN Parents knowledge, threatened against SN Parent,
and SN Parent is not insolvent or generally not paying its debts as they
become due, and (C) the execution, delivery and performance by SN Parent of
this SN Parent Guaranty has been duly and validly authorized and approved by
all necessary corporate action on the part of SN Parent, and this SN Parent
Guaranty constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of SN Parent,
enforceable against SN Parent in accordance with its terms.

 



 

 ** _15.23_** **_Liability of SN Parties_** ** _._** Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, SN and UnSub shall be jointly and severally
liable for all obligations and Liabilities of UnSub under this Agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Seller and Buyer have executed this Agreement as of the
date first written above.
