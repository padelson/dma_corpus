SECTION  2.01. _Effect  on Stock_.  At the  Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part  of  the holder of any shares
of stock of the Company, NHC/OP Sub, or  Parent:

 

 

(a) _Cancellation  of NHC/OP Sub, NHC/OP or Parent-Owned Stock_.  Each 
share of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by NHC/OP Sub, NHC/OP 
or  Parent or their respective Subsidiaries shall automatically be canceled
and  shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange  therefor.

 

 

(b) _Conversion  of Company Common Stock_.  Except  as otherwise provided
in _Section  2.02(e)_ ,  each  share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time (other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with _Section  2.01(a)_ )  shall be  converted into
the right to receive that number of validly issued, fully paid  and
nonassessable shares of Parent Preferred Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio 
and $9.00 in cash (collectively, the " _Merger  Consideration_ "). 
The "Exchange Ratio" is 1.0. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Common  Stock converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
_Article II_  shall no  longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to  exist, and each holder of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective  Time represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ")  shall  cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive  the  Merger
Consideration, certain dividends or other distributions in accordance  with
_Section  2.02(c_ )  and any  cash in lieu of any fractional share of
Parent Preferred Stock in accordance  with _Section  2.02(e_ ),  in each 
case upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with _Section 
2.02(b_ )  and in  each case without interest.

 

 

(c) _Anti-Dilution  Provisions_.  In the  event Parent changes (or
establishes a record date for changing) the number  of  shares of Parent
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective  Time as a
result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,  subdivision,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or similar  transaction
with respect to the outstanding Parent Preferred Stock and the  date  of
such change (or the record date with respect to such change) shall be prior 
to the Effective Time, the per share cash amount and the Exchange Ratio
shall  be  appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of shares of the
Company Common  Stock with the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior  to  such event.

 

 

 

SECTION  2.02. _Exchange  of Certificates._

 

 

(a) _Exchange  Agent_.  Prior to  the Effective Time, NHC/OP Sub shall
designate a bank or trust company  reasonably acceptable to the Company to
act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange  Agent_ ")  for the  payment of the
Merger Consideration and shall deposit with the Exchange Agent  as  of the
Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company  Common
Stock, for exchange in accordance with this _Article  II_ ,  through  the
Exchange Agent, cash and non-certificated book-entry shares representing 
the  shares of Parent Preferred Stock issuable pursuant to _Section  2.01(b_
)  in  exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, and NHC/OP
Sub shall  provide to the Exchange Agent, on a timely basis, as and when
needed after  the  Effective Time, cash and/or non-certificated book-entry
shares of Parent  Preferred Stock necessary to pay

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-4-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

dividends  or other distributions, if any, in accordance with _Section 
2.02(c_ )  and any  cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Preferred Stock in accordance  with _Section  2.02(e_ ).  The  Exchange
Agent shall invest any cash deposited by NHC/OP Sub pursuant to this 
_Section  2.02_   as  directed by NHC/OP Sub on a daily basis; _provided_
  that no  such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable
or the timing  of the amounts payable to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to this  _Article  II_.  Any  interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall promptly be  paid  to NHC/OP Sub upon request.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will  deposit with the Exchange
Agent cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other  distributions, if any,
including the REIT Dividend.

 

 

(b) _Exchange  Procedure_.  As soon  as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, NHC/OP Sub shall cause  the  Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate whose shares  of  Company Common Stock
were converted into the right to receive the Merger  Consideration pursuant
to _Section  2.01(b_ ),  (i) a  letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected,  and  risk of loss and title to the
Certificates held by such person shall pass,  only  upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be  in  such form and have
such other reasonable and customary provisions as NHC/OP  Sub  may specify)
and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates  in  exchange
for (A) the Merger Consideration, (B) any dividends or other  distributions
to which holders of Certificates are entitled pursuant to  _Section  2.02(c_
)  and (C)  cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Preferred Stock
to which such  holders are entitled pursuant to _Section  2.02(e_ ). 
Upon  surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together  with  such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed, and such other  documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of  such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor (x) that  number of whole shares of Parent Preferred
Stock (which shall be in  non-certificated book-entry form) which such holder
has the right to receive  pursuant to the provisions of this _Article  II_
  after  taking into account all the shares of Company Common Stock then
held by such  holder under all such Certificates so surrendered, (y) cash in
an amount equal  to $9.00 per share of Company Common Stock then held by such
holder under all  such Certificates so surrendered plus any dividends or
other distributions  to  which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section  2.02(c_ )  and (z)  cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Preferred Stock to which such holder  is entitled pursuant to _Section 
2.02(e_ ),  and the  Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
In the event of a  transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the  transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration
may be issued to  a  person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is  registered if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in  proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such issuance shall pay  any  transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the issuance of shares of Parent  Preferred Stock to a person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate  or establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of NHC/OP Sub that such Tax has  been  paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section  2.02(b_
),  each  Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent  only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration that  the  holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions of this  _Article  II_ ,  any  dividends or distributions
to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled  under _Section _

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-5-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

_2.02(c_ )  and any  cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Preferred Stock to which the  holder of such Certificate is entitled under
_Section  2.02(e_ ).  No  interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any
cash payable upon surrender of  any  Certificate.

 

 

(c) _Distributions  with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Payment for
Fractional  Shares_.  No  dividends or other distributions declared or made
with respect to shares of  Parent Preferred Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be  paid  to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of  Parent Preferred Stock represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of  any  fractional share of Parent
Preferred Stock shall be paid to any such holder  in  accordance with
_Section  2.02(e_ ),  until  the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with this _Article  II_.  Subject  to _Section 2.02(f_), 
following surrender of any such Certificate there shall be paid to the
record  holder of any certificate representing whole shares of Parent
Preferred Stock  issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly
after the time  of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record  date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares  of Parent Preferred Stock and the amount
of any cash in lieu of any fractional  share of Parent Preferred Stock to
which such holder is entitled in accordance  with _Section  2.02(e_ ), 
and  (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other 
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such 
surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with 
respect to such whole shares of Parent Preferred Stock.

 

 

(d) _No  Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.  All  Merger
Consideration issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates  in 
accordance with the terms of this _Article  II_   shall be  deemed to have
been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights  pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such  Certificates. At
the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time  occurs, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall  be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the 
Surviving Person of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding 
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the last sentence of 
_Section  2.02(f_ ),  if,  after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Person  or  the Exchange Agent for transfer or
any other reason, they shall be canceled  and  exchanged as provided in this
_Article  II_.

 

 

(e) _No  Fractional Shares_.

 

 

(A) No  certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent
Preferred Stock  shall be transferred as Merger Consideration upon the
surrender for exchange  of  Certificates, no dividend or distribution of
Parent shall relate to such  fractional share interests and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle  the owner thereof to vote or to any rights
of a stockholder of Parent. For  purposes of this _Section  2.02(e_ ), 
all  fractional shares to which a single record holder of Company Common
Stock would  otherwise be entitled shall be aggregated and calculations shall
be rounded  to  three decimal places.

(B) Each  holder of shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the
Merger who  would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Parent  Preferred Stock (after taking into account all such shares
held by such holder),  shall be entitled to receive cash (without interest)
in an amount, less the  amount of any withholding Taxes which may be required
thereon, equal to such  fractional part of a share of Parent Preferred Stock
multiplied by  $15.75.

 

 

(C) As  soon as  practicable after the determination of the amount of cash,
if any, to be paid  to  holders of Certificates with respect to any
fractional share interests, the  Exchange Agent shall make available such
amounts, without interest, to such  holders subject to and in accordance with
the terms of _Section  2.02(c_ ).

 

 

(f) _Termination  of Merger Consideration Obligation_.  Any  portion of the
Merger Consideration which remains undistributed to the holders  of Company
Common Stock for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be  delivered to
NHC/OP Sub, upon demand. Any holders of Company Common Stock who  have not
theretofore complied with this _Article  II_   shall  thereafter look only
to NHC/OP Sub for the cash and shares of Parent Preferred  Stock to which
they are entitled pursuant to _Section  2.01(b_ ),  any  dividends and
other distributions to which they are entitled pursuant to  _Section 
2.02(c_ )  and any  cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Preferred
Stock to which they are  entitled pursuant to _Section  2.02(e_ ).  If
any  Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to two years after
the  Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any
Merger  Consideration, any dividends and other distributions payable in
accordance  with  _Section  2.02(c_ )  or any  cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Preferred Stock pursuant  to  _Section  2.02(e_
),  would  otherwise escheat to or become the property of any domestic or
foreign (whether  national, Federal, state, provincial, local or otherwise)
government or any  court, administrative, regulatory or other governmental
agency, commission  or  authority or any non- governmental self-regulatory
agency, commission or  authority (each a " _Governmental  Entity_ ")), 
any  such Merger Consideration, dividends or distributions in respect thereof
or  such  cash shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property  of  NHC/OP Sub, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously  entitled thereto.

 

 

(g) _No  Liability_.  None of  NHC/OP Sub, NHC/OP, Parent, the Company or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable  to  any person in respect of any Merger
Consideration, any dividends and other  distributions thereon payable in
accordance with _Section  2.02(c_ )  or any  cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Preferred Stock payable in  accordance with _Section 
2.02(e_ ),  in each  case delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned  property, escheat or similar law or to NHC/OP Sub
pursuant to _Section 2.02(f_).

 

 

(h) _Lost  Certificates_.  If any  Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an  affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost,  stolen or destroyed and, if required
by NHC/OP Sub, the posting by such person  of a bond in such reasonable
amount as NHC/OP Sub may reasonably direct as

indemnity  against any claim that may be made against NHC/OP Sub, Parent, the
Company  or  the Exchange Agent with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall  deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger  Consideration payable in cash and in the form of
Parent Preferred Stock (which  shall be in non-certificated book-entry form),
any unpaid dividends and other  distributions to which such holder would be
entitled pursuant to _Section  2.02(c_ )  and any  cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Preferred Stock to which such holder  would be
entitled pursuant to _Section  2.02(e_ ),  in each  case pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

 

(i) _Withholding  Rights_.  NHC/OP  Sub or the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the  consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of  shares of Company Common Stock
such amounts as may be required to be deducted  and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code, or  any  provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are  so  withheld and
paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by NHC/OP Sub or  the 
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of 
this  Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common  Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was paid by
NHC/OP  Sub  or the Exchange Agent.

 

 

**(j)** **[Intentionally  Omitted]**

 

 

(k) _Company  Stock Options_.  As of  the Effective Time, each holder of a
Company Stock Option (a " _Holder_ ")  will  receive, in the aggregate, an
amount equal to their option consideration for  all  Company Stock Options.
At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option will  be  cancelled and
extinguished, and the Holder thereof will be entitled to receive  an amount
of consideration equal to (A) the product of (i) the number of shares  of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option and (ii) $24.75 
less (B) the exercise price of such Company Stock Option, without interest 
and  less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under any
applicable  Legal  Requirement (the "Option Value"). The option
consideration payable to each  Holder shall be: (x) an amount of cash equal
to the product of (1) the Option  Value and (2) .3636; (y) a number of shares
of Parent Preferred Stock equal  to  the product of the Option Value and
.6364 divided by $15.75 and (z) cash in  lieu  of any fractional shares
resulting from the calculation in (y) above. All  payments with respect to
canceled Company Stock Options shall be made by the  Exchange Agent (or such
other agent reasonably acceptable to NHC/OP Sub as  the  Company shall
designate prior to the Effective Time) as promptly as reasonably  practicable
after the Effective Time from funds deposited by or at the direction  of the
Surviving Person to pay such amounts in accordance with _Section  2.02(b_
).  Prior  to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt such resolutions
and will take  such other actions as may be reasonably required to effectuate
the actions  contemplated by this _Section  2.02(k_ ),  without  paying
any consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of  the 
Company or the Surviving Person.

 

 

 

SECTION  2.03. _Payment_.  Promptly  after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall pay the REIT Dividend to  the  Holders and those Persons who
were Company Stockholders on the Record Date,  in  accordance with customary
procedures for the payment of dividends.

such Permit that, individually or in the aggregate, would  reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the  Company.

Company, threatened,  against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

 

 

(C) to  the  Knowledge of the Company, there have been no Releases of any
Hazardous Material  at the Company's real property that could be reasonably

any of its Subsidiaries;  and

 

 

(D) (1) neither  the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has retained or
assumed, either  contractually or by operation of law, any liabilities or
obligations that could  be reasonably expected to form the basis of any
Environmental Claim against  the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
(2) to the Knowledge of the Company,  there are no Environmental Claims

reasonably be expected to have  a  Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Each
of Parent and its Subsidiaries has  in  effect all material Permits
necessary for it to own, lease or operate its  properties and other assets
and to carry on its business and operations as  presently conducted and as
currently proposed by its management to be conducted,  except where the
failure to so have in effect, individually or in the aggregate,  has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse  Effect on
Parent. There has occurred no default under, or violation of, any  such 
Permit, except, individually or in the aggregate, as has not had and would 
not  reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.
The  consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement and the Voting Agreement, in and of themselves, would not
cause the  revocation or cancellation of any such Permit that, individually
or in the  aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on  Parent.

 

 

(ii) Except  for  those matters disclosed in Parent SEC Documents and those
matters that,  individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have  a  Material Adverse Effect on Parent:

 

 

(A) Parent  and  each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all
applicable Environmental  Laws, and neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any (1)  written communication that alleges that
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is  in  violation of, or has liability
under, any Environmental Law, (2) written request  from any Governmental
Entity for information pursuant to any Environmental  Law,  or (3) written
notice regarding any requirement proposed for adoption or  implementation by
any Government Entity under any Environmental Law which  requirement is
applicable to the operations of Parent or any of its  Subsidiaries;

 

 

(B) there  are  no Environmental Claims pending or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened,  against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries;

any Environmental Claim  against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries; and

 

 

(D) (1) neither  Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has retained or assumed
either contractually  or by operation of law any liabilities or obligations
that could be reasonably  expected to form the basis of any Environmental

Tax Returns required  to be filed by them and all such Tax Returns are

result in a Material Adverse Effect with  respect to Parent. Each of Parent
and its subsidiaries has paid or caused to  be  paid all Taxes due and
owing, and the most recent financial statements contained  in the Parent SEC
Documents reflect an adequate reserve (excluding any reserves  for deferred
Taxes) for all Taxes payable by Parent or its subsidiaries for  all  taxable
periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of such financial 
statements, except for failures to pay Taxes or to reflect adequate reserves 
that would not result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to  Parent.

 

 

(ii) No  deficiencies, audit examinations, refund litigation, proposed
adjustments or  matters in controversy for any Taxes have been proposed,
asserted or assessed  in  writing against Parent or its Subsidiaries, except
for any such deficiencies,  examinations, litigation, adjustments or matters
that have been resolved with  the applicable Tax authority or that would not
result in a Material Adverse  Effect with respect to Parent. There is no
currently effective agreement or  other document extending, or having the
effect of extending, the period of  assessment or collection of any material
Taxes of Parent.

 

 

(iii) Parent  has  complied in all respects with all applicable statutes,
laws, ordinances, rules  and regulations relating to the withholding of Taxes
(including withholding  of  Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 3121 and
3402 of the Code and similar  provisions under any Federal, state, local or
foreign Tax laws) and has, within  the time and the manner prescribed by law,
withheld from and paid over to the  proper Governmental Entity all amounts
required to be so withheld and paid  over  under applicable laws, except, in
each case, for any failures that would not  result in a Material Adverse
Effect with respect to Parent.

 

 

(k) _Voting  Requirements_.  The  affirmative vote in favor of the
establishment and issuance of the Parent  Preferred Stock (including any

person, other than  Avondale Partners, LLC, the fees, commissions and

reimbursement of expenses, in connection  with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement  based upon arrangements made by or

negotiations with, or furnish any information  with  respect to the Company

after consultation with outside counsel, determines in good  faith that such
action is required in the exercise of its fiduciary duties  under

business days in advance of  its  intention to effect a Change in Company
Recommendation, specifying the material  terms and conditions of any such
Superior Proposal and furnishing to NHC/OP  Sub  a copy of the relevant

and other material documents and (III) prior to effecting  such a Change in
Company Recommendation, it has, and has caused its financial  and legal
advisors to, negotiate with NHC/OP Sub in good faith to make such 
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable it 
to  proceed with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
without  violating its fiduciary duties under applicable law (it being
understood NHC/OP  Sub shall have no such obligation to change any terms or
conditions of this  Agreement); (iv) in the case of clause (C) above, the
Special Committee  concludes in good faith that there is a reasonable
likelihood that such Company  Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, and prior to furnishing  any  information with respect to the
Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with  the Company Takeover
Proposal, the Special Committee receives from such person  an executed
confidentiality agreement having provisions that are no less  favorable to
the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement;  and (v)

information with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries to any person or 
entering into discussions or negotiations with any person) notifies NHC/OP

sions  or  negotiations with any third parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any  Company Takeover Proposal, and request in writing to any such
third parties  in  possession of nonpublic information about it or any of
its Subsidiaries that  was  furnished by or on its behalf in connection with
any of the foregoing to return  or destroy all such information in the
possession of any such third party or  in  the possession of any
representative of any such third party, and use  commercially reasonable
efforts to receive certification of such return or  destruction, and it will
not release any third party from, or waive any  provisions of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any  of  its
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Company Takeover  Proposal.

 

 

(d) Any  disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the  type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) made pursuant to  clause (A) of _Section  4.02(b_ )  shall be  deemed
to be a Change in Company Recommendation unless the Board of Directors  of 
the Company expressly reaffirms that the Merger is advisable, fair to and in 
the  best interests of the Company's stockholders and recommends that the
Company's  stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in
such  disclosure.

**ADDITIONAL  AGREEMENTS**

 

 

 

SECTION  5.01. _Preparation  of the Form S-4, the Joint Proxy Statement and
the Schedule  13E-3_.  As soon  as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company and Parent  shall (a) prepare and file with the SEC
the Joint Proxy Statement and the  Schedule 13E-3 and (b) Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Form  S-4,  in which the Joint Proxy
Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each of  the  Company and Parent
shall and shall cause their respective counsel, accountants  and other
advisors to use all reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4  declared
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after  such
filing (including causing accountants to deliver necessary or required 
instruments such as opinions, consents and certifications) and to keep the 
Form  S-4 effective for so long as necessary to complete the Merger. The
Company  will  cause (and will make provision that its successor cause) the
Joint Proxy  Statement to be mailed to the Company's stockholders for
purposes of approving  the Consolidation and the Merger, and Parent will
cause the Joint Proxy  Statement to be mailed to Parent's stockholders, in
each case as promptly as  practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act.  Parent shall also take any action (other
than qualifying to do business in  any  jurisdiction in which it is not now
so qualified or filing a general consent  to  service of process) reasonably
required to be taken under any applicable state  securities laws in
connection with the issuance of Parent Preferred Stock in  the  Merger, and
the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company  and  the
holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested by Parent 
in  connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and
distribution  of  the Joint Proxy Statement and the Form S-4. The parties
shall cooperate and  notify each other promptly of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or the  staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC
or the staff of the SEC for  amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy
Statement, the Form S-4 or the  Schedule 13E-3 or for additional information,

respect  to  the Joint Proxy Statement, the Form S-4, the Schedule 13E-3,
the Merger or  the  other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Voting Agreement.  No  filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form
S-4 will be made by Parent,  and no filing, or amendment or supplement to,
the Joint Proxy Statement or  the  Schedule 13E-3 will be made by Parent or
the Company, in each case (i) without  providing the other party a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon  or (ii) without the approval of
both Parent and the Company, which approval  shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; provided, that, with respect  to  documents filed by a
party hereto that are incorporated by reference in the  Form  S-4 or Joint
Proxy Statement, this right of approval shall apply only with  respect to
information relating to the other party or its business, financial  condition
or results of operations or the Merger. If at any time prior to the 
Effective Time any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of 
their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by 
the  Company or Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to  any  of the Form S-4, the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Schedule 13E-3 (including  the  consummation of the Company Reorganization
or the Consolidation), so that any  such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit  to  state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light  of  the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party that  discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and  an

**CERTIFICATE  OF DESIGNATIONS**

 

 

**OF** 

 

 

**SERIES  A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK SETTING FORTH THE POWERS, PREFERENCES
AND RIGHTS,  AND THE QUALIFICATIONS, LIMITATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS THEREOF, OF
SUCH PREFERRED  STOCK OF NATIONAL HEALTHCARE CORPORATION**

 

 

Pursuant  to Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware, National  HealthCare Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "),  does  hereby certify that the Board of Directors of the
Company (the " _Board  of Directors_ ")  duly  adopted the following
resolution and that such resolution has not been modified  and is in full
force and effect:

 

 

RESOLVED  that, pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of Directors in
accordance  with the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company (the  " _Certificate  of Incorporation_ "),  a  series of
preferred stock of the Company is hereby created and the designation  and
number of shares thereof and the voting powers, preferences and relative, 
participating, optional and other special rights of the shares of such
series,  and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, are as
set  forth  below in this Certificate of Designations (this " _Certificate_
"):

 

 

SECTION  1. _Number;  Designation; Registered Form_. 

 

 

(a) The  shares  of such series shall be designated as "Series A Convertible
Preferred  Stock" (the " _Preferred  Stock_ ")  and  shall have a par
value of $0.01 per share. The number of shares constituting  the  Preferred
Stock shall be  [ ]. Certificates for  shares of Preferred Stock shall be
issuable only in registered form. The  Preferred Stock is being issued as
part of the consideration in the merger  (the " _Merger_ ")  of  National
Health Realty, Inc. with and into an indirect wholly owned subsidiary  of the
Company.

 

 

(b) All  shares  of Preferred Stock redeemed, purchased, exchanged,
converted or otherwise  acquired by the Company shall be retired and canceled
and, upon the taking  of  any action required by applicable law, shall be
restored to the status of  authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock
of the Company, without  designation as to series, and may thereafter be
reissued.

 

 

(c) Capitalized  terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the
respective meanings  set forth in Section 10 below.

 

 

SECTION  2. _Ranking_.  The  Preferred Stock will rank, with respect to
dividend rights and rights upon  liquidation, winding-up or dissolution:

 

 

(a) junior  to  Senior Stock;

 

 

(b) on  a  parity with Parity Stock; and

 

 

(c) senior  to  Junior Stock.

 

 

SECTION  3. _Dividends_. 

 

 

(a) The  holders of shares of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive,
when, as  and  if dividends are declared by the Board of Directors, or any
duly authorized  committee thereof, dividends at the rate of US$0.80 per
annum per share of  Preferred Stock, to be payable in cash out of funds
legally available therefor  on each Dividend Payment Date, as set forth
below. Declared dividends will  be  payable on [ ],  [ ],  [ ] and  [ ]
of each year (each, a " _Dividend  Payment Date_ "),  beginning on the 
first  such date to occur after the Issue Date.  If any  of those dates is
not a Business Day, then such dividends will be payable  on the  next
succeeding Business Day. The dividends payable on any Dividend Payment 
Date  will accrue from the last Dividend Payment Date or, prior to the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

first  Dividend Payment Date, the Issue Date. Declared dividends will be
payable  to  holders of record as they appear in the Company's stock records
at the close of  business on the date which is 30 days prior to the Dividend
Payment Date;  _provided_ ,  that if  any such date is not a Business Day,
then to the holders of record on the  next  succeeding Business Day (each, a
" _Dividend  Payment Record Date_ ").  Dividends payable on the shares of
Preferred Stock will be computed on the  basis  of a 360-day year consisting
of twelve 30-day months.

 

 

(b) Dividends  on the Convertible Preferred Stock are cumulative. If the
Board of Directors  or  any authorized committee thereof fails to declare a
dividend to be payable  on a  Dividend Payment Date, the dividend will
accumulate on that Dividend Payment  Date until declared and paid or will be
forfeited upon conversion, except  under  the circumstances described in
Section 7(c) and 7(f).

 

 

(c) The  Company shall not be obligated to pay holders of Preferred Stock any
interest  or  sum of money in lieu of interest on any dividend not paid on a
Dividend Payment  Date or any other late payment. If the Board of Directors
or an authorized  committee thereof does not declare a dividend for any
Dividend Payment Date,  the  Board of Directors or an authorized committee
thereof may declare and pay  the  dividend on any subsequent date, whether
or not a Dividend Payment Date.  The  persons entitled to receive the
dividend in such case will be holders of  Preferred Stock as they appear on
the stock register on a date selected by  the  Board of Directors or an
authorized committee thereof. That date must not  (a)  precede the date the
Board of Directors or an authorized committee thereof  declares the dividend
payable or (b) be more than 60 days prior to that  Dividend Payment Date.

 

 

SECTION  4. _Liquidation  Preference_. 

 

 

(a) Upon  any  voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-
up of the Company,  each holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
payment out of the assets  of  the Company legally available for
distribution of an amount equal to the  Liquidation Preference of the shares
held by such holder, plus an amount  equal  to all accrued and unpaid and
accumulated dividends on those shares to but  excluding the date of
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, before any  distribution is made on
any Junior Stock, including Common Stock. After payment  in full of the
Liquidation Preference and an amount equal to all accrued  and  unpaid and
accumulated dividends to which holders of shares of Preferred  Stock  are
entitled, such holders shall not be entitled to any further participation 
in  any distribution of the assets of the Company. If, upon any voluntary
or  involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, the
amounts  payable with respect to shares of Preferred Stock and all other
Parity Stock  are  not paid in full, the holders of shares of Preferred
Stock and the holders  of  the Parity Stock shall share equally and ratably
in any distribution of assets  of the Company in proportion to the full
liquidation preference and an amount  equal to all accrued and unpaid and
accumulated dividends, if any, to which  each  such holder is entitled.

 

 

(b) Neither  the voluntary sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer, for cash,
shares of  stock,  securities or other consideration, of all or
substantially all of the property  or assets of the Company nor the
consolidation, merger or amalgamation of  the  Company with or into any
other entity or the consolidation, merger or  amalgamation of any other
entity with or into the Company shall be deemed  to be  a voluntary or
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the  Company.

 

 

SECTION  5. _Optional  Redemption_.

 

 

(a) The  Company may not redeem any shares of Preferred Stock at any time
before the  fifth anniversary of the Issue Date. Subject to Section 5(b)
below, at any  time  or from time to time thereafter, the Company will have
the option to redeem  all  or any outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, out
of funds legally available  for  such payment, upon not less than 30 nor
more than 60 days' prior notice (the "Redemption Notice"), in cash at a
redemption price of $15.75 per share of  Preferred Stock, plus an amount in
cash equal to all accrued and unpaid or  accumulated dividends from, and
including, the immediately preceding Dividend  Payment Date to, but
excluding, the redemption date.

 

 

In  the  event of a partial redemption of the Preferred Stock, the shares to
be redeemed  will be selected on a pro rata basis, except that the Company
may redeem  all  shares of Preferred Stock held by any holder of fewer than
100 shares (or  all  shares of Preferred Stock owned by any holder who would
hold fewer than 100  shares as a result of such redemption), as determined by
the Board of Directors  or a duly authorized committee thereof.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-2-  

 

 

 

 

 


 



 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  Section 5(a) above, the Company may not redeem all or
any outstanding shares  of  Preferred Stock on or after the fifth
anniversary of the Issue Date and prior  to  the eighth anniversary of the
Issue Date, unless the average Sale Price of  the  Common Stock for the 20
Trading Days ending on the Trading Day prior to the  date  the Company gives
notice of such redemption pursuant to this Section 5 equals  or  exceeds the
Conversion Price in effect on such Trading Day. For the avoidance  of 
doubt, this Section 5(b) shall not apply to any Company redemption of 
outstanding shares of Preferred Stock on or after the eighth anniversary  of
the  Issue Date.

 

 

(c) In  the  case of any redemption pursuant to Section 5(a):

 

 

(i) Payment  of  the redemption price for Preferred Stock is conditioned
upon book-entry transfer  of or physical delivery of the certificates
representing the Preferred Stock,  together with necessary endorsements, to
the Registrar at any time after  delivery of the Redemption Notice. Payment
of the redemption price for the  Preferred Stock will be made promptly
following the later of the redemption  date  and book-entry transfer of or
physical delivery of the certificates representing  the Preferred Stock,
together with necessary endorsements, to the  Registrar.

 

 

(ii) If  DTC and  the Registrar hold for such purpose money sufficient to
pay the redemption  price  of Preferred Stock on the redemption date for
shares of Preferred Stock  delivered for redemption in accordance with the
terms of this Certificate,  then  the dividends will cease to accrue. At
such time, all rights of a holder  as a  holder of Preferred Stock shall
terminate, other than the right to receive  the  redemption price upon book-
entry transfer of or physical delivery of the  certificates representing the
Preferred Stock, together with necessary  endorsements.

 

 

SECTION  6. _Voting  Rights_. 

 

 

(a) Holders  of  Preferred Stock will not have any voting rights except as
from time to time  required under the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware and as  set  forth in this Section 6 and Section 14 hereto. The
holder of each share of  Preferred Stock shall have the right to one vote for
each share of Common  Stock  into which such share of Preferred Stock could
then be converted (with any  fractional share, determined on an aggregate
conversion basis, being rounded  to  the nearest whole share) and, with
respect to such vote, such holder shall  have  full voting rights and powers
equal to the voting rights and powers of the  holders of shares of Common
Stock, and shall be entitled to notice of any  stockholders' meeting in
accordance with the Bylaws of the Company, and, except  as provided in this
Section 6 and Section 14 hereto, shall be entitled to  vote,  together with
holders of shares of Common Stock, as a single class with respect  to any
question or matter upon which holders of shares of Common Stock have  the 
right to vote.

 

 

(b) If  and  whenever six full quarterly dividends, whether or not
consecutive, payable  on  the Preferred Stock are not paid, the number of
directors constituting the  Board  of Directors will be increased by two and
the holders of Preferred Stock,  voting  together as a single class, will be
entitled to elect those additional  directors. In the event of such a non-
payment, any holder of Preferred Stock  may  request that the Company call a
special meeting of the holders of Preferred  Stock for the purpose of
electing the additional directors, and the Company  must  call such meeting
within twenty (20) days of request. If the Company fails  to  call such a
meeting upon request, then any holder of Preferred Stock can  call  such a
meeting. If all accumulated dividends on the Preferred Stock have  been 
paid in full and dividends for the current quarterly dividend period have 
been  paid, the holders of Preferred Stock will no longer have the right to
vote  on  directors and the term of office of each director so elected will
terminate  and  the number of members of the Board of Directors will,
without further action,  be  reduced by two. The voting rights provided in
this Section 6(b) represent  the  sole remedy available to the holders of
Preferred Stock for the Company's  failure to pay dividends on Preferred
Stock.

 

 

(c) In  any  case where the holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote
as a class  under  this Section 6 or Section 14 hereto, each holder of
Preferred Stock will  be  entitled to one vote for each share of Preferred
Stock owned by such  holder.

SECTION  7. _Conversion  Rights_. 

 

 

(a) Each  share  of Preferred Stock shall be convertible at the option of
the holder thereof,  unless previously redeemed, into fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common  Stock at an initial conversion price of
$65.07 per share, adjusted as described  below in Section 8 (the "
_Conversion  Price_ ").  The  number of shares of Common Stock deliverable
upon conversion of a share of  Preferred Stock (the " _Conversion  Rate_
")  will be  initially 0.24204, which represents the Liquidation Preference
divided by  the  initial Conversion Price. The Conversion Rate will be
adjusted as a result  of  any adjustment to the Conversion Price.

 

 

(b) A  holder  of shares of Preferred Stock may convert any or all of those
shares by  surrendering to the Company at its principal office or at the
office of the  Registrar, as may be designated by the Board of Directors, the
certificate  or  certificates for those shares of Preferred Stock
accompanied by a written  notice  stating that the holder elects to convert
all or a specified whole number  of  those shares in accordance with this
Section 7 and specifying the name or  names in which the holder wishes the
certificate or certificates for shares  of  Common Stock to be issued. In
case the notice specifies a name or names other  than that of the holder, the
notice must be accompanied by payment of all  transfer taxes payable upon the
issuance of shares of Common Stock in that  name  or names. Other than those
taxes, the Company shall pay any documentary,  stamp  or similar issue or
transfer taxes that may be payable in respect of any  issuance or delivery of
shares of Common Stock upon conversion of shares  of  Preferred Stock. As
promptly as practicable after the surrender of that  certificate or
certificates and the receipt of the notice relating to the  conversion and
payment of all required transfer taxes, if any, or the  demonstration to the
Company's satisfaction that those taxes have been paid, the  Company will
deliver or cause to be delivered (i) certificates representing  the  number
of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable full shares of Common  Stock
to which the holder, or the holder's transferee, of shares of Preferred 
Stock being converted will be entitled and (ii) if less than the full  number
of shares of Preferred Stock evidenced by the surrendered certificate  or 
certificates is being converted, a new certificate or certificates, of like 
tenor, for the number of shares evidenced by the surrendered certificate 
or  certificates less the number of shares being converted. Such conversion
will  be  deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date of
giving the  notice and of surrendering the certificate or certificates
representing the  shares of Preferred Stock to be converted so that the
rights of the holder  thereof as to the shares being converted will cease
except for the right  to  receive shares of Common Stock and accrued and
unpaid dividends with respect  to  the shares of Preferred Stock being
converted, and the person entitled to  receive the shares of Common Stock
will be treated for all purposes as having  become the record holder of those
shares of Common Stock at such time. If  any  conversion under this Section
7 would result in the issuance of a fractional  share of Common Stock, the
Company at its option and in its sole and absolute  discretion may either
issue such fractional share or pay the holder the value  of  such fractional
share.

 

 

(c) If  a  holder of shares of Preferred Stock exercises such holder's
conversion rights,  upon delivery of the shares for conversion, those shares
will cease to accrue  dividends as of the end of the day immediately
preceding the date of conversion.  Holders of shares of Preferred Stock who
convert their shares into Common  Stock  will not be entitled to, nor will
the Conversion Price or Conversion Rate  be  adjusted for, any accrued and
unpaid or accumulated dividends. Notwithstanding  the prior sentence, if
shares of Preferred Stock are converted into Common  Stock  during the
period between the close of business on any Dividend Record Date  and  the
opening of business on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date, holders  of 
such shares of Preferred Stock at the close of business on the Dividend
Record  Date will receive dividends declared and payable on such shares, if
any,  on such  Dividend Payment Date. Such shares of Preferred Stock
surrendered for conversion  must be accompanied by funds equal to the
dividend declared and payable on  such  shares, if any, on such Dividend
Payment Date.

 

 

(d) In  case  any shares of Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the right of
conversion  shall  cease and terminate, as to the shares of Preferred Stock
to be redeemed,  at the  close of business on the Business Day immediately
preceding the date fixed  for  redemption, unless the Company shall default
in the payment of the redemption  price of those shares.

 

 

(e) The  Company shall at all times reserve and keep available, free from
preemptive  rights, for issuance upon the conversion of shares of Preferred
Stock a number  of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock that
will from time  to  time be sufficient if necessary to permit the conversion
of all Outstanding  shares of Preferred Stock. Prior to the delivery of any
securities that the  Company shall be obligated to deliver upon conversion

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-4-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

of  the  Preferred Stock, the Company shall comply with all applicable
federal and  state  laws and regulations which require action to be taken by
the Company. All  shares  of Common Stock delivered upon conversion of the
Preferred Stock will upon  delivery be duly and validly issued and fully paid
and nonassessable, free  of  all liens and charges and not subject to any
preemptive rights. The Company  shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain at all times until the  date on  which no Preferred Stock is
Outstanding the listing and trading of the Common  Stock and Preferred Stock
on a United States national securities  exchange.

 

 

(f) _Conversion  at Our Option Under Certain Circumstances_.  If fewer 
than 5% of the aggregate number of shares of Preferred Stock issued on the 
Issue  Date remain outstanding, the Company may, at any time on or after the
third  anniversary of the Issue Date at its option, cause all, but not less
than  all,  of such Preferred Stock to be automatically converted (a "
_Company  Conversion_ ")  into  that number of shares of Common Stock equal
to the Liquidation Preference  thereof plus all accrued and unpaid or
accumulated dividends divided by the  lesser of (i) the Conversion Price, and
(ii) the Market Price of the  Common Stock. The Company will notify each of
the holders of Preferred Stock  by  mail of such a Company Conversion. Such
notice shall specify the date of  such  Company Conversion which will not be
less than 30 days nor more than 60 days  after the date of such notice.

 

 

SECTION  8. _Adjustments  to the Conversion Price_. 

 

 

(a) The  Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as
follows: 

 

 

(i) _Stock  Splits and Combinations_.  In case  the Company shall, at any
time or from time to time after the Issue Date,  (A)  subdivide or split the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, (B) combine or  reclassify the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of  shares or (C)
issue by reclassification of the shares of Common Stock any  shares  of
Capital Stock of the Company, then, and in each such case, the Conversion 
Price in effect immediately prior to that event or the record date therefor, 
whichever is earlier, shall be adjusted so that the holder of any shares 
of  Preferred Stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled
to  receive the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities of the
Company  which the holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive
after  the  occurrence of any of the events described above, had those
shares of Preferred  Stock been surrendered for conversion immediately prior
to the occurrence  of  that event or the record date therefor, whichever is
earlier.

 

 

(ii) _Stock  Dividends in Common Stock_.  In case  the Company shall, at
any time or from time to time after the Issue Date,  pay a  dividend or make
a distribution in shares of Common Stock to all of the holders  of the Common
Stock other than dividends or distributions of shares of Common  Stock or
other securities with respect to which adjustments are provided  in  Section
8(a)(i) above, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted by multiplying  (A) 
the Conversion Price immediately prior to the record date fixed for 
determination of stockholders entitled to receive the dividend or
distribution,  by (B) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number
of shares of  Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on that
record date and  the  denominator of which shall be the sum of that number
of shares and the total  number of shares of Common Stock issued in that
dividend or  distribution.

 

 

(iii) _Fundamental  Changes_.  In case  any transaction or event
(including, without limitation, any merger,  consolidation, combination, sale
of assets, tender or exchange offer,  reclassification, compulsory share
exchange or liquidation) shall occur in  which  all or substantially all
outstanding shares of Common Stock are converted  into  or exchanged or
acquired for or constitute the right to receive stock, other  securities,
cash, property or assets (each, a " _Fundamental  Change_ "),  the  holder
of each share of Preferred Stock Outstanding immediately prior to  the 
occurrence of such Fundamental Change that remains Outstanding after such 
Fundamental Change shall have the right upon any subsequent conversion to 
receive (but only out of funds legally available, to the extent required 
by  applicable law) the kind and amount of stock, other securities, cash,
property  or assets that such holder would have received if that share had
been converted  immediately prior to the Fundamental Change.

 

 

(b) Anything  in paragraph (a) to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company
shall not be  required to give effect to any adjustment in the Conversion
Price unless  and  until the net effect of one or more adjustments (each of
which shall be carried  forward until counted toward adjustment), determined
as above provided, shall  have

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-5-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

resulted  in a change of the Conversion Price by at least l%, and when the
cumulative  net  effect of more than one adjustment so determined shall be
to change the  Conversion Price by at least 1%, such change in the Conversion
Price shall  thereupon be given effect. In the event that, at any time as a
result of  the  provisions of this Section 8, the holders of shares of
Preferred Stock upon  subsequent conversion shall become entitled to receive
any shares of Capital  Stock of the Company other than Common Stock, the
number of such other shares  so  receivable upon conversion of shares of
Preferred Stock shall thereafter  be  subject to adjustment from time to
time in a manner and on terms as nearly  equivalent as practicable to the
provisions contained in this Section  8.

 

 

(c) There  shall be no adjustment of the Conversion Price in the case of the
issuance  of  any Capital Stock of the Company in a merger, reorganization,
acquisition,  reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction
except as  provided in this Section 8.

 

 

(d) The  Company may, from time to time, reduce the Conversion Price by any
amount  for  any period of time if the period is at least twenty (20) days
or any longer  period required by law and if the reduction is irrevocable
during the period,  but the Conversion Price may not be less than the par
value of Common Stock. 

 

 

(e) In  any  case in which this Section 8 requires that an adjustment as a
result of any  event become effective from and after a record date, the
Company may elect  to  defer until after the occurrence of that event (a)
issuing to the holder of  Preferred Stock converted after that record date
and before the occurrence  of  that event the additional shares of Common
Stock issuable upon that conversion  over and above the shares issuable on
the basis of the Conversion Price in  effect immediately before adjustment
and (b) paying to that holder any  amount in cash in lieu of a fractional
share of Common Stock.

 

 

(f) The  Company shall, as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an
event  that  requires an adjustment in the Conversion Price, provide written
notice to  the  holders of Preferred Stock of the occurrence of that event.
The Company shall  deliver a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the
method by which  the  adjustment to the Conversion Price was determined and
setting forth the revised  Conversion Price.

 

 

(g) If  the  Company shall declare a dividend or any distribution of cash,
securities  or  other property in respect of its Common Stock (other than
(x) a dividend  pursuant to Section 3(a) above, (y) a quarterly dividend on
shares of its  Common  Stock or (z) any event that requires an adjustment in
the Conversion Price),  including without limitation any granting of rights
or warrants to subscribe  for  or purchase any Capital Stock of the Company
or any Subsidiary, then the  Company  shall deliver to each holder of
Preferred Stock a written notice setting  forth  in reasonable detail the
material terms of such dividend or distribution,  at  least twenty (20) days
prior to the applicable record date on which a person  would need to hold
Common Stock in order to participate in such dividend  or  distribution.

 

 

(h) The  Company's obligations under the Certificate are subject to
applicable federal  and state securities laws.

 

 

(i) The  Board  of Directors shall have the power to resolve any ambiguity
or, subject to  applicable law, correct any error in this Section 8 and its
action in so  doing  shall be final and conclusive.

 

 

SECTION  9. _Payment  Restrictions_.  If the  Company does not pay a
dividend on a Dividend Payment Date, then, until all  accumulated dividends
have been declared and paid or declared and set apart  for  payment:

 

 

(a) the  Company may not take any of the following actions with respect to
any of  its  Junior Stock: (i) declare or pay any dividend or make any
distribution of  assets  on any Junior Stock, except that the Company may
pay dividends in shares  of its  Junior Stock and pay cash in lieu of
fractional shares in connection with  any  such dividends or (ii) redeem,
purchase or otherwise acquire any Junior Stock,  except that (x) the Company
may redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire Junior  Stock upon conversion or
exchange of such Junior Stock for other Junior Stock  and pay cash in lieu of
fractional shares in connection with any such conversion  or exchange and (y)
the Company may make (A) repurchases of Capital Stock  deemed  to occur upon
the exercise of stock options if such Capital Stock represents  a  portion
of the exercise price thereof (B) and repurchases of Capital Stock  deemed to
occur upon the withholding of a portion of the Capital Stock issued,  granted
or awarded to one of the Company's directors, officers or employees to 

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-6-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

pay  for  the taxes payable by such director, officer or employee upon such
issuance,  grant or award in order to satisfy, in whole or in part,
withholding tax  requirements in connection with the exercise of such
options, in accordance  with  the provisions of an option or rights plan or
program of the Company; 

 

 

(b) the  Company may not take any of the following actions with respect to
any of  its  Parity Stock: (i) declare or pay any dividend or make any
distribution of  assets  on any of its Parity Stock, except that the Company
may pay dividends on  Parity  Stock provided that the total funds to be paid
be divided among the Preferred  Stock and such Parity Stock on a pro rata
basis in proportion to the aggregate  amount of dividends accrued and unpaid
or accumulated thereon; or (ii) redeem,  purchase or otherwise acquire any
Parity Stock, except that the Company may  redeem, purchase or otherwise
acquire Parity Stock upon conversion or exchange  of such Parity Stock for
Junior Stock or other Parity Stock and pay cash in lieu  of fractional shares
in connection with any such conversion or exchange,  so long  as, in the
case of such other Parity Stock, (x) such other Parity Stock contains  terms
and conditions (including, without limitation, with respect to the  payment 
of dividends, dividend rates, liquidation preferences, voting and
representation  rights, payment restrictions, antidilution rights, change of
control rights,  covenants, remedies and conversion and redemption rights)
that are not  materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to the Company or
to the holders  of  Preferred Stock than those contained in the Parity Stock
that is converted  into  or exchanged for such other Parity Stock, (y) the
aggregate amount of the  liquidation preference of such other Parity Stock
does not exceed the aggregate  amount of the liquidation preference, plus
accrued and unpaid or accumulated  dividends, of the Parity Stock that is
converted into or exchanged for such  other Parity Stock and (z) the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock  issuable upon conversion,
redemption or exchange of such other Parity Stock  does  not exceed the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon  conversion,
redemption or exchange of the Parity Stock that is converted  into or 
exchanged for such other Parity Stock.

"),  which  is hereby incorporated in and expressly made a part of this

or endorsements  required by law, stock exchange rules, agreements to which
the Company is  subject, if any, or usage ( _provided_   that any  such
notation, legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the Company).  The
Global Preferred Certificate shall be deposited on behalf of the holders 
of  the Preferred Stock represented thereby with the Registrar, at its New
York  office, as custodian for DTC or its nominee and their respective
successors  (the " _Depository_ "),  and  registered in the name of the

and countersigned and registered by the Registrar  as  hereinafter provided.

made on the records of the Registrar and the Depository or its  nominee as
hereinafter provided.

 

 

(b) This  paragraph shall apply only to a Global Preferred Certificate

and the Registrar  shall,  in accordance with this Section, countersign and

_Agent  Members_ ")  shall  have no rights under this Certificate with
respect to any Global Preferred  Certificate held on their behalf by the
Depository or by the Registrar as  the  custodian of the Depository or under
such Global Preferred Certificate, and  the  Depository may be treated by
the Company, the Registrar and any agent of  the  Company or the Registrar
as the ab-

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-9-  

 

 

 

 

 


 

solute  owner of such Global Preferred Certificate for all purposes
whatsoever.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the
Company,  the  Registrar or any agent of the Company or the Registrar from
giving effect  to any  written certification, proxy or other authorization
furnished by the Depository  or impair, as between the Depository and its
Agent Members, the operation  of  customary practices of the Depository
governing the exercise of the rights  of a  holder of a beneficial interest
in any Global Preferred Certificate. Except  as  provided in Section 12(d),
owners of beneficial interests in a Global Preferred  Certificate will not be
entitled to receive physical delivery of certificated  Preferred Stock.

 

 

(c) (i)  Two  Officers shall sign the Global Preferred Certificate for the
Company by manual  or facsimile signature.

 

 

(ii) If  an  Officer whose signature is on a Global Preferred Certificate no
longer holds  that office at the time the Registrar countersigns the Global
Preferred  Certificate, the Global Preferred Certificate shall be valid
nevertheless. 

 

 

(iii) A  Global  Preferred Certificate shall not be valid until an
authorized signatory of  the  Registrar countersigns such Global Preferred
Certificate. The signature shall  be  conclusive evidence that the Global
Preferred Certificate has been  authenticated. Each Global Preferred
Certificate shall be dated the date  of its  authentication.

 

 

(d) The  Preferred Stock represented by a Global Preferred Certificate is
exchangeable  for certificated Preferred Stock in definitive form of like
tenor as such  Preferred Stock if (i) the Depository notifies the Company
that it is unwilling  or unable to continue as depositary for the global
securities and/or if at  any  time the Depository ceases to be a clearing
agency registered under the Exchange  Act and, in each case, a successor
depositary is not appointed by the Company  within 90 days after the date of
such notice or (ii) the Company, in its  sole  discretion at any time
determines to discontinue use of the system of book-entry  transfer through
DTC (or any successor depositary). Any Preferred Stock that  is 
exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence is exchangeable for
certificated  Preferred Stock issuable in authorized denominations and
registered in such  names as the Depository shall direct. Subject to the
foregoing and applicable  law, a Global Preferred Certificate is not
exchangeable, except for a Global  Preferred Certificate of the same
aggregate Liquidation Preferences to be  registered in the name of the
Depository or its nominee.

 

 

SECTION  13. _Transfer_.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
herein, so long as a Global  Preferred Certificate remains Outstanding and is
held by or on behalf of  the  Depository, transfers of a Global Preferred
Certificate, in whole or in part,  or  of any beneficial interest therein,
shall only be made in accordance with  this  Section 13.

 

 

(a) Except  for  transfers or exchanges made in accordance with paragraph
(b) of this Section  13,  transfers of a Global Preferred Certificate shall
be limited to transfers  of  such Global Preferred Certificate in whole, but
not in part, to nominees  of the  Depository or to a successor of the
Depository or such successor's  nominee.

 

 

(b) If  an  owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Preferred Certificate
deposited  with  the Depository or with the Registrar as custodian for the
Depository wishes  at  any time to transfer its interest in such Global
Preferred Certificate to  a  person who is eligible to take delivery thereof
in the form of a beneficial  interest in a Global Preferred Certificate, such
owner may, subject to the  rules  and procedures of the Depository, cause
the exchange of such interest for  a new  beneficial interest in the
applicable Global Preferred Certificate. Upon  receipt  by the Registrar at
its office in The City of New York of instructions from  the  holder
directing the Registrar to transfer its interest in the applicable  Global 
Preferred Certificate, such instructions to contain the name of the
transferee  and appropriate account information, then the Registrar shall
instruct the  Depository to reduce or cause to be reduced such Global
Preferred Certificate  by  the number of shares of the beneficial interest
therein to be exchanged and  to  debit or cause to be debited from the
account of the person making such transfer  the beneficial interest in the
Global Preferred Certificate that is being  transferred, and concurrently
with such reduction and debit, the Registrar  will  instruct the Depository
to increase or cause to be increased the applicable  Global Preferred
Certificate by the aggregate number of shares being exchanged  and to credit
or cause to be credited to the account of the transferee the  beneficial
interest in the Global Preferred Certificate that is being  transferred.

SECTION  14. _Amendment  of Certificate of Designations; Senior Stock and
Parity Stock_.

 

 

(a) The  Company may not amend this Certificate without the affirmative vote
or consent  of the holders of a majority of the shares of Preferred Stock
then Outstanding  (including votes or consents obtained in connection with a
tender offer or  exchange offer for the Preferred Stock), voting as a class,
and, except as  otherwise provided by applicable law, any past default or
failure to comply  with  any provision of this Certificate may not be waived
without the consent of  such  holders, voting as a class. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, however, without  the  consent of each holder affected, an
amendment or waiver may not (with respect  to  any shares of the Preferred
Stock held by a non-consenting holder): (i) alter  the voting rights with
respect to the Preferred Stock or reduce the number  of  shares of the
Preferred Stock whose holders must consent to an amendment,  supplement or
waiver, (ii) reduce the Liquidation Preference of any share  of the 
Preferred Stock or materially adversely alter the provisions with respect  to
the  redemption of the Preferred Stock, (iii) reduce the rate of or change
the  time  for payment of dividends on any share of the Preferred Stock,
(iv) waive  a  default in the payment of dividends on the Preferred Stock,
(v) make any  share  of the Preferred Stock payable in money other than
United States dollars,  (vi)  make any changes in the provisions of this
Certificate relating to waivers  of  the rights of holders to receive the
Liquidation Preference or dividends  on the  Preferred Stock, or (vii) make
any change in the foregoing amendment and  waiver  provisions.

 

 

Notwithstanding  the foregoing, without the consent of any holder, the
Company may (to the  extent  permitted by, and subject to the requirements
of, Delaware law) amend or  supplement this Certificate to cure any
ambiguity, defect or inconsistency,  to  provide for uncertificated shares
of the Preferred Stock in addition to or  in  place of certificated shares
of the Preferred Stock, to make any change that  would provide any additional
rights or benefits to the holders or to make  any  change that the Board of
Directors determines, in good faith, is not materially  adverse to holders of
the Preferred Stock.

 

 

(b) So  long as  any shares of the Preferred Stock remain Outstanding, the
Company shall not,  without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
two-thirds of the  shares  of Preferred Stock Outstanding at the time,
voting as a class, (i) issue  shares of or increase the authorized number of
shares of any Senior Stock  or  Parity Stock or (ii) amend the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation or  the resolutions contained in this
Certificate, whether by merger, consolidation  or otherwise, if the amendment
would alter or change any power, preference  or  special right of the
Outstanding Preferred Stock in any manner materially  adverse to the
interests of the holders thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  neither (x)
an increase in the authorized number of shares of Common Stock  or the
authorization and issuance of Junior Stock, including that with voting  or 
redemption rights that are different from the voting or redemption rights  of
the  Preferred Stock, nor (y) an increase, decrease or change in the par
value  of any class or series of Capital Stock, including the Preferred
Stock, shall  be  deemed to be an amendment that alters or changes such
powers, preferences  or  special rights in any manner materially adverse to
the interests of the holders  of Preferred Stock.

 

 

SECTION  15. _Paying  Agent and Conversion Agent_. 

 

 

(a) The  Company shall maintain in the City of Canton, State of Georgia, or
in such  other  City and State as the Company may from time to time
designate, (i) an office  or  agency where payments may be made with respect
to the Preferred Stock (the  " _Paying  Agent_ ")  and  (ii) an office or
agency where Preferred Stock may be presented for conversion  (the "
_Conversion  Agent_ ").  The  Company may appoint the Registrar, the Paying
Agent and the Conversion Agent  and  may appoint one or more additional
paying agents and one or more additional  conversion agents in such other
locations as it shall determine. The term  " _Paying  Agent_ " includes 
any additional paying agent and the term " _Conversion  Agent_ " includes 
any additional conversion agent. The Company may change any Paying Agent 
or  Conversion Agent without prior notice to any holder. The Company shall
notify  the Registrar of the name and address of any Paying Agent or
Conversion Agent  appointed by the Company. If the Company fails to appoint
or maintain another  entity as Paying Agent or Conversion Agent, the
Registrar shall act as such.  The  Company or any of its affiliates may act
as Paying Agent, Registrar,  co-Registrar or Conversion Agent.

 

 

(b) Neither  the Company nor the Registrar shall be required (i) to issue,
countersign  or  register the transfer of or exchange of any Preferred Stock
during a period  beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the date
of the mailing  of a  notice of redemption of Preferred Stock under Section
5 and ending at the  close  of busi-

ness  on  the date of such mailing or (ii) to register the transfer of or
exchange  of any  Preferred Stock so selected for redemption in whole or in
part, except the  unredeemed portion of any Preferred Stock being redeemed in
part.

 

 

(c) Payments  made with respect to the Preferred Stock shall be payable at
the office or  agency of the Company maintained for such purpose in the City
of Canton,  State  of Georgia, or in such other City and State as the
Company may from time  to time  designate. Payments shall be payable by
United States dollar check drawn  on, or  wire transfer ( _provided_ , 
that  appropriate wire instructions have been received by the Paying Agent
or  Registrar at least 15 days prior to the applicable date of payment) to
a  U.S.  dollar account maintained by the holder with, a bank located in New
York  City;  _provided_   that at  the option of the Company, payment of
dividends may be made by check mailed  to  the address of the person
entitled thereto as such address shall appear in  the  Preferred Stock
register.

 

 

(d) Any  payment, redemption, conversion or exchange with respect to the
Preferred  Stock  due on any date that is not a Business Day need not be
made on such Business  Day, but may be made on the next succeeding Business
Day with the same force  and  effect as if made on such due date.

 

 

SECTION  16. _General_. 

 

 

(a) The  headings of the Sections of this Certificate are for convenience of
reference  only and shall not define, limit or affect any of the provisions 
hereof.

 

 

(b) Procedures  for conversion of shares of Preferred Stock, in accordance
with Section 7,  not  held in certificated form will be governed by
arrangements among the depositary  of the shares of Preferred Stock, its
participants and persons that may hold  beneficial interests through such
participants designed to permit settlement  without the physical movement of
certificates. Payments, transfers, deliveries,  exchanges and other matters
relating to beneficial interests in global security  certificates may be
subject to various policies and procedures adopted by  the  depositary from
time to time.

 

 

(c) Holders  of  the Preferred Stock are not entitled to any preemptive or
subscription rights  in  respect of any securities of the Company.

 

 

(d) Whenever  possible, each provision hereof shall be interpreted in a
manner as to be  effective and valid under applicable law, but if any
provision hereof is  held to  be prohibited by or invalid under applicable
law, such provision shall be  ineffective only to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without  invalidating or otherwise adversely
affecting the remaining provisions hereof.  If a court of competent
jurisdiction should determine that a provision hereof  would be valid or
enforceable if a period of time were extended or shortened  or  a particular
percentage were increased or decreased, then such court may  make  such
change as shall be necessary to render the provision in question effective 
and valid under applicable law.

 

 

(e) Subject  to  applicable escheat laws, any monies set aside by the
Company in respect of  any  payment with respect to shares of the Preferred
Stock, or dividends thereon,  and  unclaimed at the end of two years from
the date upon which such payment is  due  and payable shall revert to the
general funds of the Company, after which  reversion the holders of such
shares shall look only to the general funds  of the  Company for the payment
thereof. Any interest accrued on funds so deposited  shall be paid to the
Company from time to time.

EXHIBIT  B

 

 

_Form  of  Affiliate Letter_

 

 

Ladies  and  Gentlemen:

 

 

The  undersigned refers to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " _Merger 
Agreement_ "),  dated  as of December 20, 2006, by and among Davis
Acquisition Sub LLC a Delaware  limited liability company (" _NHC/OP  Sub_
"),  NHC/OP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and the direct parent of
NHC/OP  Sub  (" _NHC/OP_ "),  National HealthCare Corporation, a Delaware
corporation and the ultimate  parent  of NHC/OP (" _Parent_ "),  and 
National Health Realty, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the " _Company_ "). 
Capitalized terms used but not defined in this letter have the meanings
given  such terms in the Merger Agreement.

 

 

The  undersigned, a holder of shares of Company Common Stock, is entitled to
receive  in connection with the Merger shares of Parent's Series A
Convertible  Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the " _Parent 
Preferred Stock_ ").  The  undersigned acknowledges that the undersigned may
be deemed an "affiliate" of  the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 ("
_Rule  145_ ")  promulgated under the Securities Act, although nothing
contained herein should  be construed as an admission of such fact.

 

 

If  in fact  the undersigned were an affiliate under the Securities Act, the
undersigned's  ability to sell, assign or transfer the Parent Preferred Stock
received by  the  undersigned in exchange for any shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to  the  Merger may be restricted unless such sale,
assignment or transfer is registered  under the Securities Act or an
exemption from such registration is available.  The undersigned (i)
understands that such exemptions are limited and  (ii) has obtained advice of
counsel as to the nature and conditions of such  exemptions, including
information with respect to the applicability to the  sale  of such
securities of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the Securities  Act. 
The undersigned understands that Parent will not be required to maintain 
the  effectiveness of any registration statement under the Securities Act
for  purposes of resale of Parent Preferred Stock by the undersigned.

 

 

The  undersigned hereby represents to and covenants with Parent that the
undersigned  will not sell, assign or transfer any of the Parent Preferred
Stock received  by  the undersigned in exchange for shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to  the  Merger except (i) pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the  Securities Act, (ii) in conformity with the
volume and other limitations of  Rule 144 or (iii) in a transaction that, in
the opinion of counsel to  Parent or other counsel reasonably satisfactory to
Parent or as described  in a "no-action" or interpretive letter from the
staff of the SEC specifically issued  with respect to a transaction to be
engaged in by the undersigned, is not  required to be registered under the
Securities Act.

 

 

In  the  event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned pursuant to
Rule  145(d)  of Parent Preferred Stock, the undersigned will supply Parent
with evidence  of  compliance with such Rule, in the form of a letter in the
form of _Annex  I_   hereto  and the opinion of counsel or no-action letter
referred to above. The  undersigned understands that Parent may instruct its
transfer agent to withhold  the transfer of any Parent Preferred Stock
disposed of by the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

undersigned,  but that upon receipt of such evidence of compliance Parent
shall cause the  transfer agent to effectuate the transfer of the Parent
Preferred Stock sold  as  indicated in the letter.

 

 

The  undersigned acknowledges and agrees that the legend set forth below
will  be  placed on certificates representing Parent Preferred Stock
received by the  undersigned in connection with the Merger or held by a
transferee thereof,  which  legend will be removed by delivery of substitute
certificates upon receipt  of an  opinion in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent from independent  counsel reasonably satisfactory to
Parent to the effect that such legend  is no  longer required for purposes
of the Securities Act.

 

 

"THE  SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO
WHICH  RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 APPLIES. THE
SHARES  HAVE  NOT BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE HOLDER WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE
IN CONNECTION  WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE
SECURITIES ACT OF  1933.  THE SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED EXCEPT IN  ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENTS OF THE  SECURITIES ACT OF 1933."

 

 

The  undersigned acknowledges that (i) the undersigned has carefully read
this  letter and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations
imposed  upon  the distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of
Parent Preferred  Stock  and (ii) the receipt by Parent of this letter is an
inducement and a  condition to Parent's obligations to consummate the Merger.

 

 

This  Agreement shall only become effective as of the Effective Time of the 
Merger.

 

 

 

Very  truly  yours,

 

 

Dated:  [ ]

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 


 

_ANNEX  I_

 

 

[Name]

 

 

On  [ ], the  undersigned sold the securities of National HealthCare
Corporation  (" _NHC_ ")  described below in the space provided for that
purpose (the " _Securities_ ").  The  Securities were received by the
undersigned in connection with the merger  of  National Health Realty, Inc.,
a Maryland corporation, with and into Davis  Acquisition Sub LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company and an indirect  wholly-owned subsidiary of NHC.

 

 

Based  upon  the most recent report or statement filed by NHC with the
Securities and  Exchange Commission, the Securities sold by the undersigned
were within the  prescribed limitations set forth in paragraph (e) of Rule
144 promulgated  under  the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities  Act_ ").

 

 

The  undersigned represents that the Securities were sold in "brokers
transactions," within the meaning of Section 4(4) of the Securities Act, or
in transactions  with a "market maker," as that term is defined in Section
3(a)(38) of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The undersigned
further represents  that the undersigned has not solicited or arranged for
the solicitation of  orders to buy the Securities, and that the undersigned
has not made any payment  in connection with the offer or sale of the
Securities to any person other  than  to the broker who executed the order
in respect of such sale.

 

 

 

Very  truly  yours,

 

 

[Space  to be provided for description of the Securities]
