 Section 2.01. Estimated Purchase Price. At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Buyer the Companys good faith estimate, on a reasonable basis using the Companys then available financial information, of the Purchase Price (such estimate is referred to as the " _Estimated Purchase Price_ ") and the initial Securityholder Allocation Percentage for each Securityholder. The Estimated Purchase Price, and each component thereof, shall be determined on a consolidated basis using the same accounting methods, policies, principles, practices and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and estimation methodology, as were used in preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet or, to the extent applicable, in accordance with any changes to such accounting methods, policies, principles, practices and procedures which are documented in the Companys books and records prior to the Closing. The amount of the Estimated Purchase Price payable to each Securityholder is set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto, which exhibit may be updated and delivered to the Buyer in connection with the deliveries to be made pursuant to this _Section 2.01_. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Purchase Price_ " means an amount equal to: 

  

 (a) $250,000,000, 

   

 (b) plus the Cash Amount, 

   

 (c) plus the Payables Amount, 

   

 (d) minus the Indebtedness Amount, 

    ##### 

  

     

 (e) plus the Transaction Tax Benefit Amount, 

   

 (f) (i) plus the excess of the Net Working Capital Amount over the Target Working Capital Amount, if any, or (ii) minus the excess of the Target Working Capital Amount over the Net Working Capital Amount, 

   

 (g) minus the amount of the Transaction Expenses, 

   

 (h) plus the amount of the Antitrust Approval Fees. 

   

 Section 2.02. Purchase and Sale of the Shares; Payment of Options. 

  

 (a) _Purchase and Sale of Shares_. As of the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each Stockholder shall sell, assign, transfer and convey to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase and acquire from each such Stockholder, all of the Shares held by such Stockholder. Subject to _Section 2.04_, the purchase price to be paid by the Buyer to each Stockholder for the Shares held by such Stockholder shall consist of a payment at the Closing, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such Stockholder set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto (as the same may be updated prior to Closing), of an amount of cash equal to the result of (A) the Estimated Purchase Price multiplied by such Stockholders Securityholder Allocation Percentage, minus (C) the Initial Reserve Amount multiplied by such Stockholders Securityholder Allocation Percentage (with respect to a Stockholder, such Stockholders " _Stockholder Closing Payment Amount_ "). 

   

 (b) _Cash Out of the Options_. As of the Closing and simultaneously with the payment to the Stockholders of the Stockholder Closing Payment Amounts, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (including _Section 2.04_), the Buyer shall pay, or irrevocably cause the Company to pay (by providing funds to the Company or otherwise), to each Optionholder, in cancellation of such Optionholders Options, an amount in cash equal to the excess of (i) the result of (A) the Estimated Purchase Price multiplied by such Optionholders Securityholder Allocation Percentage, _minus_ (B) the Initial Reserve Amount multiplied by such Optionholders Securityholder Allocation Percentage, over (ii) the aggregate exercise price such Optionholder would have paid if such Optionholder had exercised all such Options immediately prior to the Closing (with respect to an Optionholder, such Optionholders " _Optionholder Closing Payment Amount_ "), less all applicable withholding Taxes. Each Optionholder agrees that he or she will not exercise his or her Option at or prior to the Closing, and that upon the payment by the Company or the Buyer to such Optionholder of the Optionholder Closing Payment Amount, less all applicable withholding Taxes, the Options held by such Optionholder will be cancelled and of no further force and effect. 

   

 Section 2.03. The Closing. 

  

 (a) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Patton Boggs LLP (" _PB_ ") in Dallas, Texas, at 10:00 a.m. on the third (3rd) Business Day following full satisfaction or due waiver of all of the closing conditions set forth in _Article 9_ hereof (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing) or on such other date as is mutually agreeable to the Buyer and Securityholder Representative. The date of the Closing is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto shall consummate the following transactions as of the Closing: 

    

 (i) each Stockholder shall deliver to the Buyer all of the stock certificates representing the Shares held by such Stockholder duly endorsed for transfer or accompanied by duly executed stock powers (or other form of assignment or transfer) or a duly executed lost stock affidavit in a form reasonably acceptable to the Buyer and the Company; 

   

 (ii) the Buyer shall deliver to each Stockholder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by such Stockholder, cash in an amount equal to such Stockholders Stockholder Closing Payment Amount; 

   

 (iii) the Buyer shall pay to each such Optionholder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by such Optionholder, an amount equal to such Optionholders Optionholder Closing Payment Amount, less all applicable withholding Taxes; 

   

 (iv) the Buyer shall deliver to the Securityholder Representative, for the benefit of the Securityholders in accordance with their respective Securityholder Allocation Percentages, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Reserve Account, cash in an amount equal to the Initial Reserve Amount; 

   

 (v) the Buyer shall pay on behalf of the Company and the Subsidiaries, all Indebtedness of the Company and the Subsidiaries set forth on _Schedule 2.03(b)(v)_ hereto in accordance with the payoff letters and other payment instructions provided by the Company or the Securityholder Representative; 

   

 (vi) the Buyer shall pay on behalf of the Company and the Securityholders, the Transaction Expenses set forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto; and 

   

 (vii) the Buyer, the Company and the Securityholders shall make such other deliveries as are required by and in accordance with _Article 9_ hereof. 

  

 Section 2.04. Post-Closing Adjustment. 

  

 (a) _Post-Closing Determination_. Within forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, the Buyer and its auditors shall prepare and deliver to the Securityholder Representative (i) the Buyers determinations of the Cash Amount, the Indebtedness Amount, and the Net Working Capital Amount, and (ii) the Buyers calculation of the Purchase Price (collectively, the " _Draft Computation_ "). The Draft Computation shall be prepared and the Cash Amount, the Indebtedness Amount, and the Net Working Capital Amount shall be determined on a consolidated basis using the same accounting methods, policies, principles, practices and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and estimation methodology, as were used in preparation of the Latest Balance Sheet or, to the extent applicable, in accordance with any changes to such accounting methods, policies, principles, practices and procedures which are documented in the Companys books and records prior to the Closing, and shall not include any changes in assets or liabilities as a result of purchase or other non-cash accounting adjustments 

     ##### 

  

    

or other changes arising from or resulting as a consequence of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The parties agree that the purpose of
preparing the Draft Computation and determining the Cash Amount, the
Indebtedness Amount, and the Net Working Capital Amount and the related
purchase price adjustment contemplated by this _Section 2.04_ is to measure
the amount of Cash and Indebtedness and changes in Net Working Capital, and
such processes are not intended to permit the introduction of
different judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies for the purpose of
preparing the Draft Computation or determining Cash, Indebtedness or Net
Working Capital. The Company and its auditors will make available to the
Buyer and its auditors, employees and advisors all records and work papers
used in preparing the Estimated Purchase Price. The Buyer and its auditors
will make available to the Securityholder Representative and its auditors,
employees and advisors all records and work papers used in preparing the
Draft Computation and will prepare and deliver to the Securityholder
Representative a detailed analysis of the changes behind any material
variance(s) between the Buyers determination of the Cash Amount, the
Indebtedness Amount and the Net Working Capital Amount, and the corresponding
estimates of such amounts as determined by the Company pursuant to
_Section 2.01_ hereof. If the Securityholder Representative disagrees with
any aspect of the Draft Computation, the Securityholder Representative may,
within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Draft Computation, deliver a
notice (an " _Objection Notice_ ") to the Buyer setting forth the
Securityholder Representatives determination of the Cash Amount, the
Indebtedness Amount, and/or the Net Working Capital Amount and the
Securityholder Representatives calculation of the Purchase Price. If the
Securityholder Representative does not deliver an Objection Notice to
the Buyer within forty-five (45) days after receipt of the Draft Computation,
then the parties hereto will be deemed to have agreed to the Draft
Computation and the components of such Draft Computation shall be deemed to
be finally determined as set forth therein. The Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative shall use reasonable efforts to resolve any
disagreements as to the Draft Computation and the Objection Notice, but if
they do not obtain a final resolution within forty-five (45) days after the
Buyer has received the Objection Notice, the Buyer and the Securityholder
Representative shall jointly retain Grant Thornton LLP or such other
accounting firm acceptable to the Buyer and the Securityholder Representative
(the " _Firm_ ") to resolve any remaining disagreements. The Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative shall direct the Firm to render a determination
within thirty (30) days after its retention and the Buyer, the Securityholder
Representative and their respective agents shall cooperate with the Firm
during its engagement. The Firm will act as an expert and not as an
arbitrator in conducting its analysis and may consider only those items and
amounts in the Draft Computation or Objection Notice which the Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative are unable to resolve. In resolving any disputed
item, the Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party. The Firms determination shall be
based solely on written submissions by the Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative (i.e., not on independent review) and on the
definitions included herein. The determination of the Firm shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Buyer, the Securityholder Representative and
the Securityholders. Until the Firm makes its determination, the costs
and expenses of the Firm shall be borne equally by the Buyer, on the one
hand, and the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders
in accordance with their respective Securityholder Allocation Percentages),
on the other hand; _provided_ , _that_ when the Firm makes its determination,
any costs and expenses (including costs and expenses 

    ##### 

  

    

previously advanced) shall be allocated between the Securityholder
Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders in accordance with their
respective Securityholder Allocation Percentages), on the one hand, and the
Buyer, on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually
contested by such party. For example, if the Securityholder Representative
claims the Net Working Capital Amount is $1,000 greater than the amount
determined by the Buyer, and the Buyer contests only $500 of the amount
claimed by the Securityholder Representative, and if the Firm ultimately
resolves the dispute by awarding the Securityholders $300 of the $500
contested, then the costs and expenses of the Firm will be allocated 60%
(i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to the Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to the
Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders in accordance
with their respective Securityholder Allocation Percentages). 

   

 (b) _Post-Closing Adjustment_. 

    

 (i) _Payment by the Buyer_. If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_ exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price by more than $250,000, then within five (5) Business Days after such final determination, the Buyer shall pay to the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders in accordance with their respective Securityholder Allocation Percentages), by wire transfer or delivery of other immediately available funds, an amount equal to the amount by which such excess exceeds $250,000; _provided_ , _however_ , _that_ in lieu of any distribution of such amount to the Securityholders, the Securityholder Representative, in its sole discretion, may retain all or any portion of such amounts as part of the Reserve Account. 

   

 (ii) _Payment by the Securityholders_. If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.04(a)_ is less than the Estimated Purchase Price, then within five (5) Business Days after the determination thereof, the Securityholder Representative shall pay to the Buyer from the Reserve Account an amount equal to the amount by which such excess exceeds $250,000 (the amount of such excess, the " _Securityholder Working Capital Payment_ ") and, in the event that the Reserve Account is insufficient to pay the full amount of the Securityholder Working Capital Payment, then each Securityholder shall promptly pay to Buyer by wire transfer or delivery of other immediately available funds, an amount equal to (i) the unpaid portion of the Securityholder Working Capital Payment _multiplied by_ (ii) such Securityholders Securityholder Allocation Percentage. 

  

 Section 2.05. Reserve Account. At Closing, the Securityholder Representative shall retain from the Estimated Purchase Price the sum of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the " _Initial Reserve Amount_ ") for deposit into a bank account controlled by the Securityholder Representative (together with any amount retained by the Securityholder Representative pursuant to  _Section 2.04(b)(i)_, the " _Reserve Account_ "). All amounts on deposit in the Reserve Account, including any earnings thereon, shall be available to the Securityholder Representative to cover costs and expenses incurred by the Securityholder Representative in the performance of its obligations as Securityholder Representative, including, without limitation, costs and expenses, if any, incurred by the Securityholder Representative (i) in resolving any adjustments pursuant to  _Section 2.04_, (ii) in defending any indemnification claims brought under _Article 11_ hereof, and (iii) in paying any amounts (including fees, costs and expenses) otherwise payable by the 

   ##### 

  

 

Securityholders to the Buyer or the Securityholder Representative pursuant to
the terms hereof. Amounts in the Reserve Account may also be applied by the
Securityholder Representative as permitted in accordance with _Section
11.04_.

and records or any portion thereof which the Buyer, the Company or any

The Buyer shall cause the Company and each Subsidiary, at the Companys sole cost and expense, to maintain its existing officers and directors liability insurance, or other liability insurance that covers events occurring prior to the Closing on terms and in amounts no less favorable to the Indemnified Representatives than its existing officers and directors liability insurance for a period of six (6) years after the Closing.

by the Company under this  _Section 7.04_. If the Company or any Subsidiary
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with
or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then,
and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Company or each Subsidiary shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.04_. The provisions of this 
_Section 7.04_ are intended for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Representative and his or her heirs and representatives, and
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have had by contract
or otherwise. The Buyer and the Company acknowledge and agree that, to the
extent that an Indemnified Representative is entitled to be indemnified by
the Company or any Subsidiary as contemplated by this _Section 7.04_ and by
any Securityholder or any Affiliate of any such Securityholder (other than
the Company or any Subsidiary) under any other agreement or instrument, or by
any insurer under a policy maintained by any such Securityholder or Affiliate,
(i) the obligations of the Company hereunder shall be primary, and the
obligations of such Securityholder, Affiliate or insurer secondary, (ii) the
Indemnified Representative shall proceed first against the Company and any
insurer under any policy maintained by the Company, and second, if
indemnification is not provided by the Company or any such insurer on a
timely basis, against any insurer under a policy maintained by any such
Securityholder or Affiliate, (iii) the Company shall be required to advance
the full amount of expenses incurred by any Indemnified Representative and
shall be liable for the full amount of all expenses, judgments, penalties,
fines and amounts paid in settlement to the extent legally permitted and as
required by the terms of this Agreement, and (iv) the Company shall not be
entitled to contribution or indemnification from or subrogation against any
such Securityholder, Affiliate or insurer under a policy maintained by any
such Securityholder or Affiliate. In the event that any such Securityholder
or Affiliate makes indemnification payments or advances to the Indemnified
Representative in respect of any Losses (including all interest, assessments
and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any such
Losses) for which the Company would also be obligated as contemplated by this
Agreement, the Company shall indemnify, reimburse and hold harmless such
Securityholder or Affiliate in full on demand.

For purposes hereof, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean any refund of Taxes paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise would have been paid, in each case computed at the effective tax rates. The Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiaries shall seek full recovery of any Loss from all Collateral Sources covering such Loss to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. The Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiaries shall not terminate or cancel any insurance policies in effect for periods prior to the Closing. In the event that a recovery from a Collateral Source is made by the Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery (net of all direct collection expenses) shall be made promptly to the Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders in accordance with their respective Securityholder Allocation Percentages). The Indemnitors shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitees in respect of any Losses indemnified by the Indemnitors.

The appointment of the Securityholder Representative is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable by any Securityholder in any manner or for any reason. This power of attorney shall not be affected by the death, illness, dissolution, disability, incapacity or other inability to act of the principal pursuant to any applicable Law. 

   

 (d) The Securityholder Representative may resign from its capacity as Securityholder Representative at any time by written notice delivered to the Buyer and the Securityholders. If there is a vacancy at any time in the position of Securityholder Representative for any reason, 

     ##### 

 

   

such vacancy shall be filled by a Securityholders vote in the form of a
writing executed by the Securityholders entitled to a majority of the number
of votes referred to in the next sentence. In such event, each Securityholder
shall have a number of votes equal to such Securityholders Securityholder
Allocation Percentage multiplied by 100 and the authorization of a majority of
such number of votes shall be binding on all of the Securityholders and shall
constitute the authorization of the Securityholders. 

  

 (e) The Securityholder Representative shall not be liable to the Buyer or the Securityholders in its capacity as the Securityholder Representative for any liability of a Securityholder or for any error of judgment, or any act done or step taken or omitted by it believed by it to be in good faith or for any mistake in fact or law, or for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in connection with this Agreement except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct by it. The Securityholder Representative may seek the advice of reputable legal counsel in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any of the provisions of this Agreement or its duties hereunder, and it shall incur no liability in its capacity as Securityholder Representative to the Buyer or the Securityholders and shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken, omitted or suffered by it in good faith in accordance with the opinion of such counsel.

 Section 12.03. Construction; Severability. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Person. The headings of the sections and paragraphs of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way restrict or otherwise modify any of the terms or provisions hereof. In the event a subject matter is addressed in more than one representation and warranty in _Article 3_, the Buyer shall be entitled to rely only on the most specific representation and warranty addressing such subject matter. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but, if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable Law, then such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Agreement to $ or dollars are to U.S. dollars. 

  

 Section 12.04. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, and subject to _Section 11.04_ , each party shall pay all of its own fees, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel, investment bankers, brokers or other representatives and consultants and appraisal fees, costs and expenses) incurred in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby, the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; _provided_ , _that_ the Buyer shall pay any and all expenses relating to surveys, title insurance, and any other filings and consents required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and _provided_ , _further_ ,  _that_ all fees payable by the Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary or the Securityholders in connection with the Antitrust Approvals shall be paid by the Buyer. 

  

 Section 12.05. Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns;  _provided_ , _that_ no party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party hereto, except (i) that Buyer may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate (an " _Assignee_ ") provided that Buyer remains liable for the obligations, representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Assignee hereunder, and (ii) that following the Closing, the Securityholder Representative may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights to one or more of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon notice to the Securityholder Representative, the Buyer may assign any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any lender to the Buyer as security for indebtedness to any such lender with respect to a financing arrangement in connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement. 

  

 Section 12.06. Governing Law. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and the exhibits and Schedules hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the 

   ##### 

  

    

State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 

  

 Section 12.07. Arbitration. 

 

 (a) Except for the matters set forth in _Section 2.04(a)_ and the rights of the parties to equitable relief pursuant to _Section 12.10_, any dispute, controversy, or claim under, arising out of, or relating in any way to this Agreement and/or the negotiation, inducement, validity, interpretation, or breach thereof shall be resolved solely and exclusively by binding arbitration. Such arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect at the time a demand for arbitration is made, and the provisions of this Section. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Section and the Commercial Arbitration Rules, the provisions of this Section shall govern.

  

 (b) Any dispute, controversy, or claim shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Section upon the filing with the Washington, D.C. office of the American Arbitration Association and delivery to the parties hereto of a written demand for arbitration, which demand shall describe in reasonable detail the facts and legal grounds forming the basis for the claim and any request for relief. The arbitration shall be conducted before a panel of three (3) arbitrators (the " _Panel_ ") who are mutually agreeable to the parties. If the parties cannot mutually agree upon the selection of an arbitrator, the arbitrator shall be selected in accordance with the rules of the then-effective Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be held in New York, New York, or at another location if agreed to by all parties.

  

 (c) The arbitration hearing shall commence within one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days of the selection of the arbitrator and shall proceed and be completed expeditiously thereafter.

  

 (d) Unless otherwise ordered by the Panel upon application by a party and good cause shown by such party, discovery for each party shall be limited to fifteen (15) interrogatories, twenty-five (25) requests for production of documents, and three (3) depositions. All issues concerning discovery (including the scope of discovery) upon which the parties cannot agree shall be submitted to the arbitrator for determination.

  

 (e) Each party shall identify, no less than twenty (20) business days before the date of the commencement of the arbitration hearing, all persons that may testify at the arbitration hearing, all exhibits to be introduced into evidence at the arbitration hearing, and all documents considered, used, or relied upon by any witness in support of or in connection with that witness testimony at the arbitration hearing.

  

 (f) In rendering an award, the arbitrator shall determine the rights and obligations of the parties according to the laws of the State of Delaware, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section.

  

 (g) The arbitrators decision and award shall be made in writing and shall be issued in a final, confirmable form no more than forty-five (45) calendar days after the commencement of the arbitration hearing. The arbitrator shall not have the power to award damages that are

   ##### 

  

    

specifically excluded under this Agreement, and each party hereby irrevocably
waives any claim to such damages. The decision and award of the arbitrator
shall be final and binding on the parties and shall not be subject to appeal.
Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction thereof. 

  

 (h) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Sections 11.02(a)_ and _(b)_ , and subject to _Section 11.04_, each party shall bear its own costs and fees in connection with any arbitration conducted pursuant to this _Section 12.07_ and any proceedings in connection therewith.

  

 (i) Any party unsuccessfully refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrator shall be liable for costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by the other party in enforcing the order.

   

 Section 12.08. Forum. Except for the dispute resolution procedures otherwise set forth in  _Section 2.04(a)_ and the rights of the parties to seek equitable relief pursuant to  _Section 12.10_, each party agrees that any suit, action or proceeding brought by such party against the other in connection with or arising from this Agreement shall be subject to the arbitration provisions set forth in _Section 12.07_. Any equitable remedies sought in connection with this Agreement (" _Judicial Action_ ") shall be brought against any of the parties only in any United States federal or state court located in the State of Delaware and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Judicial Action and waives any objection to venue laid therein. Process in any such Judicial Action proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the State of Delaware. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees that service of process upon such party at the address referred to in _Section 12.01_, together with written notice of such service to such party, shall be deemed effective service of process upon such party. 

  

 Section 12.09. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT TO ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 12.09_. 

  

 Section 12.10. Specific Performance. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the rights of each party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique and recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching party may have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the parties agree that such non-breaching party shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor at law or in equity, to enforce their rights 

   ##### 

  

    

and the other partys obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions
for damages but also by an action or actions for specific performance,
injunctive and/or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other
security). 

  

 Section 12.11. Prevailing Party. If any litigation or other court action, arbitration or similar adjudicatory proceeding is commenced by any party hereto to enforce its rights under this Agreement against any other party, all fees, costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and court costs, incurred by the prevailing party in such litigation, action, arbitration or proceeding shall be reimbursed by the losing party; _provided_ ,  _that_ if a party to such litigation, action, arbitration or proceeding prevails in part, and loses in part, then the court, arbitrator or other adjudicator presiding over such litigation, action, arbitration or proceeding shall award a reimbursement of the fees, costs and expenses incurred by such party on an equitable basis. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing sentence shall not apply to any fees, costs or expenses in connection with _Section 2.04(a)_ or as contemplated by _Section 12.07(h)_. 

  

 Section 12.12. Counterparts; Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other parties hereto. Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein (including specifically, but not limited to, the Persons not party hereto entitled to the benefits of _Sections 7.04_, _8.06_ ,  _11.01_ , _11.02_ and _11.03_ ), no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. 

  

 Section 12.13. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the documents referred to herein (including the Confidentiality Agreement) contain the complete agreement between the parties hereto and supersede any other prior understandings, agreements, representations or warranties by or between the parties, written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any way. 

  

 Section 12.14. Termination of Agreements. Each Securityholder (other than ACAS for the sole purpose of the enforcement by ACAS of the provisions thereof prior to the Closing), to the extent a party thereto, agrees that the Stockholders Agreement and that certain Agreement dated October 14, 2005 between the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and ACAS, on the other hand (together, the " _Terminating Agreements_ ") shall be of no further force or effect from and after the Closing, and hereby waives any and all (i) notice requirements and (ii) rights or restrictions with respect to the transfer of the shares of Common Stock of the Company set forth in the Stockholders Agreement. Each Securityholder (other than ACAS for the sole purpose of the enforcement by ACAS of the provisions thereof prior to the Closing), to the extent a party thereto, hereby waives any and all rights under the Terminating Agreements, and, except for the continuing obligations provided for herein, releases all other parties to the Terminating Agreements from all obligations, commitments, liabilities or claims arising thereunder.
