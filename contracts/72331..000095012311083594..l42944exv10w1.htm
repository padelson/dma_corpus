purpose of preparing the Draft Computation and determining the Cash Amount, the Indebtedness
Amount, and the Net Working Capital Amount and the related purchase price adjustment contemplated
by this <U>Section&nbsp;2.04</U> is to measure the amount of Cash and Indebtedness and changes in Net
Working Capital, and such processes are not intended to permit the introduction of different
judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or
estimation methodologies for the purpose of preparing the Draft Computation or determining Cash,
Indebtedness or Net Working Capital. The Company and its auditors will make available to the Buyer
and its auditors, employees and advisors all records and work papers used in preparing the
Estimated Purchase Price. The Buyer and its auditors will make available to the Securityholder
Representative and its auditors, employees and advisors all records and work papers used in
preparing the Draft Computation and will prepare and deliver to the Securityholder Representative a
detailed analysis of the changes behind any material variance(s) between the Buyer&#146;s determination
of the Cash Amount, the Indebtedness Amount and the Net Working Capital Amount, and the
corresponding estimates of such amounts as determined by the Company pursuant to <U>Section
2.01</U> hereof. If the Securityholder Representative disagrees with any aspect of the Draft
Computation, the Securityholder Representative may, within forty-five (45)&nbsp;days after receipt of
the Draft Computation, deliver a notice (an &#147;<U>Objection Notice</U>&#148;) to the Buyer setting forth
the Securityholder Representative&#146;s determination of the Cash Amount, the Indebtedness Amount,
and/or the Net Working Capital Amount and the Securityholder Representative&#146;s calculation of the
Purchase Price. If the Securityholder Representative does not deliver an Objection Notice to the
Buyer within forty-five (45)&nbsp;days after receipt of the Draft Computation, then the parties hereto
will be deemed to have agreed to the Draft Computation and the components of such Draft Computation
shall be deemed to be finally determined as set forth therein. The Buyer and the Securityholder
Representative shall use reasonable efforts to resolve any disagreements as to the Draft
Computation and the Objection Notice, but if they do not obtain a final resolution within
forty-five (45)&nbsp;days after the Buyer has received the Objection Notice, the Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative shall jointly retain Grant Thornton LLP or such other accounting firm
acceptable to the Buyer and the Securityholder Representative (the &#147;<U>Firm</U>&#148;) to resolve any
remaining disagreements. The Buyer and the Securityholder Representative shall direct the Firm to
render a determination within thirty (30)&nbsp;days after its retention and the Buyer, the
Securityholder Representative and their respective agents shall cooperate with the Firm during its
engagement. The Firm will act as an expert and not as an arbitrator in conducting its analysis and
may consider only those items and amounts in the Draft Computation or Objection Notice which the
Buyer and the Securityholder Representative are unable to resolve. In resolving any disputed item,
the Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed
by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The Firm&#146;s
determination shall be based solely on written submissions by the Buyer and the Securityholder
Representative (i.e., not on independent review) and on the definitions included herein. The
determination of the Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the Buyer, the Securityholder
Representative and the Securityholders. Until the Firm makes its determination, the costs and
expenses of the Firm shall be borne equally by the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Securityholder
Representative (on behalf of the Securityholders in accordance with their respective Securityholder
Allocation Percentages), on the other hand; <U>provided</U>, <U>that</U> when the Firm makes its

Securityholder Representative, and if the Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding the
