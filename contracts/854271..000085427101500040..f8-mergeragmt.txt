Corporation"), shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the
State of Texas. The Merger shall have the effects specified in this
Agreement, the DGCL and the TBCA.   2.3 Governing Instruments, Directors and
Officers of the Surviving Corporation.   (a) The articles of incorporation
of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until duly amended
in accordance with their terms and applicable law.   (b) The bylaws of
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be

their terms and applicable law.   (c) The directors and officers of Merger
Sub at the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers, respectively,
of the Surviving Corporation from the Effective Time until their respective
successors have been duly elected or appointed in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation and
applicable law.   2.4 Effect on Securities.   (a) Merger Sub Stock. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any holder thereof, each share of Merger Sub Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and continue
as one share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation and each
certificate evidencing ownership of any   12    such shares shall
continue to evidence ownership of the same number of shares of the capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Parent Capital Stock. At the
Effective Time, each share of Parent capital stock then issued and
outstanding shall remain issued, outstanding and unchanged.   (c) Prize
Securities.   (i) Prize Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof (but
subject to the provisions of Section 2.5(e)), each share of Prize Common
Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares of Prize Common Stock held by Dissenting Stockholders)
shall be converted into the right to receive (A) shares of validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable Parent Common Stock, with each such share of
Prize Common Stock being converted into that number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Conversion Number; and (B) cash in the amount of
the Cash Consideration. Each share of Prize Common Stock, when so converted,
shall automatically be cancelled and retired, shall cease to exist and shall
no longer be outstanding; and the holder of any certificate representing any
such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in exchange
therefor and the Cash Consideration (along with any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 2.5(e) and
any unpaid dividends and distributions with respect to such shares of Parent
Common Stock as provided in Section 2.5(c)), without interest, upon the
surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.5.   (ii) Prize
Treasury Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, all shares of
Prize Common Stock that are issued and held as treasury stock shall be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no shares of
Parent Common Stock, Cash Consideration or other consideration shall be paid
or payable in exchange therefor.   (iii) Prize Stock Options. The Parties
acknowledge that each Prize Stock Option shall be or become fully vested
prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each Prize Stock
Option shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, for each
Deemed Outstanding Prize Option Share, the Merger Consideration that is
payable in respect of each outstanding share of Prize Common Stock pursuant
to Section 2.4(c)(i). For purposes hereof, the "Deemed Outstanding Prize
Option Shares" attributable to each Prize Stock Option shall be equal to the
net number of shares of Prize Common Stock (rounded to the nearest one
thousandth of a share) that would be issued upon a cashless exercise of such
Option immediately before the Effective Time, computed by assuming that the
exercise price of such Option and all amounts required to be withheld
and paid by Prize in respect of federal taxes and other payroll
withholding obligations as a result of such exercise, using an assumed tax
rate of 40% ("Tax Withholding Amounts"), were satisfied by deducting from the
shares issued to the holder, the number of shares of Prize Common Stock
("Deemed Surrendered   13    Shares") with a fair value equal to such
exercise price and Tax Withholding Amounts. For purposes hereof, the fair
value of each Deemed Surrendered Share shall be equal to the amount of the
Merger Consideration that is payable in respect of each outstanding share of
Prize Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(i).   (iv) Prize Warrants.
All Prize Warrants shall remain outstanding following the Effective Time. At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Prize or any holder thereof, each Prize Warrant shall be assumed by
Parent and shall be exercisable on the same terms and conditions as apply
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that each Prize Warrant shall
be exercisable for that number of shares of Parent Common Stock and
the amount of Cash Consideration into which the number of shares of Prize
Common Stock subject to such Prize Warrant immediately prior to the Effective
Time would be converted under Section 2.4(c)(i).   (v) Other Interests.
Except as provided in this Section 2.4(c) or as otherwise agreed to by the
Parties, the provisions of any other plan, program or arrangement providing
for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital
stock of the Prize Companies shall become null and void.   (vi) Shares of
Dissenting Stockholders. Any issued and outstanding shares of Prize Common
Stock held by a Dissenting Stockholder shall be converted into the right to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting
Stockholder pursuant to the DGCL; provided, however, shares of Prize Common
Stock outstanding at the Effective Time and held by a Dissenting Stockholder
who shall, after the Effective Time, withdraw his demand for appraisal or
lose his right of appraisal as provided in the DGCL, shall be deemed to be
converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the shares of
Parent Common Stock and the Cash Consideration (without interest) specified
in Section 2.4(c)(i) in accordance with the procedures specified in Section
2.5(c). Prize shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal, withdrawals of demands for appraisal and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by Prize, and (B) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Prize will not voluntarily make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal and will not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, settle or offer to settle any such
demands.   2.5 Exchange of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Fund. Immediately
after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for
the benefit of the holders of shares of Prize Common Stock and for exchange
in accordance with this Agreement, certificates representing the shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued, and funds necessary to pay the Cash
Consideration, in exchange for shares of Prize Common Stock pursuant to
Section 2.4(b)(i). Such shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto (as provided in Section
2.5(c)) and such funds, are referred to herein as the "Exchange Fund." The
Exchange Agent, pursuant to irrevocable instructions consistent with the
terms of this Agreement, shall deliver the Parent Common Stock and  
14    the Cash Consideration to be issued or paid pursuant to Section
2.4(b)(i) out of the Exchange Fund, and the Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any other purpose whatsoever. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to
vote or exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the Parent Common
Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive
and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with
respect thereto for the account of Persons entitled thereto.   (b) Exchange
Procedures.   (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a Prize Certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
represented shares of Prize Common Stock, which was converted into the right
to receive Parent Common Stock and Cash Consideration pursuant to Section
2.4(b)(i), a letter of transmittal to be used to effect the exchange of such
Prize Certificate for a Parent Certificate (and cash in lieu of fractional
shares) and the Cash Consideration, along with instructions for using such
letter of transmittal to effect such exchange. The letter of transmittal (or
the instructions thereto) shall specify that delivery of any Prize
Certificate shall be effected, and risk of loss and title thereto shall pass,
only upon delivery of such Prize Certificate to the Exchange Agent and shall
be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify.   (ii) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Prize Certificate
for cancellation, together with a duly completed and executed letter of
transmittal and any other required documents (including, in the case of any
Person constituting an "affiliate" of Prize for purposes of Rule 145(c) and
(d) under the Securities Act, a written agreement from such Person as
described in Section 5.10, if not theretofore delivered to Parent): (A) the
holder of such Prize Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a Parent Certificate representing the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and Cash Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.4(b)(i), any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 2.5(e), and any unpaid
dividends and distributions that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.5(c) (after giving effect to any required withholding
of taxes); and (B) the Prize Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the Cash Consideration,
cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions, if
any, payable to holders of Prize Certificates.   (iii) In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Prize Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of Prize, a Parent Certificate representing the appropriate
number of shares of Parent Common Stock and the appropriate Cash
Consideration (along with any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any
unpaid dividends and distributions that such holder has the right to receive)
may be issued or paid to a transferee if the Prize Certificate representing
such shares of Prize Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer,
including such signature guarantees as Parent or the Exchange Agent may
request, and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid.   15    (iv) Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.5(b), each Prize Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender a
Parent Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock and Cash
Consideration as provided in Section 2.4(b)(i) (along with any cash in lieu
of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions).   (c)
Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock declared or made
after the Effective Time with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Prize Certificate. Subject to the
effect of applicable laws: (i) at the time of the surrender of a Prize
Certificate for exchange in accordance with the provisions of this Section
2.5, there shall be paid to the surrendering holder, without interest, the
amount of dividends or other distributions (having a record date after the
Effective Time but on or prior to surrender and a payment date on or prior to
surrender) theretofore paid with respect to the number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive (less the amount
of any withholding taxes that may be required with respect thereto); and (ii)
at the appropriate payment date, and, without duplicating any payment made
under clause (i) above, there shall be paid to the surrendering holder,
without interest, the amount of dividends or other distributions (having a
record date after the Effective Time but on or prior to surrender and a
payment date subsequent to surrender) payable with respect to the number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder receives (less the
amount of any withholding taxes that may be required with respect
thereto).   (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Prize Common Stock. All
shares of Parent Common Stock issued, and the Cash Consideration paid, upon
the surrender for exchange of shares of Prize Common Stock in accordance with
the terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.5(c) or (e))
shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Prize Common Stock. After the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the Surviving
Corporation\'s stock transfer books of the shares of Prize Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, a Prize Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation
for any reason, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Section 2.5.   (e) Treatment of Fractional Shares. No Parent Certificates or
scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued
in the Merger and, except as provided in this Section 2.5(e), no dividend or
other distribution, stock split or interest shall relate to any such
fractional share, and such fractional share shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent. In lieu of
any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which a holder of Prize Common
Stock would otherwise be entitled, such holder, upon surrender of a Prize
Certificate as described in this Section 2.5, shall be paid an amount in cash
(without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the Market Price by (ii) the
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled, in which case Parent shall make available to the
Exchange Agent, without regard to any other cash being provided to the
Exchange Agent, the amount of cash necessary to make such payments.  
16    (f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
and cash held by the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of this
Section 2.5 that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of Prize for a
period of one year following the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand. Thereafter, any former stockholders of Prize who have not
theretofore complied with the provisions of this Section 2.5 shall look only
to Parent for payment of their claim for Parent Common Stock, the Cash
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock (all
without interest).   (g) No Liability. Neither Parent, Prize, the Surviving
Corporation, the Exchange Agent nor any other Person shall be liable to any
former holder of shares of Prize Common Stock for any amount properly
delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by former
holders of Prize Common Stock for a period of three years following the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to the time at which
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
governmental entity) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become
the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such
holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously
entitled thereto.   (h) Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Prize Certificates. If
any Prize Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Prize
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Parent or
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any
claims that may be made against it with respect to such Prize Certificate,
the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Prize Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock and the Cash
Consideration (along with any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.5(e) and any unpaid dividends and distributions pursuant to Section
2.5(c)) deliverable with respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement.   2.6

Merger is accepted for filing by the Secretary of State of Delaware and the

however, that the Certificate of Merger and the Articles of Merger may be

provides for an effective time that occurs on the Closing Date immediately

Parent, Merger Sub and Prize shall use all reasonable efforts to take all
such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the
Merger under the DGCL and the TBCA as promptly as commercially   17   
practicable. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is

all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of either of
Merger Sub or Prize, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
are fully authorized, in the name of the Surviving Corporation or otherwise
to take, and shall take, all such lawful and necessary action.   ARTICLE

Companies (individually or collectively) is not greater than the undivided
interest set forth in (or derived from) Prize\'s Ownership Interests. No
fact, circumstance or condition of the title to an Oil and Gas Interest shall
be considered to effect a reduction in the value of the assets, unless due
consideration has been given to (a) the length of time that such Oil and Gas
Interest has been producing Hydrocarbons and has been credited to and
accounted for by the Prize Companies and their predecessors in title, if any,
and (b) whether any such fact, circumstance or condition is of the type that
can generally be expected to be encountered in the area involved and is

been credited to and accounted for by the Parent Companies and their
predecessors in title, if any, and (b) whether any such fact, circumstance or
condition is of the type that can generally be expected to be encountered in

described in this Section 5.3.   56    (i) Prize will not (and will
cause the Prize Subsidiaries and the Prize Representatives not to), and
Parent will not (and will cause the Parent Subsidiaries and the Parent
Representatives not to), use any information obtained pursuant to this
Section 5.3 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions

Section 5.3 to the contrary: (i) Prize shall not be obligated under the terms
of this Section 5.3 to disclose to Parent or the Parent Representatives, or
grant Parent or the Parent Representatives access to, information that is

Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Prize will (and will
cause each of the Prize Representatives to) terminate any and all

acquisition of the Prize Common Stock or the merger or other business
combination of Prize with or into any such third party.   (b) Prize will
not (and will cause the Prize Representatives not to) solicit, initiate or

contemplated by this Agreement), whether by merger, purchase of stock,
purchase of assets, tender offer, exchange offer or otherwise
(an "Alternative Proposal"); provided, however, that, if Prize or any
Prize Representative shall receive an Alternative Proposal, then Prize and
the Prize Representatives may (i) enter into discussions or negotiations with
respect to such Alternative Proposal with the Person presenting such
Alternative Proposal and provide information to such Person if the board of
directors of Prize determines in good faith, based on the advice of its legal
counsel, that such action is required in order for the board of directors of
Prize to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, and (ii) to the extent applicable,   57    take and
disclose to its stockholders a position as contemplated by Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act and/or make any other disclosure to
its stockholders with regard to an Alternative Proposal, if the board of
directors of Parent determines in good faith, based on the advice of its
legal counsel, that such disclosure is required in order for the board of
directors of Prize to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable law.   (c) Prize will promptly communicate to Parent the
terms and conditions of any Alternative Proposal that it may receive and will

any Prize Representative receives an Alternative Proposal and the board of
directors of Prize determines in good faith, based on the advice of its legal
counsel and financial advisor, that the Alternative Proposal is a Superior
Proposal, then the board of directors of Prize may approve and recommend such
Superior Proposal and, in connection therewith, withdraw or modify its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger. As used herein,
the term "Superior Proposal" means an Alternative Proposal which the board of
directors of Prize determines in good faith to be more favorable to Prize\'s
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger.   (e) Nothing
in this Section 5.4 shall permit Prize to terminate this Agreement except as

Statement/Prospectus to the stockholders of Prize:   (a) Prize shall have
received an opinion from a firm of investment bankers or financial advisors
selected by Prize (which opinion shall be reasonably acceptable in form and
substance to Prize) to the effect that the consideration to be received in
the Merger by the holders of shares of Prize Common Stock is fair to such
holders from a financial point of view, and such opinion shall not have been
withdrawn, revoked or modified.   (b) Prize shall have received an opinion
(reasonably acceptable in form and substance to Prize) from a law firm
selected by Prize to the effect that (i) the Merger will be treated for
federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, (ii) each of Parent, Prize and Merger Sub will be a party
to such reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code,
(iii) no gain or loss will be recognized by Parent, Prize or Merger Sub as a
result of the Merger, and (iv) no gain or loss, except with respect to the
amount of Cash Consideration received, cash received in lieu of fractional
shares and cash received by Dissenting Stockholders, will be recognized by a
stockholder of Prize as a result of the Merger with   58    respect to
the shares of Prize Common Stock converted into shares of Parent Common Stock
by such stockholder, and such opinion shall not have been withdrawn, revoked
or modified. Such opinion may be based upon representations of the Parties
and stockholders of the Parties.   5.6 Parent Stockholders Meeting. Parent
shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable law and its
articles of incorporation and bylaws to convene a meeting of its stockholders
as promptly as practicable after the date hereof for the purpose of voting on
the Prize Proposal. The Board of Directors of Parent shall recommend approval
of the Prize Proposal and shall take all lawful action to solicit such
approval, including timely mailing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the
stockholders of Parent. Notwithstanding the above, however, the following
shall be conditions to the mailing of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the
stockholders of Parent:   (a) Parent shall have received an opinion from a
firm of investment bankers or financial advisors selected by Parent (which
opinion shall be reasonably acceptable in form and substance to Parent) to
the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, the consideration to be received by the holders
of the Prize Common Stock in the Merger is fair to Parent from a financial
point of view, and such opinion shall not have been withdrawn, revoked or
modified.   (b) Parent shall have received an opinion (reasonably acceptable
in form and substance to Parent) of the type described in Section 5.5(b), but
excluding the opinion described in clause (iv) thereof, from counsel selected
by Parent and such opinion shall not have been withdrawn, revoked or
modified.   5.7 Registration Statement and Proxy Statement/Prospectus.  
(a) Parent and Prize shall cooperate and promptly prepare the
Registration Statement, and, subject to Parent\'s receiving the required
information from Prize, Parent shall file the Registration Statement with the
SEC as soon as practicable after the date hereof and in any event not later

and Prize shall cooperate with Parent (including furnishing all information
concerning Prize and the holders of Prize Common Stock as may be reasonably
requested by Parent), to have the Registration Statement declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. Parent
shall use all reasonable efforts, and Prize shall cooperate with Parent, to
obtain all necessary state securities laws or "blue sky" permits, approvals
and registrations in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to the Merger.   (b) Parent will cause the Registration Statement
(including the Proxy Statement/Prospectus), at the time it becomes effective
under the Securities Act, to comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. Prize will cause the information
it provides for such purpose to comply as to form in all material respects
with such provisions.   59    (c) Prize hereby covenants and agrees with
Parent that: (i) the Registration Statement (at the time it becomes effective
under the Securities Act and at the Effective Time) will not contain an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading (provided, however, that this clause (i) shall apply only to
information contained in the Registration Statement that was supplied by
Prize for inclusion therein); and (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (at the
time it is first mailed to stockholders of Prize and Parent, at the time of
the Prize Meeting and the Parent Meeting, and at the Effective Time) will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading (provided, however, that this clause (ii) shall apply only to
information contained in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus that was supplied
by Prize for inclusion therein). If, at any time prior to the Effective Time,
any event with respect to Prize, or with respect to other information
supplied by Prize for inclusion in the Registration Statement, occurs and
such event is required to be described in an amendment to the Registration
Statement, Prize shall promptly notify Parent of such occurrence and shall
cooperate with Parent in the preparation and filing of such amendment. If, at
any time prior to the Effective Time, any event with respect to Prize, or
with respect to other information supplied by Prize for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, occurs and such event is required to be described
in a supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Prize shall promptly
notify Parent of such occurrence and shall cooperate with Parent in the
preparation, filing and dissemination of such supplement.   (d) Parent
hereby covenants and agrees with Prize that: (i) the Registration Statement
(at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act and at the
Effective Time) will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading (provided, however, that this
clause (i) shall not apply to any information contained in the
Registration Statement that was supplied by Prize for inclusion therein); and
(ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (at the time it is first mailed to
stockholders of Prize and Parent, at the time of the Prize Meeting and the
Parent Meeting, and at the Effective Time) will not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading (provided,
however, that this clause (ii) shall not apply to any information contained
in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus that was supplied by Prize for inclusion
therein). If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event with respect
to Parent, or with respect to other information included in the Registration
Statement, occurs and such event is required to be described in an amendment
to the Registration Statement, such event shall be so described and such
amendment shall be promptly prepared and filed. If, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, any event with respect to Parent, or with respect to other
information included in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, occurs and such event
is required to be described in a supplement to the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Parent shall promptly notify Prize of such
occurrence and shall cooperate with Prize in the preparation, filing and
dissemination of such supplement.   (e) Neither the Registration Statement
nor the Proxy Statement/Prospectus nor any amendment or supplement thereto
will be filed or disseminated to the stockholders of Prize or Parent without
the approval of both Parent and Prize. Parent shall advise Prize, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement
has become effective under the   60    Securities Act, the issuance of
any stop order with respect to the Registration Statement, the suspension of
the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any comments or requests
for additional information by the SEC with respect to the Registration
Statement.   5.8 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall cause the shares of

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Prize and Parent
shall take, or cause to be taken, all action and shall do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, appropriate or desirable under any applicable
laws and regulations (including the HSR Act) or under applicable governing
agreements to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including using its best efforts to obtain all necessary
waivers, consents and approvals and effecting all necessary registrations and

Persons in the Merger, irrespective of whether or not they sign such
agreements.   5.11 Public Announcements. Prior to the Closing, Prize and

otherwise making any public statement with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any press release or make
any such public statement prior to obtaining the approval of the other party;
provided, however, that such approval shall not be required where such
release or announcement is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule;
and provided further, that either Prize or Parent may respond to inquiries by
the press or others regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, so long as such responses are consistent with such Party\'s

condition, or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder.  
5.13 Payment of Expenses. Each Party shall pay its own expenses incident
to preparing for, entering into and carrying out this Agreement and

Merger shall be consummated, except that: (a) the fee for filing the

with printing the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and complying with any

and soliciting the votes of the stockholders of Parent, shall be borne by

as Exhibit 5.14, at the Closing. The Parties shall take such action as
necessary to cause the shelf registration statement contemplated by the
Registration Rights Agreement to be declared effective as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time.   5.15 Indemnification and Insurance.   (a)
Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification now existing in favor of any
officers, directors, employees, controlling stockholders or agents of any of
the Prize Companies, as provided in their respective charters or bylaws
(or similar organizational documents), and any existing indemnification
agreements or arrangements of any of the Prize Companies, shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less
than four years from the Effective Time (or such longer period as may be
provided in any existing indemnification agreement between any of the Prize
Companies, and any current or former officer or director thereof); provided,
that, in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such four-
year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or
claims shall continue until final disposition of any and all such claims.  
(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, for a period of
four years after the Effective Time, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an   62   
officer, director, employee, controlling stockholder or agent of any of
the Prize Companies (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all
losses, expenses (including attorneys\' fees), claims, damages, liabilities
and amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the indemnifying
party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of, or otherwise in
connection with, any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (a "Claim"), based in whole or in part on or arising in whole
or in part out of the fact that the Indemnified Party (or the person
controlled by the Indemnified Party) is or was a director, officer, employee,
controlling stockholder or agent (including a trustee or fiduciary of any
Prize Employee Benefit Plan) and pertaining to any matter existing or arising
out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including any Claim arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under Nevada
law, and shall pay any expenses, as incurred, in advance of the final
disposition of any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted under Nevada law. In determining whether an
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Section 5.15, if
requested by such Indemnified Party, such determination shall be made by
special, independent counsel selected by Parent and approved by the
Indemnified Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld),
and who has not otherwise performed services for Parent or any of its
Affiliates within the last three years (other than in connection with such
matters). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against any Indemnified
Party(ies) (whether arising before or after the Effective Time): (i) Parent
shall have the right to control the defense of such matter with Parent\'s
regularly engaged independent legal counsel or other counsel selected by
Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party(ies), and Parent
shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel; and (ii) the
Indemnified Party(ies) will cooperate with Parent, at Parent\'s expense, in
the defense of any such matter. Parent shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld. In the event of any Claim, any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification will promptly notify Parent thereof
(provided, that failure to so notify Parent will not affect the obligations
of Parent except to the extent that Parent shall have been prejudiced as a
result of such failure) and shall deliver to Parent the undertaking
contemplated by the applicable provisions of the NGCL, but without any
requirement for the posting of a bond. Without limiting the foregoing, in the
event any such Claim is brought against any of the Indemnified Parties,
such Indemnified Party(ies) may retain only one law firm (plus one local
counsel, if necessary) to represent them with respect to each such matter
unless the use of counsel chosen to represent the Indemnified Parties would
present such counsel with a conflict of interest, or the representation of
all of the Indemnified Parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due
to actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case such
additional counsel as may be required (as shall be reasonably determined by
the Indemnified Parties and Parent) may be retained by the Indemnified
Parties at the cost and expense of Parent and Parent shall pay all reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for such Indemnified Parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 5.15 shall
be deemed to grant any right to any Indemnified Party which is not permitted
to be granted to an officer, director, employee, controlling stockholder or
agent of Parent under Nevada law.   (c) From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than four years
from the Effective Time the current policies of directors\' and   63  
officers\' liability insurance maintained by Prize, including the
policy being maintained for the former directors and officers of Vista
Energy Resources, Inc.; provided, that (i) Parent may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which
are no less advantageous; (ii) such substitution shall not result in gaps or
lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time; and (iii) Parent shall not be required to pay an annual premium in
excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by Prize prior to the date
hereof and if Parent is unable to obtain the insurance required by this
Section 5.15(c) it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for
an annual premium equal to such maximum amount.   (d) Following the Merger,
if Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person
or Persons, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent and any of their successors and
assigns, assume the obligations of the Parties and Parent set forth in this
Section 5.15.   (e) This Section 5.15 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger at the Effective Time, is intended to benefit Prize and the
Indemnified Parties (each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section
5.15) and shall be binding on the successors and assigns of Parent.   5.16
Prize Employees. After the Effective Time, it is expected that Parent may, in
its sole discretion, offer employment to, or cause the Surviving Corporation
or the Prize Companies to continue the employment of, certain employees of
the Prize Companies (the "Retained Employees"). Parent shall provide the
Retained Employees with the same benefits that accrue to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its subsidiaries. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, fulfill all coverage continuation
obligations imposed by Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 of ERISA for
those employees of the Prize Companies who are not Retained Employees. The
provisions of this Section 5.16 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the Parties and the employees of the Prize Companies
covered by the Prize Employee Benefit Plans at the Effective Time and their
respective heirs and representatives.   5.17 Severance Plan. After the
Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly pay the
amounts when due under the Prize Extraordinary Transaction Compensation
Policy, to the extent not already paid. The provisions of this Section 5.17
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Parties and each person entitled to receive payments pursuant to the terms of
the Prize Extraordinary Transaction Compensation Policy.   5.18 Termination
of Certain Agreements. At the Closing: (a) the Prize Voting and Shareholders
Agreement shall be terminated, (b) any Confidentiality and Non-Compete
Agreement entered into between Prize and any officer or employee of Prize
shall be terminated, and (c) that certain Advisory Services
and Indemnification Agreement, between Prize and Natural Gas Partners V, L.P.
shall be terminated, and no Person shall have any further rights or
obligations under any of these agreements, except for the continuation of
indemnity rights as provided in Section 5.15.   64    5.19 Parent Board
of Directors. At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause (a) two then existing
members of Prize\'s board of directors (selected by Prize and reasonably
acceptable to Parent) to be elected to the board of directors of Parent, and
(b) two then existing members of the Parent board of directors to resign.  
5.20 Registration Statements Relating to Prize Warrants. Promptly after
the Effective Time, Parent shall file with the SEC a registration statement
on Form S-3 with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
upon exercise of the Prize Warrants other than the Prize Warrants held by
First Union National Bank. Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to have
such registration statement become effective and to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status
of the related prospectus) for so long as any Prize Warrants other than the
Prize Warrants held by First Union National Bank remain outstanding. The
provisions of this Section 5.20 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, the Parties and each holder of a Prize Warrant other
than the Prize Warrants held by First Union National Bank and their
respective heirs and representatives. To the extent required by applicable
securities law and regulations, Parent shall also file with the SEC a
registration statement with respect to the Prize Warrants.   5.21 Bank
Credit Agreements. Each of Parent and Prize shall use its best efforts to
obtain, on or before the Closing Date: (a) any required consents of the
lenders under the Parent Bank Credit Agreement and the Prize Bank
Credit Agreement; or (b) a new credit facility for Parent in an amount
sufficient to pay off all then-outstanding indebtedness under both the Parent
Bank Credit Agreement and the Prize Bank Credit Agreement and provide a
similar amount of borrowing capacity as the Parent Bank Credit Agreement and
the Prize Bank Credit Agreement.   ARTICLE 6   CONDITIONS   6.1

contemplated hereby by Prize,   65   Parent and Merger Sub shall have
been made or obtained (as the case may be), except where the failure to

be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one
and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more  
72    counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to
the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the
same counterpart.   8.5 Severability. Any term or provision of this
Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to
such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.   8.6 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement (together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the documents and
instruments delivered by the Parties in connection with this Agreement): (a)
constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof; and (b) except as provided in Article 2 and
Sections 5.3(c), 5.3(d), 5.15, 5.16, 5.17 and 5.20, is solely for the benefit
of the Parties and their respective successors, legal representatives and
assigns and does not confer on any other Person any rights or remedies
hereunder.   8.7 Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed in all
respects, including validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the
State of Delaware regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under
applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.   8.8 No Remedy in
Certain Circumstances. Each Party agrees that, should any court or other
competent authority hold any provision of this Agreement or part hereof to be
null, void or unenforceable, or order any Party to take any
action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent herewith or
required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby, unless the foregoing inconsistent action or
the failure to take any action constitutes a material breach of this
Agreement or makes this Agreement impossible to perform, in which case this
Agreement shall terminate pursuant to Article 7. Except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent that a Party took an action
inconsistent herewith or failed to take action consistent herewith or
required hereby pursuant to an order or judgment of a court or other
competent Governmental Authority, such Party shall not incur any liability or
obligation unless such Party breached its obligations under Section 5.9 or
did not in good faith seek to resist or object to the imposition or entering
of such order or judgment.   8.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the Parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.   8.10 Waivers. At
any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties may, to the extent legally
allowed: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the   73    other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive performance of any of the covenants
or agreements, or satisfaction of any of the conditions, contained herein.
Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed by an authorized
representative of such Party. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action
taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf
of any Party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such
action of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any Party of a breach
of any provision hereof shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any
prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof.  
8.11 Confidentiality Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect following the execution of this Agreement
until terminated as described in Section 7.2, is hereby incorporated herein
by reference, and shall constitute a part of this Agreement for all
purposes; provided, however, that any standstill provisions contained therein
will, effective as of the Closing, be deemed to have been waived to the
extent necessary for the Parties to consummate the Merger in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. Any and all information received by Parent and
Prize pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be
governed by the applicable terms and provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement.   8.12 Incorporation. Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein
are attached to and by this reference incorporated herein for all purposes.
Disclosure on one schedule satisfies the other schedules as long as it is
apparent on its face from such disclosure that it applies to the other
schedules.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Agreement to
be executed by their duly authorized representatives, on the date first
written above.  "Prize" "Parent"  PRIZE ENERGY CORP. MAGNUM HUNTER

the proposed transaction in sufficient detail to enable Parent and its
counsel to determine that the proposed transaction will not violate the
