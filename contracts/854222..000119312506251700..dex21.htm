defined in Section 2.1 hereof) and (b) approved this Agreement upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent has approved this Agreement and the

representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

ARTICLE I

_THE MERGER_

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2),
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the
Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving entity following the Merger
(sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The
existence of the Company shall continue unaffected and unimpaired by the
Merger and, as the Surviving Corporation, it shall be governed by the DGCL.

Section 1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_.

(a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 10:00
a.m., New York City time, on a date to be specified by the parties, which
shall be no later than the third business day after the satisfaction or
waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it
being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices
of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four Times Square, New York, New
York 10036, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as
the " _Closing Date_."

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as soon as
practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_
") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and by making all
other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such subsequent date or
time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of
Merger. The time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein
as the " _Effective Time_." 

Section 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest
in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.



 

2 Section 1.4 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation_. The
Company Certificate of Incorporation, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law. The Bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

Section 1.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly
designated, as the case may be. The officers of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly designated, as the case may be.

ARTICLE II

_EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES _

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of
any shares of Company Common Stock:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to the provisions of Section
2.1(f) hereof, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(c) hereof and Dissenting Shares (as defined
in Section 2.3 hereof)) shall be converted into the right to receive:

(i) a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ")
equal to the Exchange Ratio. " _Exchange Ratio_ " means $7.75 divided by the

Stent Contingent Stock Rights, the " _Contingent Stock Rights_ "; the
Contingent Stock Rights, together with the shares of Parent Common Stock
referred to in clause (i) above, being referred to herein as the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a Certificate (as defined in Section 2.2(b)) which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to

Sub Common Stock are so converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving
Corporation that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective

(c) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each share, if any, of Company Common
Stock that is held by the Company as treasury shares and each share
of Company Common Stock which is owned by the Company or Parent or by any
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or Parent shall be
canceled without any conversion, and no consideration shall be delivered in
respect thereof. 

(d) _Company Stock Options_. Effective not later than the Closing, the Company

4  capital stock of the Company (the " _Company Stock Options_ ") outstanding
immediately before the Closing shall be cancelled and of no further force or
effect.

(i) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (ii) below, in consideration for
the cancellation of Company Stock Options outstanding under the Company
Equity Plan immediately before the Closing, the holders thereof (whether or
not such Company Stock Options shall otherwise be exercisable at the Effective
Time) shall receive effective as of the Closing such number of shares of
Parent Common Stock, but not less than zero, equal to (A) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to each such Company Stock Option held by such
holder multiplied by the excess, if any, of (I) the closing price per share
of Company Common Stock on the Nasdaq, as reported in The Wall Street Journal,
on the trading day most recently preceding the Closing Date over (II) the per-
share exercise price under such Company Stock Option, divided by (B) the

Closing Date; _provided_ that such Company Stock Option holder shall have
remitted to the Company or the Surviving Corporation payment by cash or check
equal to the aggregate amount of federal, state, local or foreign taxes that
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the cancellation of such Company Stock Option in
accordance with applicable Law, and the Surviving Corporation shall remit all
such withholdings to the appropriate taxing authority.

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i) above, to the extent a
holder of Company Stock Options outstanding under the Company Equity Plan
immediately before the Closing (whether or not such Company Stock Options
shall otherwise be exercisable at the Effective Time) consents in writing to
the treatment described in this paragraph (ii), such holder shall receive
the following:

(A) If the per-share exercise price of such Company Stock Option is less than
$7.75, (I) effective as of the Closing such number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each
such Company Stock Option held by such holder immediately before the Closing
multiplied by (1) the excess of (x) $7.75 over (y) the per-share exercise
price of such Company Stock Option divided by (2) the Parent Common Stock
Value (but not less than $6.59 nor more than $8.05) and (II) Parents unfunded
and unsecured promise to issue in the future, such number of shares of Parent
Common Stock as determined by the formula set forth on Exhibit 2.1(d)(ii)(A)
attached hereto.

(B) If the per-share exercise price of such Company Stock Option is $7.75 or
more, Parents unfunded and unsecured promise to issue in the future such
number of shares of Parent Common Stock as determined by the formula set
forth on Exhibit 2.1(d)(ii)(B) attached hereto.



 

5 (iii) All payments described in paragraph (ii) above shall be subject to
the withholding of all federal, state, local or foreign taxes in accordance
with applicable Law, and the Surviving Corporation (or its successor, as
applicable) shall remit all such withholdings to the appropriate taxing
authority.

(iv) No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of
this subsection (d), but in lieu thereof, any Company Stock Option holder who
would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to this subsection (d) (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder at such
time pursuant to paragraphs (i) and/or (ii), above, as the case may be), shall
receive an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by Parent Common
Stock Value (or, with respect to future issuances pursuant to paragraph (ii)
above, multiplied by the Current Stock Price (as defined in the applicable
Contingent Stock Rights Agreement)) (in each case, subject to the withholding
of all federal, state, local or foreign taxes in accordance with applicable
Law, which the Surviving Corporation (or its successor, as applicable) shall
remit to the appropriate taxing authority).

(e) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be
issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof Parent shall pay to each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder
(other than those that would be received pursuant to subsection (d) above)),
upon surrender of such holders Certificate(s), an amount of cash (rounded to
the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of: (i) such
fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Parent Common Stock Value.

(f) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted
to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to
Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock having a record date on or after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall engage a
nationally-recognized financial institution reasonably satisfactory to the
Company to act as exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II, through the Exchange Agent, certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section
2.1(a). In addition, Parent shall make available by depositing with the
Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, cash
in an amount sufficient to make the payments in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section  



 

6  2.1(e) and any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of
Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). All cash
and Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter
be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

(b)  _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ "), which at
the Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof, (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration,
cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c). Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a certificate or certificates representing that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.1 (which shall be in uncertificated book entry
form unless a physical certificate is requested), payment in lieu of
fractional shares which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section
2.1(e) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c),
and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, certificates representing
the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may be issued to a Person
(as defined in Section 8.14(ee)) other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction
of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (and any amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 2.1(e)
or Section 2.2(c)) upon such surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall
accrue on any amount payable pursuant to Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(c). 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.1(e) hereof, until such Certificate has
been surrendered in accordance with this Article II. Subject to applicable
Law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
recordholder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender,
the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange
therefor pursuant to this Article II, together with any cash payable in lieu
of a fractional share of  



 

7  Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.1(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole
shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, less the amount of any
withholding Taxes (as defined in Section 3.10(g)) that may be required
thereon.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All shares of
Parent Common Stock and Contingent Stock Rights issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II and
any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(c) shall be deemed to
have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificates. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or distributions pursuant to
Section 2.2(c).

 

(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Parent Common Stock
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), Contingent Stock Rights
or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate
shall not have been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time,
or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any shares of Parent Common
Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock,
Contingent Stock Rights or any dividends or distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock issuable in respect of such Certificate would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in
Section 3.5), any such shares, Contingent Stock Rights, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis;
_provided_ that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to former stockholders of the Company after the Effective Time
pursuant to this Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess
of the amounts payable pursuant to this Article II shall promptly be paid
to Parent.



 

8 (h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Person who was a holder of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent may be
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax
law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would
otherwise have been paid.

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common
Stock and Contingent Stock Rights as may be required pursuant to Section
2.1(a), cash for fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(c); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to
the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct
as indemnity, against any claim that may be made against Parent or the
Exchange Agent in respect of the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

(j) _Affiliates_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, no certificates representing
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be delivered to a Person who may be deemed
an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and the applicable rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")
thereunder until such Person has executed and delivered to Parent an
Affiliate Agreement (as defined in Section 5.15).

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
holders of such shares of Company Common Stock who properly exercise appraisal
rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be exchangeable for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will be entitled
only to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and
until such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their
rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time,
any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right,
such shares of Company Common Stock will thereupon be treated as if they had
been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisals of shares of Company Common Stock
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Section 3.3 _Authority_.

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject
to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (as defined below) in connection
with this Agreement and the Merger, to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no
other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby (other than obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval and the filing and recordation of appropriate merger
documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to bankruptcy,  



 

12  insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the rights
and remedies of creditors generally and to the effect of general principles
of equity. The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock entitled to vote in accordance with the DGCL, the Company
Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws (the " _Company
Stockholder Approval_ ") is the only vote of the holders of capital stock of
the Company necessary to approve this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) The Company Board of Directors (the " _Company Board_ "), at a meeting
duly called and held, duly and unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) determining that this Agreement is advisable and that the
terms of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and
(iii) recommending that the Companys stockholders adopt this Agreement. Such
resolutions are sufficient to render the provisions of Section 203 of the
DGCL inapplicable to this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, the
Merger, the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement in
connection with the Merger (the " _Share Issuance_ ") and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the Companys knowledge, no
other state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation applies or
purports to apply to the Company with respect to this Agreement, the Merger
or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the other

Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the Company SEC Reports, and the
statements contained in such certifications are true and accurate. For
purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries

any unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-
balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of
the SEC), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract is to

23  employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or any other
applicable Law (each, a " _Commonly Controlled Entity_ "), in each case,
providing benefits to any Company Participant, but not including the Company
Benefit Agreements (all such plans, arrangements, agreements and
understandings, including any such plan, arrangement, agreement
or understanding entered into or adopted on or after the date of this
Agreement, collectively, " _Company Benefit Plans_ "). Section 3.15(a)(ii) of
the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a list, as of the date hereof,
of (i) each employment, deferred compensation, change in control, severance,

of any unwritten Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement, a written
summary of the material provisions of such plan or agreement) in effect on the
date hereof, (ii) the most recent report on Form 5500 filed with the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to each Company Benefit Plan in effect on the
date hereof, to the extent any such report was required by applicable Law,
(iii) the most recent summary plan description for each Company Benefit Plan
for which such a summary plan description is required by applicable Law and
(iv) each currently effective trust agreement or other funding vehicle
relating to any Company Benefit Plan. Neither the Company nor any Commonly
Controlled Entity has sponsored, maintained, contributed to or been obligated

liability under, any benefit plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code or is otherwise a defined benefit pension plan or is a
plan described in Section 3(40) of ERISA or Section 413 of the Code. With
respect to any Company Welfare Plan or any Company Benefit Agreement that is
an employee welfare benefit plan, (A) no such Company Welfare Plan or Company
Benefit Agreement is unfunded or funded through a "welfare benefits fund" (as
such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code), (B) each such Company

similar state or local Law and (C) each such Company Welfare Plan and Company
Benefit Agreement (including any such plan or agreement covering retirees or
other former employees) may be amended or terminated without material
liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary on or at any time after the
Effective Time. No Company Welfare Plan or Company Benefit Agreement that is
an employee welfare benefit plan provides benefits to, or on behalf of, any
former employee after the termination of employment except (1) where the full
cost of such benefit is borne entirely by the former employee (or his eligible
dependents or beneficiaries) or (2) where the benefit is required by Section
4980B of the Code.

(c) (i) Each Company Benefit Plan and Company Benefit Agreement has been
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and with
all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code; (ii) all material
contributions, including participant contributions,  



 

24  and benefit payments required under each Company Benefit Plan and Company
Benefit Agreement have been made in full on a timely and proper basis pursuant
to the terms of such plan or agreement and applicable Law; (iii) no Company
Participant has received or is reasonably expected to receive any payment or
benefit from the Company or any Company Subsidiary that would be nondeductible
pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code or any other applicable Law; (iv) each
Company Pension Plan that is intended to comply with the provisions of Section
401(a) of the Code has been the subject of a determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service with respect to all Tax law changes with respect to
which the Internal Revenue Service is currently willing to provide a
determination letter to the effect that such Company Pension Plan currently is
qualified and exempt from income Taxes under Section 401(a) of the Code and
the trust relating to such plan is exempt from income Taxes under Section
501(a) of the Code, and no such determination letter has been revoked and, to
the knowledge of the Company, revocation has not been threatened, and no
event has occurred since the date of the most recent determination letter or
application therefor relating to any such Company Pension Plan that is
reasonably expected to adversely affect the qualification of such
Company Pension Plan or materially increase the costs relating thereto or
require security under Section 307 of ERISA; (v) the Company has made
available to Parent a copy of the most recent determination letter received
with respect to each Company Pension Plan for which such a letter has been
issued, as well as a copy of any pending application for a determination
letter and a complete and accurate list of all amendments to any Company
Pension Plan in effect as of the date hereof as to which a favorable
determination letter has not yet been received; (vi) there are no
understandings, agreements or undertakings, written or oral, with any Person
(other than pursuant to the express terms of the applicable Company Benefit
Plan or Company Benefit Agreement) that are (pursuant to any such
understandings, agreements or undertakings) reasonably expected to result in
any liabilities if such Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement were
amended or terminated upon or at any time after the Effective Time or that
would prevent any unilateral action by the Company (or, after the Effective
Time, Parent) to effect such amendment or termination; (vii) only officers,
directors and employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries are
eligible for compensation or benefits under the terms of each Company Benefit
Plan and Company Benefit Agreements, and each individual who is classified by
the Company or any Company Subsidiary as an "employee" or as an "independent
contractor" is properly so classified; and (viii) notwithstanding any oral or
written representation to the contrary, no Company Participant is entitled to
any gross-up, make-whole or other additional payment from the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in respect of any Tax (including Federal, state, local or
foreign income, excise or other Taxes (including Taxes imposed under Section
409A of the Code)) or interest or penalty related thereto.

 

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan and each Company Benefit Agreement that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code (a " _Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan_ ")
subject to Section 409A of the Code has been operated in compliance with
Section 409A of the Code since January 1, 2005, based upon a good faith,
reasonable interpretation of (i) Section 409A of the Code and (ii)(A) the
Proposed Regulations issued thereunder or (B) Internal Revenue Service Notice
2005-1 (clauses (i) and (ii), together, the " _409A Authorities_ "). No
Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement that would be a Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code but for the
effective date provisions that are applicable to Section 409A of the Code, as
set forth in Section 885(d) of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, as
amended (the  



 

25  " _AJCA_ "), has been "materially modified" within the meaning of Section
885(d)(2)(B) of the AJCA after October 3, 2004, based upon a good faith
reasonable interpretation of the AJCA and the 409A Authorities.

other material Company IP, to the knowledge of the Company, there is no basis
for any Litigation regarding any of the foregoing in (A)(1), (A)(2), (A)(3),
(A)(4) or (A)(5); no Company IP has been or is being used or enforced by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or, with respect to any or all of the
Product IP, by any of their licensors, in a manner that, individually or in
the aggregate, is reasonably likely to result in the cancellation, invalidity
or unenforceability of such Intellectual Property.

not forfeited or otherwise lost any right to file any material patent
applications or obtain any material patents in any country in North America or
those countries in Europe or Asia where the Company, Company Subsidiaries or
Company Partners market, sell, manufacture, develop or distribute the
Products, such as by failing to meet any filing deadline or otherwise; the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries have no reason to believe that the scope
of any issued claims under any patents under the Company IP should be less
than the scope reflected as of the date hereof in such patents or that the
scope of any issued claims under any patent applications under the Company IP
will or should be materially less than the scope reflected as of the date

Property, (B) restrict the Companys or any Company Subsidiaries businesses
in any material manner in order to accommodate any Persons Intellectual

reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality of the trade secrets
and other proprietary information under the Company IP. No current or former

knowledge of the Company, there has not been any disclosure of any material
confidential information of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (including
any such information of any other Person disclosed in confidence to the
Company or its Subsidiaries) to any Person in a manner that has resulted or
is likely to result in the loss of trade secret or other rights in and to such
information.

Company Subsidiary has adopted, or intends to adopt, a stockholders rights

ended September 30, 2006 includes all the Subsidiaries of Parent, other than
Merger Sub (each a " _Parent Subsidiary_ " and together, the " _Parent
Subsidiaries_ "), in existence as of the date hereof. All the outstanding
shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each such Parent
Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable and are, except as set forth in such Exhibit 21, owned directly
or indirectly by Parent, free and clear of all Liens and free of any other
restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise
dispose of such capital stock or other ownership interests), except for
restrictions imposed by applicable securities laws. Neither Parent nor any of
the Parent Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns or has any right or

Section 4.3 _Authority_.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements to which it is a party, to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and, subject to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval (as
defined below) in connection with the Merger, to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery
and performance by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements to which it is a party and the consummation by
each of Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of each of Parent and Merger Sub and
no other corporate proceedings on the part of each of Parent or Merger Sub,
respectively, are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the Transaction
Agreements to which it is a party or to consummate the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (other than obtaining the Parent
Stockholder Approval and the filing and recordation of appropriate merger
documents as required by the DGCL). Each of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements to which it is a party has been, or prior to the
Effective Time will be, duly executed and delivered by each of Parent and
Merger Sub, as applicable, and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery by the other parties hereto and thereto, constitutes, or prior
to the Effective time will constitute, a legal, valid and binding obligation
of each of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against each of Parent and Merger
Sub in accordance with its terms subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting
the rights and remedies of creditors generally and to the effect of general
principles of equity. The affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes
cast by the holders of Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock, voting
together as a single class, at the Parent Stockholders Meeting is the only
vote of the holders of any capital stock of Parent necessary to  



 

34  approve this Agreement, the Share Issuance and the other Transaction
Agreements to which Parent is a party (the " _Parent Stockholder Approval_
"). The affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast by holders of
Merger Sub Common Stock entitled to vote at a duly called and held meeting of
holders of Merger Sub Common Stock is the only vote of the holders of Merger
Sub Common Stock necessary to approve this Agreement, the Transaction
Agreements to which it is a party, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

(b) The Parent Board, at a meeting duly called and held duly and unanimously
adopted resolutions (i) approving this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, the Merger, the Share Issuance and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) determining that the terms of the Merger,
the Share Issuance and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are fair to and in the best interests of Parent and its stockholders and
(iii) recommending that Parents stockholders approve the Share Issuance. Such
resolutions are sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement and the
other Transaction Agreements, the Merger, the Share Issuance and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement the provisions of Section 203 of
the DGCL. To Parents knowledge, no other state takeover statute or similar
statute or regulation applies or purports to apply to Parent with respect to
this Agreement and other Transaction Agreements, the Merger, the Share
Issuance or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) The board of directors of Merger Sub, at a meeting duly called and held
(or acting by written consent) duly and unanimously adopted resolutions (i)
approving this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) determining that the terms of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to and in the
best interests of Merger Sub and its stockholders and (iii) recommending that
Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, approve and adopt this
Agreement and the Merger.

(d) Parent, in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has unanimously
approved and adopted this Agreement and the Merger.

(e) UBS Securities LLC has delivered to the Parent Board its opinion to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based on the
assumptions, qualifications and limitations contained therein, the Merger
Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to Parent. Parent will
make available to the Company a correct and complete copy of such opinion
solely for informational purposes after receipt thereof by Parent.

Section 4.4 _No Conflict_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
each of Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the performance of this Agreement
and the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party by each of Parent and
Merger Sub and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby will not, (a) assuming the Parent Stockholder
Approval is obtained, conflict with or violate (i) the Parent Organizational
Documents, (ii) the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub or the Bylaws
of Merger Sub or (iii) the equivalent organizational documents of any of the
Parent Subsidiaries, (b) subject to Section 4.5 and assuming the Parent
Stockholder Approval is obtained, conflict with or violate any Law or any
Order or any rule or regulation of any securities exchange on which Parents
Common Stock is listed for trading, in each case applicable to Parent  



 

35  or any of the Parent Subsidiaries or by which any property or asset of
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries is bound or affected, or (c) result
in a breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or
lapse of time or both would become a default) under, give to others any right
of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, result in the
triggering of any payment or other obligation or any right of consent, or
result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries pursuant to any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party or by
which Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries or any property or asset of any
of them is bound or affected except, in the case of clauses (a)(iii), (b) and
(c) above, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences which have not had and are not reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the Transaction
Agreements to which it is a party do not, and the performance by each of
Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements to
which it is a party will not, require any consent, approval, order,
authorization or permit of, or declaration, registration, filing with, or
notification to, any Governmental Entity, except for (i) applicable
requirements, if any, of (A) the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,
including, without limitation, the filing with the SEC of the Joint Proxy
Statement and of the Registration Statement in which the Joint Proxy Statement
will be included as a prospectus, and declaration of effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, (B) state securities or "blue sky" laws, (C) the DGCL
to file the Certificate of Merger or other appropriate documentation and (D)
Nasdaq, (ii) those required by the HSR Act, (iii) such filings and approvals
as are required to be made or obtained under any foreign antitrust,
competition or similar Laws in connection with the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the filing
of customary applications and notices, as applicable, with the FDA, the EMEA
or any other Regulatory Authority.

respectively:

clauses (i) and (ii) above, failures to comply, defaults or violations which
do not have and are not reasonably expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary has received any written communication during the past two years
from a Governmental Entity that alleges that Parent or a Parent Subsidiary is
not in compliance in any material respect with any applicable Law or Order.



 

36 (b) Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries and their respective employees
and, to Parents knowledge, Parent Partners (as defined below), as
applicable, has in effect all required filings, licenses, permits,
certificates, exemptions, orders, consents, clearances, registrations,
approvals and authorizations of all Governmental Entities necessary for the
conduct of their business and the use of their properties and assets, as
presently conducted and used, except where such failure has not had, or is not
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect; and neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary
has received written notice from any Governmental Entity that any such
license, permit, certificate, approval or authorization is subject to any
adverse action which has had, or is reasonably expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

the rules and regulations thereunder, each as in effect on the date so filed,
except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a subsequent
Parent SEC Report filed or furnished to the SEC by Parent, and in either case,

untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact

Filed SEC Report.

(b) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent Parent Filed SEC Report, all of the financial statements included

the SEC with respect thereto and have been prepared in accordance with GAAP

unaudited statements, to normal, year-end audit adjustments which are not
reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect). The consolidated balance sheets (including the
related notes) included in such Parent Financial Statements (if applicable,

Report) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries at the respective dates
thereof, and the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity
and cash flows (in each case, including the related notes) included in such
Parent Financial Statements (if applicable, as updated, amended, restated

the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with

sufficient to provide reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, consistently applied, (B) that transactions are executed only in
accordance with the authorization of management and (C) regarding prevention
or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
Parents assets.

(ii) Parents "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules

ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Parent required

affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or limited
purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where
the result, purpose or intended effect of such contract is to avoid

accountants certify has not been appropriately and adequately remedied by
Parent.

(e) The effectiveness of any additional SEC disclosure requirement that, as
of the date of this Agreement, has been formally proposed that is not yet in
effect, is not expected by Parent to lead to any material change in Parents
disclosures as set forth in the Parent SEC Reports.

(f) None of the Parent Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since September 30,
2005, been, subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) and 15(d)

default under the provisions of, any Parent Material Contract, except
defaults which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. True and complete copies of
all Parent Material Contracts have been made available to the Company.

Section 4.13 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) (i) Each Parent Benefit Plan has been administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and with all applicable Laws, including
ERISA and the Code; and (ii) each Parent Benefit Plan that is intended to
comply with the provisions of Section 401(a) of the Code has been the subject
of a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to
all Tax law changes with respect to which the Internal Revenue Service is

Pension Plan that is reasonably expected to adversely affect the qualification

or require security under Section 307 of ERISA. " _Parent Benefit Plans_ "
mean all plans, arrangements, agreements and understandings sponsored,
maintained or contributed to by Parent or any Parent Commonly Controlled
Entity for the benefit of present and former employees or directors of Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries or their beneficiaries, or providing benefits to
such persons in respect of such services provided to any such entity. "
_Parent Commonly Controlled Entity_ " means any person that, together with

funding vehicle relating to any Parent Benefit Plan. Neither Parent nor any
Parent Commonly Controlled Entity has sponsored, maintained, contributed to or
been obligated to sponsor, maintain or contribute to, or has any actual or
contingent liability under, any benefit plan that is subject to Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or is otherwise a defined benefit pension
plan or is a plan described in Section 3(40) of ERISA or Section 413 of the
Code. With respect to any welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA) (sometimes referred to individually as a " _Parent Welfare Benefit
Plan_ " and collectively as the " _Parent Welfare Benefit Plans_ "), (A) no
such Parent Welfare Plan is unfunded or funded through a "welfare benefits
fund" (as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code), (B) each such
Parent Welfare Plan that is a "group health plan" (as such term is defined in

and (C) each such Parent Welfare Plan (including any such plan or agreement
covering retirees or other former employees) may be amended or terminated
without material liability to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary on or at
any time after the Effective Time. No Parent Welfare Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan provides benefits to, or on behalf of, any former
employee after the termination of employment except (1) where the full cost of
such benefit is borne entirely by the former employee (or his eligible
dependents or beneficiaries) or (2) where the benefit is required by Section
4980B of the Code.

benefit payments required under each Parent Benefit Plan have been made in

Subsidiary that would be nondeductible pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Code
or any other applicable Law; and (ii) Parent has made available to the
Company a copy of the most recent determination letter received with respect
to each Parent Benefit Plan for which such a letter has been issued, as well

complete and accurate list of all amendments to any Parent Benefit Plan in

(a) Each of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries has been at all times and is in
compliance with all applicable Environmental Laws, including, but not limited

under applicable Environmental Laws, except for such noncompliance as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.



 

44 (b) There is no pending or, to Parents knowledge, threatened claim, lawsuit
or administrative proceeding against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary under or
pursuant to any Environmental Law that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

administrative or judicial order or decree pursuant to the Environmental
Laws that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.15  _Intellectual Property_.

(a) Parent has or the Parent Subsidiaries have an unrestricted and exclusive
ownership interest in all Parent Owned IP (in each case, free and clear of
any Liens) and is listed in the records of the appropriate United States,
foreign or other registry as the sole and exclusive current owner of record
for each application and registration included in the Parent Owned IP. The
Parent IP includes all Intellectual Property, and Parents and the Parent
Subsidiaries rights in and to the Parent IP include all Intellectual Property
rights, used or otherwise exploited in or necessary for the conduct of the
business of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries as currently conducted and
planned to be conducted. No academic institution or Governmental Entity has
any right, title or interest in or to any Parent Owned IP (including any
"march in" rights). Parent or a Parent Subsidiary has taken commercially
reasonable efforts, or contractually requires the Parent Partners in those
jurisdictions where the Parent Products are marketed or sold solely through
Parent Partners to take commercially reasonable efforts, to make appropriate
submissions of the Parent IP to the FDAs "Orange Book" and all equivalent
documents maintained by the EMEA or any other Regulatory Authority for
jurisdictions in which Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries sells,
markets or authorizes the sale or marketing of the Products.

(b) To Parents knowledge, the Contracts under which Parent has been granted
rights in any Intellectual Property owned or controlled by a third Person are
valid and legally enforceable, and free and clear of all Liens. Parent has
provided the Company with access to true and complete copies of all Parent IP
Contracts (as defined below) related to any or all Parent Products, other than
standard license agreements for commercially-available, off-the-shelf
software. Parent or a Parent Subsidiary has the exclusive right to develop,
commercialize, manufacture, market, sell, import and otherwise exploit each of
the Parent Products and (ii) neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has
granted, assigned or otherwise transferred to any Person any right, title
or interest in or to any Parent Product or Parent Product IP. " _Parent IP
Contracts_ " shall include all material Contracts under which Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary has obtained or granted any rights, title or interests in
or to, or which by their terms expressly restrict Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary with respect to any Intellectual Property.

(c) To the knowledge of Parent, no Person, during the past six years, has
misappropriated, infringed, diluted, or otherwise violated, either directly or
indirectly, any Parent IP, nor is any Person currently doing so. To the
knowledge of Parent, no Litigations have been brought or threatened against
any Person during the past six years, with respect to any Parent IP by Parent,
any Parent Subsidiary or, with respect to any or all of the Parent Product IP
and, to the knowledge of Parent, by any of their licensors during the past
six years and, to the knowledge of Parent, there is no basis for any
Litigation regarding any of the foregoing.



 

45 (d) (A) There has not been any Litigation during the past six years with
respect to any Parent IP, there is no pending Litigation and, to the
knowledge of Parent, there is no threatened Litigation (1) alleging
misappropriation, infringement, dilution or other violation by Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary of any Intellectual Property of any Person, (2) challenging
Parents or any Parent Subsidiarys ownership or use of, or the registrability
or maintenance of, any Parent Owned IP, (3) challenging the validity or
enforceability of any Parent Owned IP, (4) alleging that the use by Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary of Parent Licensed IP is in breach of any applicable
grant, license, agreement, instrument or other arrangement pursuant to which
Parent or any Affiliate acquired the right to use such Intellectual Property,
or (5) alleging misuse or antitrust violations arising from the use or other
exploitation of any Intellectual Property, and (B) with respect to (1) any or
all of the Products and (2) any other material Parent IP, to Parents
knowledge, there is no basis for any Litigation regarding any of the foregoing
in (A)(1), (A)(2), (A)(3), (A)(4) or (A)(5); no Parent IP has been or is being
used or enforced by Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or, with respect to
any or all of the Product IP, by any of their licensors, in a manner that,
individually or in the aggregate, is reasonably likely to result in the
cancellation, invalidity or unenforceability of such Intellectual Property.

(e) All patents and patent applications, trademark registrations and
applications and all other applications, registrations and filings under the
Parent IP (A) meet all material applicable requirements for obtaining a
patent, trademark registration or other Intellectual Property registration,
including any applicable disclosure requirements, (B) are subsisting, in full
force and effect, (C) to the knowledge of Parent, are valid and enforceable,
(D) have not expired, been cancelled or abandoned, and (E) have had paid in a
timely manner all registration, maintenance and renewal fees necessary to
preserve the rights of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries in connection with
such Intellectual Property.

(f) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have taken all commercially reasonable
measures to obtain patent rights worldwide, to the extent commercially
reasonable to do so, under Parent Owned IP and Parent Licensed IP as to which
they have the necessary prosecution rights, and, to Parents knowledge, have
not forfeited or otherwise lost any right to file any material patent
applications or obtain any material patents in any country in North America or
in those countries in Europe or Asia where Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or
Parent Partners market, sell, manufacture, develop, or distribute the Parent
Products, such as by failing to meet any filing deadline or otherwise; Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries have no reason to believe that the scope of any
issued claims under any patents under the Parent IP should be less than the
scope reflected as of the date hereof in such patents or that the scope of any
issued claims under any patent applications under the Parent IP will or should
be materially less than the scope reflected as of the date hereof in such
patent applications.

(g) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has granted any Person any right
to control the prosecution or registration of any Parent Product IP or to
bring, defend or otherwise control any Litigations with respect to Parent
Product IP.

(h) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has entered into nor is subject
to any consents, judgments, orders, indemnifications, forbearances to sue,
settlement agreements, licenses or other arrangements in connection with the
resolution of any disputes or Litigations that (A) restrict Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary with respect to any material Intellectual Property,  



 

46  (B) restrict Parents or any Parent Subsidiary businesses in any material
manner in order to accommodate any Persons Intellectual Property, or (C)
permit any Person to use any material Parent IP except as expressly permitted
under an Parent IP Contract.

(i) Parent and each Parent Subsidiary has implemented commercially reasonable
measures to maintain the confidentiality of the trade secrets and other
proprietary information under the Parent IP. No current or former employee or
contractor of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary owns any right, title or
interest in or to any of the Parent Owned IP. To the knowledge of Parent,
there has not been any disclosure of any material confidential information of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (including any such information of any other
Person disclosed in confidence to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary) to any
Person in a manner that has resulted or is likely to result in the loss of
trade secret or other rights in and to such information.

Section 4.16 _Stockholders  Rights Agreement_. Neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary has adopted, or intends to adopt, a stockholders rights agreement
or any similar plan or agreement which limits or impairs the ability to
purchase, or become the direct or indirect beneficial owner of, capital shares
or any other equity or debt securities of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. 

Section 4.17 _Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other Person, other than UBS Securities LLC, the fees and expenses of which
will be paid by Parent, is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial
advisors or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of Parent.

Committee shall be responsible for organizing, developing, managing and  



 

52  implementing a transition plan for the prompt and efficient integration of
the business organizations of Parent and the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries (the " _Transition Plan_ ") subject to the
requirement that control of the management, properties and assets of Parent
and the Company, as set forth in this Agreement, shall at all times prior to
the Effective Time remain under the control of their respective Boards of
Directors. The Transition Committee shall report its findings and make
recommendations to the Board of Directors of each of Parent and the Company
with respect to transition matters. Noah Beerman will manage and be
responsible for the day-to-day activities and operations of the Transition
Committee.

Section 5.4  _Notification of Certain Matters; Regulatory Communications_.

(a) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company and the Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, as the case may be, of the occurrence, or failure to
occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely
to cause (a)(i) any representation or warranty of such party contained in
this Agreement that is qualified as to "materiality" or "Material Adverse
Effect," to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (ii) any other
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at any time from
and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or (b) any
material failure of Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be,
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. In addition, Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company and the Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, as the case may be, of any change or event having, or which is
reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, on
such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or which would be
reasonably likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions set
forth in Article VI to be satisfied. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.4 will not limit or otherwise affect
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties, the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the
conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the Merger.

(b) The Company: (i) shall keep Parent promptly informed of (A) any
communication (written or oral) with or from the FDA, EMEA and any other
Regulatory Authority and (B) any material communications (written or oral)
received from any Person relating to the Company IP and (ii) shall not make
any submissions to, or have discussions with, the FDA, EMEA and any other
Regulatory Authority without prior disclosure to Parent of the details of such
communications or submissions. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
periodic basis of any material communications from the FDA, EMEA and any other
Regulatory Agency relating to any of the Products.

Section 5.5 _Antitrust Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Each party shall make or cause to be made, in cooperation with the other
parties and to the extent applicable and as promptly as practicable, (i) an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) all other
necessary filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations and
notices with other Governmental Entities under Competition Laws relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby. " _Competition Laws_ " mean the HSR
Act, the Sherman  



 

53  Antitrust Act of 1890, as amended, the Clayton Act of 1914, as amended, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States federal
or state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative or judicial doctrines or other laws that are designed to
prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of
monopolization or restraint of trade. Each party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to respond at the earliest practicable date to any requests for
additional information made by the United States Department of Justice (the "
_DOJ_ ") or any other Governmental Entities, and act in good faith and
reasonably cooperate with the other party in connection with any investigation
of any Governmental Entity. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to furnish to each other all information required for any filing, form,
declaration, notification, registration and notice. Each party shall give the
other party reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and any
proposed understanding or agreement with, any Governmental Entity regarding
any filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations or notices,
and permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed communication,
understanding or agreement with any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement. None of the parties shall
independently participate in any meeting, or engage in any substantive
conversation, with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings or
inquiry without giving the other party prior notice of the meeting and, unless
prohibited by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate. The parties will consult and cooperate with one another
in connection with any information or proposals submitted in connection with
proceedings under or relating to any Competition Law. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts:
(i) to avoid the entry of any judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay
the Closing; (ii) to eliminate every impediment under any Competition Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Entity so as to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the
Outside Date (as defined herein)); and (iii) vigorously to contest and resist
any such action or proceeding, including any administrative or judicial
action.

(b) Subject to Section 5.5(c), each of the parties to this Agreement agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties to this Agreement in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (i) the obtaining of all other necessary actions or nonactions,
waivers, consents, licenses, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals
from Governmental Entities and the making of all other necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities, if
any), (ii) the obtaining of all consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties related to or required in connection with the Merger that are
necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) the preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement and the
Registration Statement, (iv) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement, and
(v) the providing of all such information concerning such party, its
subsidiaries, its Affiliates and its subsidiaries and Affiliates officers,
directors, employees and partners as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any of the matters set forth in Section 5.5(a) or this Section 5.5(b).
Each of Parent and the Company agrees that it will use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain prior to the Effective Time each of the consents that are
listed in Section 5.5(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.



 

54 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.5, neither
Parent nor the Company shall be required in order to resolve any objections
asserted under Competition Laws by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to divest any of its businesses,
product lines or assets, or take or agree to take any other action or agree
to any limitation or restriction, that is reasonably likely to result in a
Parent Material Adverse Effect (determined, for purposes of this clause, after
giving effect to the Merger) or a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.6 _No Solicitation; Company Board Recommendation_.

(a) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of the Company
Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action designed to, or which
is reasonably expected to, facilitate, any Company Takeover Proposal, (ii)
enter into any agreement with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal
or (iii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect
to, or otherwise cooperate with, any proposal that constitutes, or is
reasonably expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal. The Company
shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any
proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, any Company
Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, in response
to a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal that the Company Board
determines (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) constitutes, or is reasonably expected to
lead to, a Superior Proposal, and which Company Takeover Proposal was not
solicited after the date hereof, was made after the date hereof and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.6(a), the Company may, if a
majority of the Company Board determines (after receiving the advice of
outside counsel) that it is necessary to take such actions in order to comply
with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable
Law, and subject to compliance with this Section 5.6(a) and Section 5.6(c) and
after giving Parent written notice of such determination, (x) furnish
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives)
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (which agreement shall
include a customary "standstill" or similar covenant) not less restrictive of
such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that (1) all such
information has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent
prior to the time it is provided to such Person and (2) such
customary confidentiality agreement expressly provides the right for the
Company to comply with the terms of this Agreement, including Section 5.6(b),
and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Company
Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.6(a) by any
Representative or Affiliate of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.6(a) by the Company.

The term " _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer
from any Person relating to, or that is reasonably expected to lead to, any
direct or indirect  



 

55  acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of transactions, of
assets or businesses that constitute 15% or more of the revenues, net
income, EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and
amortization) or the assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary, any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar transaction
involving the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to which any Person
or the stockholders of any Person would own 15% or more of any class of
equity securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or of any resulting
parent company of the Company, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide Company Takeover Proposal (
_provided_ , that for purposes of this definition references to 15% in the
definition of "Company Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to
50%) which the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
to be (i) more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial
point of view than the Merger, taking into account all relevant factors
(including all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement
(including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable of being
completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal.

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, (i) (A)
withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub),
or publicly propose to withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub), the adoption, approval, recommendation or declaration
of advisability by such board of directors or any such committee thereof of
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt, approve or declare advisable, or propose
publicly to recommend, adopt, approve or declare advisable, any
Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) adopt,
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to adopt,
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or is reasonably expected to lead to, any Company Takeover
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
5.6(a) pursuant to and in accordance with the limitations set forth therein).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change if a majority of the Company Board determines (after
receiving the advice of outside counsel) that it is necessary to take such
actions in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change may be made until after the fifth
calendar day following Parents receipt of written notice (a " _Company Notice
of Adverse Recommendation_ ") from the Company advising Parent that the
Company Board intends to take  



 

56  such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and
conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action
by the Company Board (it being understood and agreed that (x) any amendment
to any material term of such Superior Proposal or (y) with respect to any
previous Company Adverse Recommendation Change, any material change in the
principal stated rationale by the Company Board for such previous Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, shall, in the case of either (x) or (y),
require a new Company Notice of Adverse Recommendation and a new five (5)
calendar day-period). In determining whether to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall take into account any changes
to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a Company
Notice of Adverse Recommendation or otherwise.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 5.6(a)
and 5.6(b), (i) the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in
writing (and in any case within 24 hours) of any Company Takeover Proposal or
any inquiry that is reasonably expected to lead to any Company Takeover
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the
Person making any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) the
Company shall (A) keep Parent fully and promptly informed of the status and
material details (including any change to any material term thereof) of any
such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (B) provide to Parent promptly
after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all correspondence and other
written material sent or provided to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries from any Person that describes any of the terms or conditions of
any Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry. In addition, during the period from
the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, neither Parent nor the
Company shall terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality agreement to which it or any of its respective Subsidiaries is
a party. During such period, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall
enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the provisions
of any such agreement, including by obtaining injunctions to prevent any
breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereof in any court of the United States of America or of any
state having jurisdiction.

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.6 shall prohibit the Company from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14(e)-2(a) or Rule 14(d)-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making
any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment
of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so
disclose would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that all actions taken or agreed to be taken by the Company or the Company
Board or any committee thereof shall comply with the provisions of Section
5.6(a).

Section 5.7 _Parent Board Recommendation_.

(a) Neither the Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw (or
qualify or modify in a manner adverse to the Company), or publicly propose
to withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to the Company), the
adoption, approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such
Parent Board or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Share
Issuance) (any such action being referred to as a " _Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the Parent Stockholder  



 

57  Approval, the Parent Board may make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
if a majority of the Parent Board determines (after receiving the advice
of outside counsel) that it is necessary to take such actions in order to
comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of Parent under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change may be made until after the fifth calendar day
following the Companys receipt of written notice from Parent advising the
Company that the Parent Board intends to take such action and specifying the
reasons therefor.

(b) Nothing contained in this Section 5.7 shall prohibit Parent from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14(e)-2(a)
or Rule 14(d)-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
disclosure to Parents stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Parent Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose
would be inconsistent with applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
actions taken or agreed to be taken by Parent or the Parent Board or any
committee thereof shall comply with the provisions of Section 5.7(a).

Section 5.8 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate (at Parents expense) in the defense or settlement
of any stockholder Litigation against the Company and its directors relating
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that Parent shall not be obligated to
consent to any settlement which does not include full release of Parent and
its affiliates.

Section 5.9 _Indemnification; Director and Officer Insurance_. For not less
than six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees to, and to
cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present directors, officers and employees of the Company to the same extent
such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to the Company Certificate of Incorporation and Company By-Laws and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this Agreement
with any directors, officers or employees of the Company for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent agrees to, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and
hold harmless such Persons to the fullest extent permitted by law for acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, for an aggregate period of not less than six
years from the Effective Time, the Companys current directors and officers
an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no
less favorable than the Companys existing policy or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required
to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 250 percent of
the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement.

Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release shall be a
joint press release and thereafter the Company and Parent each shall obtain
the prior consent of the other prior to issuing any press releases or making
other public statements and communications with respect to the Merger, the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and Products,  



 

58  except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with or rules of Nasdaq. In addition, the Company and Parent
shall develop a joint communications strategy and each party shall ensure
that all press releases and other public statements and communications
(including any communications that would require a filing under the Rule 425,
Rule 165 and Rule 166 of the Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 of the Exchange
Act), with analysts, members of the financial community or otherwise, with
respect to the Merger, the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and Products shall be consistent in all material respects with such joint
communications strategy.

Section 5.11 _Preparation of SEC Documents; Stockholders  Meetings_. 

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a joint proxy statement
relating to the Company Stockholder Approval and Parent Stockholder Approval
(such joint proxy statement, as amended or supplemented from time to time, the
" _Joint Proxy Statement_ "), and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC
a registration statement on Form S-4 together with all amendments thereto,
(the " _Registration Statement_ "), in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be
included as a prospectus. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. Parent
will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be
mailed to Parents stockholders, and the Company will use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys
stockholders, in each case as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement will be made by Parent or the Company without the other partys
prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and
without providing the other party the opportunity to review and comment
thereon. Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, or
the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger and the Share Issuance for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, and each party will advise the other promptly of any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any information (including any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change) relating to Parent or the Company, or
any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should become
known to Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any of the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement,
so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by law, disseminated to the stockholders of Parent and the
Company.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall supply such information specifically
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement
 



 

59  necessary so that, at the time the Registration Statement is filed with the
SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it
becomes effective under the Securities Act, the Registration Statement shall
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement
necessary so that, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys
stockholders or Parents stockholders or at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders Meeting, the Joint Proxy
Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading. Each of the parties hereto shall use their best
efforts so that the Joint Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

 

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, and in
accordance with applicable Law and the Company Organizational Documents, in
the case of the Company, and the Parent Organizational Documents, in the case
of Parent, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders as
promptly as practicable to consider, in the case of Parent, the Share
Issuance (the " _Parent Stockholders  Meeting_") and, in the case of the
Company, the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger (the "
_Company Stockholders  Meeting_"). Unless there has been a Company Change of
Recommendation (in the case of the Company) or Parent Change of Recommendation
(in the case of Parent), as the case may be, each of the Company and Parent
will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies
in favor of, in the case of Parent, the Share Issuance, and, in the case of
the Company, the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the Merger, and
will take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or
consent of its stockholders required by the rules of Nasdaq or applicable Law
to obtain such approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Company or Parent may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting or Parent Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be, to
the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to
the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to its respective stockholders in
advance of a vote on, in the case of Parent, the Share Issuance, and, in the
case of the Company, the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger, or, if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting or
Parent Stockholders Meeting, as the case may be, is originally scheduled,
there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock,
as the case may be, represented (either in Person or by proxy) to constitute
a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting. Unless there has
been a Company Adverse Recommendation Change (in the case of the Company) or a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change (in the case of Parent), each of the
Company and Parent shall ensure that the Company Stockholders Meeting and
the Parent Stockholders Meeting, respectively, is called, noticed, convened,
held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited in connection with the
Company Stockholders Meeting or Parent Stockholders Meeting, as the case
may be, are solicited in compliance with applicable Law, the rules of Nasdaq
and, in the case of the Company, the Company Organizational Documents, and, in
the case of Parent, the Parent Organizational Documents. Without the prior
written consent of Parent, approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger are the only matters which the Company shall propose to be acted on by
the Companys stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting. Without the
prior written consent of the Company (not to be  



 

60  unreasonably withheld or delayed), approval of the Share Issuance is the
only matter which Parent shall propose to be acted on by Parents
stockholders at the Parent Stockholders Meeting.

(d) Unless there has been a Company Change of Recommendation (in the case of
the Company) or a Parent Change of Recommendation (in the case of Parent),
each of the Company and Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting and Parent Stockholders Meeting,
respectively, on the same date as the other party and as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement.

(e) Unless there has been a Company Change of Recommendation (in the case of
the Company) or a Parent Change of Recommendation (in the case of Parent): (i)
the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Parent shall recommend that
its stockholders vote in favor of, in the case of the Company, the approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholders
Meeting, and, in the case of Parent, the Share Issuance at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement shall include a
statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of (A) Parent has
recommended that Parents stockholders vote in favor of the Share Issuance at
the Parents Stockholder Meeting and (B) the Company has recommended that
the Companys stockholders vote in favor of approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholders Meeting and (iii)
neither the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent nor any committee
thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw,
amend or modify in a manner adverse to the other party, the recommendation of
its respective Board of Directors that the respective stockholders of the
Company or Parent vote in favor of, in the case of the Company, the approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, and, in the case of Parent, the
Share Issuance.

Section 5.12 _Nasdaq Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger
and the Share Issuance to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq, subject
to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

Section 5.13 _Tax Treatment of Merger_. The parties to this Agreement
intend that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)
of the Code, and each shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective
subsidiaries to, take any action, or fail to take any action, that would
reasonably be expected to jeopardize the qualification of the Merger as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

Section 5.14 _Accountant s Letters and Consents_.

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause to be delivered to the other party two letters from their respective
independent accountants, one dated approximately as of the date the
Registration Statement is declared effective and one dated approximately as of
the Closing Date, each addressed to the other party, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the other party and customary in scope and
substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in
connection with registration statements similar to the Registration
Statement. 



 

61 (b) Parent and the Company will each use its reasonable best efforts to cause
to be delivered to each other consents from their respective independent
auditors, dated the date on which the Registration Statement shall become
effective or a date not more than two days prior to such date, in form
reasonably satisfactory to the recipient and customary in scope and substance
for consents delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements on Form S-4 under the Securities Act.

Section 5.15 _Affiliates_. Not less than 45 days prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all Persons who, in
the judgment of the Company, may be deemed at the time this Agreement is
submitted for adoption by the stockholders of the Company, "affiliates" of the
Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act and applicable SEC
rules and regulations, and such list shall be updated as necessary to reflect
changes from the date thereof. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each Person identified on such list to deliver to Parent not
less than 30 days prior to the Effective Time, a written
agreement substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit 5.15_ hereto (an "
_Affiliate Agreement_ ").

Section 5.16  _Employees_.

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either (i) provide the employees of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who are employed immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Covered Employees_ ") who remain employed during
such period by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries with compensation and benefits (excluding equity based
compensation) which have a value substantially comparable, in the aggregate,
to the compensation and benefits provided by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof or (ii) provide or cause the Surviving
Corporation (or, in such case, its successors or assigns) to provide Covered
Employees who remain employed during such period by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries with compensation and benefits
that, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable in the aggregate to
the Covered Employees than those provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries. Effective not later than the Closing
Date, Parent will establish a retention program for those Company employees
Parent determines to seek to retain. Parent shall have no obligation and the
Company shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring Parent
or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans or to continue the
employment of any specific Person.

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, and non-
forfeitable rights under, but not for purposes of benefit accrual under, any
employee benefit plan or arrangement of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, Covered Employees shall receive
service credit for service with the Company (and with any predecessor or
acquired entities or any other entities for which the Company granted service
credit) as if such service had been completed with Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of
service.

(c) To the extent applicable, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and any of their respective Subsidiaries to waive, or use
reasonable best efforts to  



 

62  cause its insurance carriers to waive, any pre-existing condition limitation
on participation and coverage applicable to any Covered Employee or any of
his or her covered dependents under any health or welfare plan of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries (a " _New
Plan_ ") in which such Covered Employee or covered dependent shall
become eligible to participate after the Effective Time to the extent such
Covered Employee or covered dependent was no longer subject to such pre-
existing condition limitation under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan in
which such Covered Employee or such covered dependent was participating
immediately before he or she became eligible to participate in the New Plan.
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the relevant
Subsidiary of either to provide each Covered Employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time and during the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs under any Company Benefit
Plan in satisfying any applicable co-payment and deductible requirements for
such calendar year under any New Plan in which such Covered Employee
participates after the Effective Time.

(d) Without limiting the scope of Section 8.5, nothing in this Section 5.16
shall confer any rights or remedies of any kind or description upon any
Covered Employee or any other Person other than the Company and Parent and
their respective successors and assigns. 

(e) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall refrain from causing any
employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to suffer an "employment
loss" as defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of
1988 or any similar state or local law (collectively, the " _WARN Act_ "), in
the ninety (90) days prior to the Effective Time, without the prior consent
of Parent. Notwithstanding Section 5.10 of this Agreement, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall cooperate with and provide
reasonable assistance to Parent or its agents in preparing and delivering any
notices required or potentially required pursuant to the WARN Act (as
determined by Parent in its sole discretion) to effectuate the termination of
the employment of any employees of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries as
of the Effective Time in compliance with the WARN Act; _provided_ , _however_
, that all such notices shall indicate that the terminations of employment are
contingent upon the consummation of the Merger.

Section 5.17 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any dispositions of
Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company
Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with
respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, such efforts to include all steps required be taken in
accordance with the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC
to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.

Section 5.18 _Development Drugs_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, in the ordinary course,
the Development Drugs; _provided_ , that, with respect to (i) Supprelin,
Parents obligations under this Section 5.18 shall terminate on the third
anniversary of the Effective Time and (ii) with respect to the Stent and
Octreotide, Parents obligations under this Section 5.18 shall terminate on
the fifth  



 

63  anniversary of the Effective Date. For the purposes of this Section 5.18,
"commercially reasonable efforts" shall mean efforts and resources normally
used by Parent for a product owned by it or to which it has exclusive rights,
which is of similar market potential at a similar stage in its development or
product life, taking into account issues of safety and efficacy,
product profile, competitiveness of the marketplace, the proprietary position
of the compound or product, the regulatory and reimbursement structure
involved, the profitability of the applicable products, and other relevant
factors.

Section 5.19 _State Takeover Laws_. If any state takeover Law becomes
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company and their respective boards of
directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

conditions to its own obligations. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party by its duly authorized
officer. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any  



 

71  of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights. The waiver of any such right with respect to particular
facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to
any other facts and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

  EXHIBIT 2.1(D)(II)(A)

_Treatment of Company Stock Options I_

With respect to the holders of Company Stock Options to which Section
2.1(d)(ii)(A) applies, if the Contingent Stock Rights granted under any
Contingent Stock Rights Agreement become exercisable, Parent shall issue to
such holder such number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to:

(a) If the Supprelin Contingent Stock Right becomes exercisable, the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such Company Stock Option held
by such holder immediately before the Closing multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
(as defined in the Supprelin Contingent Stock Right Agreement),

(b) If the Stent Contingent Stock Right becomes exercisable, the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such Company Stock Option held
by such holder immediately before the Closing multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
(as defined in the Stent Contingent Stock Right Agreement),

(c) If the Octreotide Contingent Stock Right becomes exercisable, the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such Company Stock Option
held by such holder immediately before the Closing multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio (as defined in the Octreotide Contingent Stock Right Agreement).

The shares issuable pursuant to Sections (a), (b) and (c) above shall be

defined in the applicable Contingent Stock Right Agreement) for such
Contingent Stock Right.



 

2.1(I)-1 EXHIBIT 2.1(D)(II)(B)

_Treatment of Company Stock Options II_

With respect to the holders of Company Stock Options to which Section
2.1(d)(ii)(B) applies, if the Contingent Stock Rights granted under any
Contingent Stock Rights Agreement become exercisable, Parent shall issue to
such holder such number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to:

_(A) x (B)_

__(C) 

Where:



     |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|--- 
  (A) |  | = |  | the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to each such Company Stock Option held by such holder immediately
before the Closing; 
   |  | 
  (B) |  | = |  | the excess, if any, of (1) the Aggregate
Cumulative Value of the Contingent Stock Rights over (2) the sum of (i) the
Underwater Amount and (ii) the aggregate of any prior excesses of Aggregate
Cumulative Value of the Contingent Stock Rights over the Underwater Amount
resulting from the achievement of any Milestone Dates (as defined in the
applicable Contingent Stock Rights Agreement) with respect to any
other Contingent Stock Rights; and 
   |  | 
  (C) |  | = |  | the Current Stock Price (as defined in the
applicable Contingent Stock Rights Agreement). 
 

The " _Aggregate Cumulative Value of the Contingent Stock Rights_ " shall mean
the sum, as determined on the applicable Milestone Date (as defined in the
applicable Contingent Stock Rights Agreement) for any Contingent Stock Right,
of (a) the value of the Contingent Stock Right giving rise to the Milestone
Date plus (b) the value of each other Contingent Stock Right that has become
exercisable prior to such Milestone Date1.

The " _Underwater Amount_ " shall mean the excess of (x) the per-share
exercise price of a Company Stock Option to which Section 2.1(d)(ii)(B)
applies over (y) $7.75.

* * *

   1 | For example, in the event the Supprelin Contingent Stock Right
becomes payable, the Aggregate Cumulative Value of the Contingent Stock Rights
on such date shall equal $1.00. If, subsequent to the date the Supprelin
Contingent Stock Right becomes payable, the Octreotide Contingent Stock Right
becomes payable, the Aggregate Cumulative Value of the Contingent Stock Rights
on the date the Octreotide Contingent Stock Right becomes payable shall equal
$2.50. If, subsequent to the date the Stent Contingent Stock Right becoming
payable, the Stent Contingent Stock Right becomes payable, the Aggregate Value
of the Phantom Contingent Stock Rights shall equal $3.50. 
---|--- 



 

2.1(II)-1 The shares issuable pursuant to the formula set forth on this _Schedule B_ or
any portion thereof, shall be issuable within ten (10) days following the
applicable Milestone Date.

No shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issuable with respect to any Company
Stock Option unless the Aggregate Cumulative Value of the Contingent Stock
Rights at such date exceeds the Underwater Amount.

_Example_

_Supprelin_

Assume Holder holds Company Stock Options to purchase 100 shares of Company
Common Stock at $10.00 per share. The Underwater Amount equals $2.25.

Assume Supprelin Contingent Stock Right ($1.00 value) becomes payable and the
Current Stock Price equals $6.00.

Holder would be entitled to receive the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to: 

[(100 x ($1.00-$2.25))/$6.00] = 0 shares

_Octreotide_

Assume further that Octreotide Contingent Stock Right ($1.50 value) later
becomes payable and the Current Stock Price equals $6.00.

Holder would be entitled to receive the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to:

[(100 x ($2.50-$2.25))/$6.00] = 4 shares (plus payment in cash equal to
fractional shares)

_Stent_

Assume further that Stent Contingent Stock Right ($1.00 value) later becomes
payable and the Current Stock Price equals $8.00.

Holder would be entitled to receive the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to:

[(100 x ($3.50-($2.25+$0.25)))/$8.00] = 12 shares (plus payment in cash equal
to fractional shares)
