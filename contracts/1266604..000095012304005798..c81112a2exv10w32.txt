         successor sections or rules adopted by the SEC from time to time;

                  (vii)    references to any statute, law, rule or regulation

         in effect and to any successor statute, law, rule or regulation;

                  (viii)   references to any contract, agreement or instrument
         shall mean the same as amended, modified, supplemented or amended and
         restated from time to time, in each case, in accordance with any
         applicable restrictions contained in this Indenture; and

                  Section 2.01. Form and Dating.

                  (a)      General. The Notes and the Trustee's certificate of
authentication shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 hereto, in the
case of Eight Year Notes, and Exhibit A-2 hereto, in the case of Ten Year Notes.
The Notes may have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock
exchange rule or usage. Each Note shall be dated the date of its authentication.
The Notes shall be in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples thereof.

                           The terms and provisions contained in the Notes shall
constitute, and are hereby expressly made, a part of this Indenture and the
Issuers and the Trustee, by their execution and delivery of this Indenture,
expressly agree to such terms and provisions and to be bound thereby. However,
to the extent any provision of any Note conflicts with the express provisions of
this Indenture, the provisions of this Indenture shall govern and be
controlling.

                  (b)      Global Notes. Eight Year Notes issued in global form
shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 attached hereto (including the
Global Note Legend thereon and the "Schedule of Exchanges of Interests in the
Global Note" attached thereto). Ten Year Notes issued in global form shall be
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 attached hereto (including the Global
Note Legend thereon and the "Schedule of Exchanges of Interests in the Global
Note" attached thereto). Eight Year Notes issued in definitive form shall be
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 attached hereto (but without the Global
Note Legend thereon and without the "Schedule of Exchanges of Interests in the
Global Note" attached thereto). Ten Year Notes issued in definitive form shall
be substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 attached hereto (but without the
Global Notes Legend thereon and without the "Schedule of Exchanges of Interests
in the Global Note" attached thereto). Each Global Note shall represent such of
the outstanding Notes as shall be specified therein and each shall provide that
it shall represent the aggregate principal amount

                                      -29-
<PAGE>

of outstanding Notes from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate
principal amount of outstanding Notes represented thereby may from time to time
be reduced or increased, as appropriate, to reflect exchanges and redemptions.
Any endorsement of a Global Note to reflect the amount of any increase or
decrease in the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes represented
thereby shall be made by the Trustee or the custodian, at the direction of the
Trustee, in accordance with instructions given by the Holder thereof as required
by Section 2.06.

                  (c)      Euroclear and Clearstream Procedures Applicable. The
provisions of the "Operating Procedures of the Euroclear System" and "Terms and
Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear" and the "General Terms and Conditions of
Clearstream" and "Customer Handbook" of Clearstream (or, in each case,
equivalent documents setting forth the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream)
shall be applicable to transfers of beneficial interests in the Regulation S
Global Notes that are held by Participants through Euroclear or Clearstream.

                  Section 2.02. Execution and Authentication.

                           Two Officers shall sign the Notes for each Issuer by
manual or facsimile signature.

                           If an Officer whose signature is on a Note no longer
holds that office at the time a Note is authenticated, the Note shall
nevertheless be valid.

                           A Note shall not be valid until authenticated by the
manual signature (which may be by facsimile) of the Trustee. The signature shall
be conclusive evidence that the Note has been authenticated under this
Indenture.

                           At any time and from time to time after the execution
and delivery of this Indenture, the Issuers may deliver Notes executed by the
Issuers to the Trustee for authentication; and the Trustee shall authenticate
and deliver (i) Initial Eight Year Notes for original issue in the aggregate
principal amount of $1,100,000,000, (ii) Initial Ten Year Notes for original
issue in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000, (iii) Additional Notes
from time to time for original issue in aggregate principal amount specified by
the Issuers, and (iv) Exchange Notes from time to time for issue in exchange for
a like principal amount of Initial Notes or Initial Additional Notes of the same
series, in each case specified in clauses (i) through (iv) above, upon a written
order of the Issuers signed by an Officer of each of the Issuers (an
"Authentication Order"). Such Authentication Order shall specify the amount of
the applicable series of Notes to be authenticated and the date on which the
Notes are to be authenticated, whether such Notes are to be Initial Notes,
Additional Notes or Exchange Notes and whether the Notes are to be issued as one
or more Global Notes and such other information as the Issuers may include or
the Trustee may reasonably request. The aggregate principal amount of Notes
which may be authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is unlimited.

                           On the Issue Date, the Issuers will issue
$1,100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Initial Eight Year Notes and
$400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Initial Ten Year Notes. Initial Notes
and any Initial Additional Notes offered and sold in reliance on the exemption
from registration under the Securities Act provided by Section 4(2) thereunder
or Rule 144A shall be issued as one or more Rule 144A Global Notes. Initial
Notes and any Initial Additional Notes offered and sold in offshore transactions
in reliance on Regulation S shall be issued as one or more Regulation S Global
Notes.

                           The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent
acceptable to the Issuers to authenticate Notes. An authenticating agent may
authenticate Notes whenever the Trustee may do so. Each

                                      -30-

<PAGE>

reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes
authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as an
Agent to deal with Holders or an Affiliate of the Issuers.

                  Section 2.03. Registrar and Paying Agent.

                           The Issuers shall maintain an office or agency where
Notes may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange
("Registrar") and an office or agency where Notes may be presented for payment
("Paying Agent"). The Registrar shall keep a register of the Notes and of their
transfer and exchange. The Issuers may appoint one or more co-registrars and one
or more additional paying agents. The term "Registrar" includes any co-registrar
and the term "Paying Agent" includes any additional paying agent. The Issuers
may change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice to any Holder. The
Issuers shall notify the Trustee in writing of the name and address of any Agent
not a party to this Indenture. If the Issuers fail to appoint or maintain
another entity as Registrar or Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such. The
Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar.

                           The Issuers initially appoint The Depository Trust
Company ("DTC") to act as Depositary with respect to the Global Notes.

                           The Issuers initially appoint the Trustee to act as
the Registrar and Paying Agent and to act as Custodian with respect to the
Global Notes.

                  Section 2.04. Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust.

                           The Issuers shall require each Paying Agent other
than the Trustee to agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust
for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for
the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, and shall
notify the Trustee of any default by the Issuers in making any such payment.
While any such default continues, the Trustee may require a Paying Agent to pay
all money held by it to the Trustee. The Issuers at any time may require a
Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. Upon payment over to
the Trustee, the Paying Agent (if other than the Company or a Subsidiary) shall
have no further liability for the money. If the Company or a Subsidiary acts as
Paying Agent, it shall segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the
benefit of the Holders all money held by it as Paying Agent. Upon any bankruptcy
or reorganization proceedings relating to the Issuers, the Trustee shall serve
as Paying Agent for the Notes.

                  Section 2.05. Holder Lists.

                           The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is
reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and
addresses of all Holders and shall otherwise comply with TIA Section 312(a). If
the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Issuers shall furnish to the Trustee at
least seven Business Days before each interest payment date and at such other
times as the Trustee may request in writing, a list in such form and as of such
date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of the
Holders and the Issuers shall otherwise comply with TIA Section 312(a).

                  Section 2.06. Transfer and Exchange.

                  (a)      Transfer and Exchange of Global Notes. A Global Note
may not be transferred as a whole except by the Depositary to a nominee of the
Depositary, by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or to another
nominee of the Depositary, or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a
successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary. All Global Notes
shall be exchanged by the Issuers for Definitive Notes of the applicable series
if:

                                      -31-
<PAGE>

                  (i)      the Issuers deliver to the Trustee notice from the
         Depositary that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
         Depositary or that it is no longer a clearing agency registered under
         the Exchange Act and, in either case, a successor Depositary is not
         appointed by the Issuers within 120 days after the date of such notice
         from the Depositary; or

                  (ii)     there shall have occurred and be continuing a Default
         or Event of Default with respect to the Notes.

                           Upon the occurrence of any of the preceding events
referenced in clause (i) or (ii) above, Definitive Notes shall be issued in such
names as the Depositary shall instruct the Trustee. Global Notes also may be
exchanged or replaced, in whole or in part, as provided in Sections 2.07 and
2.10. Every Note authenticated and delivered in exchange for, or in lieu of, a
Global Note or any portion thereof, pursuant to this Section 2.06 or Section
2.07 or 2.10, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be,
a Global Note. A Global Note may not be exchanged for another Note other than as
provided in this Section 2.06(a); provided, however, that beneficial interests
in a Global Note may be transferred and exchanged as provided in Section
2.06(b), (c) or (f).

                  (b)      Transfer and Exchange of Beneficial Interests in the
Global Notes. The transfer and exchange of beneficial interests in the Global
Notes shall be effected through the Depositary, in accordance with the
provisions of this Indenture and the Applicable Procedures. Beneficial interests
in the Restricted Global Notes shall be subject to restrictions on transfer
comparable to those set forth herein to the extent required by the Securities
Act. Prior to the expiration of the 40-day distribution compliance period set
forth in Regulation S, beneficial interests in any Regulation S Global Notes may
be held only through Euroclear or Clearstream unless transferred in accordance
with Section 2.06(b)(iii). Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes
also shall require compliance with either subparagraph (i) or (ii) below, as
applicable, as well as one or more of the other following subparagraphs, as
applicable:

                  (i)      Transfer of Beneficial Interests in the Same Global
         Note. Beneficial interests in any Restricted Global Note may be
         transferred to Persons who take delivery thereof in the form of a
         beneficial interest in the same Restricted Global Note in accordance
         with the transfer restrictions set forth in the Private Placement
         Legend. Beneficial interests in any Unrestricted Global Note may be
         transferred to Persons who take delivery thereof in the form of a
         beneficial interest in an Unrestricted Global Note of the same series.
         No written orders or instructions shall be required to be delivered to
         the Registrar to effect the transfers described in this Section
         2.06(b)(i).

                  (ii)     All Other Transfers and Exchanges of Beneficial
         Interests in Global Notes. In connection with all transfers and
         exchanges of beneficial interests that are not subject to Section
         2.06(b)(i) above, the transferor of such beneficial interest must
         deliver to the Registrar either:

                           (A)      a written order from a Participant or an
                  Indirect Participant given to the Depositary in accordance
                  with the Applicable Procedures directing the Depositary to
                  credit or cause to be credited a beneficial interest in
                  another Global Note of the same series in an amount equal to
                  the beneficial interest to be transferred or exchanged; and

                           (B)      instructions given in accordance with the
                  Applicable Procedures containing information regarding the
                  Participant account to be credited with such increase; or

                           (C)      a written order from a Participant or an
                  Indirect Participant given to the Depositary in accordance
                  with the Applicable Procedures directing the Depositary to
                  cause to be issued a Definitive Note of the same series in an
                  amount equal to the beneficial interest to be transferred or
                  exchanged; and

                                      -32-
<PAGE>
                           (D)      instructions given by the Depositary to the
                  Registrar containing information regarding the Person in whose
                  name such Definitive Note shall be registered to effect the
                  transfer or exchange referred to in subparagraph (A) above.

         Upon consummation of an Exchange Offer by the Issuers in accordance
         with Section 2.06(f), the requirements of this Section 2.06(b)(ii)
         shall be deemed to have been satisfied upon receipt by the Registrar of
         the instructions contained in the Letter of Transmittal delivered by
         the holder of such beneficial interests in the Restricted Global Notes.
         Upon satisfaction of all of the requirements for transfer or exchange
         of beneficial interests in Global Notes contained in this Indenture and
         the Notes or otherwise applicable under the Securities Act, the Trustee
         shall adjust the principal amount of the relevant Global Note(s)
         pursuant to Section 2.06(h).

                           (iii)    Transfer of Beneficial Interests to Another
                  Restricted Global Note. A beneficial interest in any
                  Restricted Global Note may be transferred to a Person who
                  takes delivery thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in
                  another Restricted Global Note of the same series if the
                  transfer complies with the requirements of Section 2.06(b)(ii)
                  above and the Registrar receives the following:

                                    (A)      if the transferee will take
                           delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the
                           Rule 144A Global Note of the same series, then the
                           transferor must deliver a certificate in the form of
                           Exhibit B hereto, including the certifications in
                           item (1) thereof; and

                                    (B)      if the transferee will take
                           delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in the
                           Regulation S Global Note of the same series, then the
                           transferor must deliver a certificate in the form of
                           Exhibit B hereto, including the certifications in
                           item (2) thereof.

                           (iv)     Transfer and Exchange of Beneficial
                  Interests in a Restricted Global Note for Beneficial Interests
                  in an Unrestricted Global Note. A beneficial interest in any
                  Restricted Global Note may be exchanged by any holder thereof
                  for a beneficial interest in an Unrestricted Global Note of
                  the same series or transferred to a Person who takes delivery
                  thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in an
                  Unrestricted Global Note of the same series if the exchange or
                  transfer complies with the requirements of Section 2.06(b)(ii)
                  above and:

                                    (A)      such exchange or transfer is
                           effected pursuant to an Exchange Offer in accordance
                           with a Registration Rights Agreement and the holder
                           of the beneficial interest to be transferred, in the
                           case of an exchange, or the transferee, in the case
                           of a transfer, certifies in the applicable Letter of
                           Transmittal that it is not (1) a broker-dealer, (2) a
                           Person participating in the distribution of the
                           relevant Exchange Notes or (3) a Person who is an
                           affiliate (as defined in Rule 144) of the Issuers;

                                    (B)      such transfer is effected pursuant
                           to a Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with
                           a Registration Rights Agreement;

                                    (C)      such transfer is effected by a
                           broker-dealer pursuant to the Exchange Offer
                           Registration Statement in accordance with a
                           Registration Rights Agreement;

                                    (D)      such exchange or transfer (i) is
                           effected after the expiration of the 40-day
                           distribution compliance period set forth in
                           Regulation S or (ii) is (and together with any
                           subsequent transfer would be) effected pursuant to an
                           exemption from registration under the Securities Act
                           provided by Rule 144 and the Registrar receives the
                           following:

                                      -33-
<PAGE>

                                              (1)   if the holder of such
                                    beneficial interest in a Restricted Global

                                    interest for a beneficial interest in an
                                    Unrestricted Global Note of the same series,
                                    a certificate from such holder in the form

                           (D), if the Registrar so requests or if the

                           Unrestricted Definitive Note of the same series, a
                           certificate from such Holder in the form of Exhibit B
                           hereto, including the certifications in item (4)
                           thereof;

                  and, in each such case set forth in this subparagraph (D), if
                  the Registrar so requests, an Opinion of Counsel in form
                  reasonably acceptable to the Issuers to the effect that such
                  exchange or transfer is in compliance with the Securities Act
                  and that the restrictions on transfer contained herein and in
                  the Private Placement Legend are no longer required in order
                  to maintain compliance with the Securities Act; or

                           (E)      such exchange or transfer is effected
                  pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
                  Securities Act.

                  (iii)    Unrestricted Definitive Notes to Unrestricted
         Definitive Notes. A Holder of Unrestricted Definitive Notes may
         transfer such Notes to a Person who takes delivery thereof in the form
         of an Unrestricted Definitive Note of the same series. Upon receipt of
         a request to register such a transfer, the Registrar shall register the
         Unrestricted Definitive Notes pursuant to the instructions from the
         Holder thereof.

                  (f)      Exchange Offer. Upon the occurrence of an Exchange
Offer in accordance with a Registration Rights Agreement, the Issuers shall
issue and, upon receipt of an Authentication Order in accordance with Section
2.02, the Trustee shall authenticate (i) one or more Unrestricted Global Notes
in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the beneficial
interests in the Restricted Global Notes of the same series tendered for
acceptance by Persons that certify in the applicable Letters of Transmittal that
(x) they are not broker-dealers, (y) they are not participating in a
distribution of the relevant Exchange Notes and (z) they are not affiliates (as
defined in Rule 144) of the Issuers, and accepted for exchange in the relevant
Exchange Offer and (ii) Definitive Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal
to the principal amount of the Restricted Definitive Notes of the same series
accepted for exchange in the relevant Exchange Offer. Concurrently with the
issuance of such Notes, the Trustee shall cause the aggregate principal amount
of the applicable Restricted Global Notes to be reduced accordingly, and the
Issuers shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the
Persons designated by the Holders of Definitive Notes so accepted Definitive
Notes of the same series in the appropriate principal amount.

                  (g)      Legends. The following legends shall appear on the
face of all Global Notes and Definitive Notes issued under this Indenture unless
specifically stated otherwise in the applicable provisions of this Indenture.

                  (i)      Private Placement Legend.

                  (A)      Except as permitted by subparagraph (B) below, each
         Global Note and each Definitive Note (and all Notes issued in exchange
         therefor or substitution thereof) shall bear the legend in
         substantially the following form:

                  "THE NOTES EVIDENCED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
                  UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE "SECURITIES ACT")

                  (b) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE
                  STATES OF THE UNITED STATES."

                  (B)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Global Note or
         Definitive Note issued pursuant to subparagraph (b)(iv), (c)(ii),
         (c)(iii), (d)(ii), (d)(iii), (e)(ii), (e)(iii) or (f) of this Section
         2.06 (and all Notes issued in exchange therefor or substitution
         thereof) shall not bear the Private Placement Legend.

                  (ii)     Global Note Legend. Each Global Note shall bear a
         legend in substantially the following form:

                  "THIS GLOBAL NOTE IS HELD BY THE DEPOSITARY (AS DEFINED IN THE
                  INDENTURE GOVERNING THIS NOTE) OR ITS NOMINEE IN CUSTODY FOR
                  THE BENEFIT OF THE BENEFICIAL OWNERS HEREOF, AND IS NOT
                  TRANSFERABLE TO ANY PERSON UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEPT THAT
                  (i) THE TRUSTEE MAY MAKE SUCH NOTATIONS HEREON AS MAY BE
                  REQUIRED PURSUANT TO SECTION 2.06 OF THE INDENTURE, (ii) THIS
                  GLOBAL NOTE MAY BE EXCHANGED IN WHOLE BUT NOT IN PART PURSUANT
                  TO SECTION 2.06(a) OF THE INDENTURE, (iii) THIS GLOBAL NOTE
                  MAY BE DELIVERED TO THE TRUSTEE FOR CANCELLATION PURSUANT TO
                  SECTION 2.11 OF THE INDENTURE AND (iv) THIS GLOBAL NOTE MAY BE
                  TRANSFERRED TO A SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY WITH THE PRIOR WRITTEN
                  CONSENT OF THE ISSUERS."

                  (iii)    Regulation S Legend. Each temporary Regulation S
         Global Note should bear a legend in substantially the following form:

                  "THE ISSUERS HAVE REQUESTED THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY NOT
                  TO TRANSFER ANY INTEREST IN THIS GLOBAL NOTE BY EFFECTING
                  BOOK-ENTRY DELIVERIES UNTIL JUNE 6, 2004."

                  (h)      Cancellation and/or Adjustment of Global Notes. At
such time as all beneficial interests in a particular Global Note have been
exchanged for Definitive Notes or a particular Global Note has been redeemed,
repurchased or canceled in whole and not in part, each such Global Note shall be
returned to or retained and canceled by the Trustee in accordance with Section
2.11. At any time prior to such cancellation, if any beneficial interest in a
Global Note is exchanged for or transferred to a Person who will take delivery
thereof in the form of a beneficial interest in another Global Note or for
Definitive Notes, the principal amount of Notes represented by such Global Note
shall be reduced accordingly and an endorsement shall be made on such Global
Note by the Trustee or by the Depositary at the direction of the Trustee to
reflect such reduction; and if the beneficial interest is being exchanged for or
transferred to a Person who will take delivery thereof in the form of a
beneficial interest in another Global Note, such

                                      -41-
<PAGE>

other Global Note shall be increased accordingly and an endorsement shall be
made on such Global Note by the Trustee or by the Depositary at the direction of
the Trustee to reflect such increase.

         (i)      General Provisions Relating to Transfers and Exchanges.

                  (i)      To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges,
the Issuers shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate Global Notes and
Definitive Notes upon the Issuers' order or at the Registrar's request.

                  (ii)     No service charge shall be made to a holder of a
beneficial interest in a Global Note or to a Holder of a Definitive Note for any
registration of transfer or exchange, but the Issuers may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable
in connection therewith (other than any such transfer taxes or similar
governmental charge payable upon exchange or transfer pursuant to Sections 2.10,
3.09, 4.11, 4.16 and 9.05).

                  (iii)    The Registrar shall not be required to register the
transfer of or exchange any Note selected for redemption in whole or in part,
except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part.

                  (iv)     All Global Notes and Definitive Notes issued upon any
registration of transfer or exchange of Global Notes or Definitive Notes shall
be the valid obligations of the Issuers, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Global Notes or Definitive
Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

                  (v)      The Issuers shall not be required to register the
transfer of or to exchange a Note for a period of 15 days immediately preceding
the redemption of a Note or between a record date and the next succeeding
interest payment date.

                  (vi)     Prior to due presentment for the registration of a
transfer of any Note, the Trustee, any Agent and the Issuers may deem and treat
the Person in whose name any Note is registered as the absolute owner of such
Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and interest on such
Notes and for all other purposes, and none of the Trustee, any Agent or the
Issuers shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

                  (vii)    The Trustee shall authenticate Global Notes and
Definitive Notes in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.02.

                  (viii)   All certifications, certificates and Opinions of
Counsel required to be submitted to the Registrar pursuant to this Section 2.06
to effect a registration of transfer or exchange may be submitted by facsimile.

                  Section 2.07. Replacement Notes.

                           If any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee
or the Issuers and the Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction of the
destruction, loss or theft of any Note, the Issuers shall issue and the Trustee,
upon receipt of an Authentication Order, shall authenticate a replacement Note
if the Trustee's requirements are met. If required by the Trustee or the
Issuers, an indemnity bond must be supplied by the Holder that is sufficient in
the judgment of the Trustee and the Issuers to protect the Issuers, the Trustee,
any Agent and any authenticating agent from any loss that any of them may suffer
if a Note is replaced. The Issuers may charge for their expenses in replacing a
Note.

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

                           Every replacement Note is an additional legally
binding obligation of the Issuers and shall be entitled to all of the benefits
of this Indenture equally and proportionately with all other Notes duly issued
hereunder.

                  Section 2.08. Outstanding Notes.

                           The Notes outstanding at any time are all the Notes
authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to
it for cancellation, those reductions in the interest in a Global Note effected
by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, and those
described in this Section 2.08 as not outstanding. Except as set forth in
Section 2.09, a Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an
Affiliate of the Company holds the Note.

                           If a Note is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07, it
ceases to be outstanding unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it
that the replaced Note is held by a bona fide purchaser.

                           If the principal amount of any Note is considered
paid under Section 4.01, it ceases to be outstanding and interest on it ceases
to accrue.

                           If the Paying Agent (other than an Issuer, a
Subsidiary or an Affiliate of any thereof) holds, on a redemption date or
maturity date, money sufficient to pay Notes payable on that date, then on and
after that date such Notes shall be deemed to be no longer outstanding and shall
cease to accrue interest.

                  Section 2.09. Treasury Notes.

                           In determining whether the Holders of the required
principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent,
Notes owned by an Issuer, or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or
controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with an Issuer, shall
be considered as though not outstanding, except that for the purposes of
determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such
direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that a Responsible Officer of the
Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.

                  Section 2.10. Temporary Notes.

                           Until certificates representing Notes are ready for
delivery, the Issuers may prepare and the Trustee, upon receipt of an
Authentication Order, shall authenticate temporary Notes. Temporary Notes shall
be substantially in the form of certificated Notes but may have variations that
the Issuers consider appropriate for temporary Notes and as shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee. Without unreasonable delay, the Issuers shall prepare
and the Trustee shall authenticate definitive Notes in exchange for temporary
Notes of the same series.

                           Holders of temporary Notes shall be entitled to all
of the benefits of this Indenture.

                  Section 2.11. Cancellation.

                           The Issuers at any time may deliver Notes to the
Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and Paying Agent shall forward to the
Trustee any Notes surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or
payment. The Trustee and no one else shall cancel all Notes surrendered for
registration of transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and
shall dispose of such canceled

                                      -43-
<PAGE>

Notes in its customary manner. The Issuers may not issue new Notes to replace
Notes that they have paid or that have been delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation.

                  Section 2.12. Defaulted Interest.

                           If the Issuers default in a payment of interest on
the Notes, they shall pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to
the extent lawful, interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons
who are Holders on a subsequent special record date, in each case at the rate
provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01. The Issuers shall notify the Trustee
in writing of the amount of defaulted interest proposed to be paid on each Note
and the date of the proposed payment. The Issuers shall fix or cause to be fixed
each such special record date and payment date; provided, however, that no such
special record date shall be less than 10 days prior to the related payment date
for such defaulted interest. At least 15 days before the special record date,
the Issuers (or, upon the written request of the Issuers, the Trustee in the
name and at the expense of the Issuers) shall mail or cause to be mailed to
Holders a notice that states the special record date, the related payment date
and the amount of such interest to be paid.

                            REDEMPTION AND PREPAYMENT

                  Section 3.01. Notices to Trustee.

                           If the Issuers elect to redeem Notes pursuant to the
optional redemption provisions of Section 3.07, they shall furnish to the
Trustee, at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a redemption date, an
Officers' Certificate setting forth (i) the paragraph of the Notes and/or the
clause of this Indenture pursuant to which the redemption shall occur, (ii) the
redemption date, (iii) the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed and (iv) the
redemption price.

                  Section 3.02. Selection of Notes to Be Redeemed.

                           If less than all of the Eight Year Notes or Ten Year
Notes, as the case may be, are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee shall
select the Notes of that series to be redeemed or purchased among the Holders of
the Notes of that series as follows:

         (a)      in compliance with the requirements of the principal national
         securities exchange, if any, on which such Notes are listed; or

         (b)      if such Notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot
         or in accordance with any other method the Trustee shall deem fair and
         appropriate.

In the event of partial redemption by lot, the particular Notes to be redeemed
shall be selected, unless otherwise provided herein, not less than 30 nor more
than 60 days prior to the redemption date by the Trustee from the outstanding
Notes not previously called for redemption.

                           The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuers in
writing of the Notes selected for redemption and, in the case of any Note
selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
Notes and portions of Notes selected shall be in amounts of $1,000 or whole
multiples of $1,000; except that if all of the Notes of a Holder are to be
redeemed, the entire outstanding amount of Notes held by such Holder, even if
not a multiple of $1,000, shall be redeemed. Except as provided in the preceding
sentence, provisions of this Indenture that apply to Notes called for redemption
also apply to portions of Notes called for redemption.

                  Section 3.03. Notice of Redemption.

                           Subject to the provisions of Section 3.09, at least
30 days but not more than 60 days before a redemption date, the Issuers shall
mail or cause to be mailed, by first class mail, a notice of redemption to each
Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered address.

                           The notice shall identify the Notes to be redeemed
and shall state:

                  (a)      the redemption date;

                  (b)      the redemption price;

                  (c)      if any Note is being redeemed in part, the portion of
         the principal amount of such Note to be redeemed and that, after the
         redemption date upon surrender of such Note, a new Note or Notes in
         principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion shall be issued upon
         cancellation of the original Note;

                  (d)      the name and address of the Paying Agent;

                  (e)      that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered
         to the Paying Agent to collect the redemption price;

                  (f)      that, unless the Issuers default in making such
         redemption payment, interest on Notes called for redemption, or if any
         Note is being redeemed only in part, interest on a portion of the
         principal amount of such Note to be redeemed, ceases to accrue on and
         after the redemption date;

                  (g)      the paragraph of the Notes and/or Section of this
         Indenture pursuant to which the Notes called for redemption are being
         redeemed; and

                  (h)      that no representation is made as to the correctness
         or accuracy of the CUSIP number, if any, listed in such notice or
         printed on the Notes.

                           At the Issuers' request, the Trustee shall give the
notice of redemption in the Issuers' name and at their expense; provided,
however, that each of the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee, at least
45 days prior to the redemption date, an Officers' Certificate requesting that
the Trustee give such notice and setting forth the information to be stated in
such notice as provided in the preceding paragraph.

                  Section 3.04. Effect of Notice of Redemption.

                           Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance
with Section 3.03, Notes called for redemption, or if any Note is being redeemed
only in part, the portion of the principal amount of such Note to be redeemed,
become irrevocably due and payable on the redemption date at the redemption
price. A notice of redemption may not be conditional.

                  Section 3.05. Deposit of Redemption Price.

                           At or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the
redemption date, the Issuers shall deposit with the Trustee or with the Paying
Agent money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on
all Notes to be redeemed on that date. The Trustee or the Paying Agent shall

                                      -45-
<PAGE>

promptly return to the Issuers any money deposited with the Trustee or the
Paying Agent by the Issuers in excess of the amounts necessary to pay the
redemption price of, and accrued interest on, all Notes to be redeemed.

                           If the Issuers comply with the provisions of the
preceding paragraph, on and after the redemption date, interest shall cease to
accrue on the Notes or the portions of Notes called for redemption. If a Note is
redeemed on or after an interest record date but on or prior to the related
interest payment date, then any accrued and unpaid interest shall be paid to the
Person in whose name such Note was registered at the close of business on such
record date. If any Note called for redemption shall not be so paid upon
surrender for redemption because of the failure of the Issuers to comply with
the preceding paragraph, interest shall be paid on the unpaid principal, from
the redemption date until such principal is paid, and to the extent lawful on
any interest not paid on such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate
provided in the Notes and in Section 4.01.

                  Section 3.06. Notes Redeemed in Part.

                           Upon surrender of a Note that is redeemed in part,
the Issuers shall issue and, upon the Issuers' written request, the Trustee
shall authenticate for the Holder at the expense of the Issuers a new Note of
the same series equal in principal amount to the unredeemed portion of the Note
surrendered.

                  Section 3.07. Optional Redemption.

                  (a)      Except as set forth in clause (b) of this Section
3.07, the Issuers shall not have the option to redeem the Ten Year Notes prior
to April 30, 2009. Thereafter, the Issuers shall have the option to redeem the
Ten Year Notes, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60
days' notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal
amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning
on April 30 of the years indicated below:

                           If the Purchase Date is on or after an interest
record date and on or before the related interest payment date, any accrued and
unpaid interest shall be paid to the Person in whose name a Note is registered
at the close of business on such record date, and no Special Interest shall be
payable to Holders who tender Notes pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer.

         to the Issuers, a depositary, if appointed by the Issuers, or a Paying
         Agent at the address specified in the notice at least three days before
         the Purchase Date;

                  (g)      that Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their
         election if the Issuers, the depositary or the Paying Agent, as the
         case may be, receives, not later than the expiration of the Offer
         Period, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting
         forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Note the
         Holder delivered for purchase and a statement that such Holder is
         withdrawing his election to have such Note purchased;

                  (h)      that, if the aggregate principal amount of Notes
         surrendered by Holders exceeds the Offer Amount, the Issuers shall
         select the Notes to be purchased on a pro rata basis (with such
         adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the Issuers so that only
         Notes in denominations of $1,000, or integral multiples thereof, shall
         be purchased); and

                  (i)      that Holders whose Notes were purchased only in part
         shall be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased
         portion of the Notes surrendered (or transferred by book-entry
         transfer).

                           On or before the Purchase Date, the Issuers shall, to
the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent
necessary, the Offer Amount of Notes or portions thereof tendered pursuant to
the Asset Sale Offer or if less than the Offer Amount has been tendered, all
Notes tendered, and shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate
stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the
Issuers in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.09. The Issuers, the
Depositary or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall promptly (but in any
case not later than five days after the Purchase Date) mail or deliver to each
tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes tendered by
such Holder and accepted by the Issuers for purchase, and the Issuers shall
promptly issue a new Note of the same series, and the Trustee, upon written
request from the Issuers, shall authenticate and mail or deliver such new Note
to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any

                                      -48-

                           The Issuers shall pay or cause to be paid the
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the dates and in the
manner provided in the Notes. Principal, premium, if any, and interest shall be
considered paid on the date due if the Paying Agent, if other than the Issuers
or a Subsidiary thereof, holds as of 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the due
date money deposited by the Issuers in immediately available funds and
designated for and sufficient to pay all principal, premium, if any, and
interest then due. The Issuers shall pay all Special Interest, if any, in the
same manner on the dates and in the amounts set forth in any Registration Rights
Agreement.

                           The Issuers shall pay interest (including
post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on overdue
principal at the rate equal to 2% per annum in excess of the then applicable
interest rate on the Notes to the extent lawful; they shall pay interest
(including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on
overdue installments of interest (without regard to any applicable grace period)
at the same rate to the extent lawful.

                  Section 4.02. Maintenance of Office or Agency.

                           The Issuers shall maintain in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency (which may be an office of
the Trustee or an Affiliate of the Trustee, Registrar or co-registrar) where
Notes may be surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange and where
notices and demands to or upon the Issuers in respect of the Notes and this
Indenture may be served. The Issuers shall give prompt written notice to the
Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or
agency. If at any time the Issuers shall fail to maintain any such required
office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof,
such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the
Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.

                           The Issuers may also from time to time designate one
or more other offices or agencies where the Notes may be presented or
surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such
designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in
any manner relieve the Issuers of their obligation to maintain an office or
agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York for such purposes. The
Issuers shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation
or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or
agency.

                           The Issuers hereby designate Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,
at Corporate Trust Services, MAC N9303-120, Sixth Street and Marquette Avenue,

shall furnish to the Holders, within the time periods that such information
would have otherwise been required to have been provided to the Commission if
the rules and regulations applicable to the filing of such information were

         constitute part of the Collateral; and

                  (2)      all current reports that would be required to be

as Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual financial
information required by the preceding paragraph shall include a reasonably
detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the
footnotes thereto, and in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, of the financial condition and results of
operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the
financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries

                           In addition, the Issuers shall cause a copy of all of
the information and reports referred to in clauses (1) and (2) above to be

the Company will furnish to the Holders and to securities analysts and
prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be

preceding fiscal year have been made under the supervision of the signing
Officers with a view to determining whether the Issuers have kept, observed,
performed and fulfilled their obligations under this Indenture, and further
stating, as to each such Officer signing such certificate, that to the best of
his or her knowledge the Issuers have kept, observed, performed and fulfilled
each and every covenant

observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Indenture (or,
if a Default or Event of Default shall have occurred, describing all such
Defaults or Events of Default of which he or she may have knowledge and what
action the Issuers are taking or propose to take with respect thereto) and that

existence by reason of which payments on account of the principal of or
interest, if any, on the Notes is prohibited or if such event has occurred, a
description of the event and what action the Issuers are taking or propose to
take with respect thereto.

recommendations of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the
annual financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 4.03 above shall be
accompanied by a written statement of the Company's independent public
accountants (each of whom shall be a firm of established national reputation)

statements, nothing has come to their attention that would lead them to believe

or, if any such violation has occurred, specifying the nature and period of
existence thereof, it being understood that such accountants shall not be liable
directly or indirectly to any Person for any failure to obtain knowledge of any
such violation. In the event that, after the Issuers have used their reasonable
best efforts to obtain the written statement of the Company's independent public
accountants required by the provisions of this paragraph, such statement cannot
be obtained, the Issuers shall deliver, in satisfaction of their obligations
under this Section 4.04, an Officers' Certificate (i) certifying that they have
used their reasonable best efforts to obtain such required statement but were
unable to do so and (ii) attaching the written statement of the Company's
accountants that the Company received in lieu thereof.

                  (c)      The Issuers shall, so long as any of the Notes are
outstanding, deliver to the Trustee, forthwith upon any Officer becoming aware
of any Default or Event of Default, an Officers' Certificate specifying such
Default or Event of Default and what action the Issuers are taking or propose to
take with respect thereto.

                           The Company shall pay, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to pay, prior to delinquency, all material taxes, assessments, and

appropriate proceedings or where the failure to effect such payment is not
adverse in any material respect to the Holders.

                           Each of the Issuers covenants (to the extent that it
may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any
manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension
or usury law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, that may
affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and each of the
Issuers (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all
benefit or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it shall not, by resort
to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein
granted to the Trustee, but shall suffer and permit the execution of every such
power as though no such law has been enacted.

                  Section 4.07. Restricted Payments.

collectively referred to as "Restricted Payments"), unless, at the time of and
after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:

                  (i)      no Default or Event of Default under this Indenture
         shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence
         thereof;

                  (ii)     the Company would, at the time of such Restricted
         Payment and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Restricted

         Indebtedness pursuant to the Leverage Ratio test set forth in the first
         paragraph of Section 4.10; and

                  (iii)    such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate
         amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the Company and its
         Restricted Subsidiaries from and after the Issue Date (excluding

                  plus

                           (b)      an amount equal to 100% of Capital Stock

                           (c)      $100 million.

                           So long as no Default under this Indenture has
occurred and is continuing or would be caused thereby, the preceding provisions
shall not prohibit:

                  (1)      the payment of any dividend within 60 days after the
         date of declaration thereof, if at said date of declaration such
         payment would have complied with the provisions of this Indenture;

                  (2)      regardless of whether a Default then exists, the
         payment of any dividend or distribution made in respect of any calendar
         year or portion thereof during which the Company or any of its
         Subsidiaries is a Person that is not treated as a separate tax paying
         entity for United States federal income tax purposes by the Company and
         its Subsidiaries (directly or indirectly) to the direct or indirect
         holders of the Equity Interests of the Company or its Subsidiaries that
         are Persons that are treated as a separate tax paying entity for United
         States federal income tax purposes, in an amount sufficient to permit
         each such holder to pay the actual income taxes (including required
         estimated tax installments) that are required to be paid by it with
         respect to the taxable income of any Parent (through its direct or
         indirect ownership of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries), the
         Company, its Subsidiaries or any Unrestricted Subsidiary, as
         applicable, in any calendar year, as estimated in good faith by the
         Company or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be;

                  (3)      regardless of whether a Default then exists, the
         payment of any dividend by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company to
         the holders of its common Equity Interests on a pro rata basis;

                  (4)      the payment of any dividend on the Helicon Preferred
         Stock or the redemption, repurchase, retirement or other acquisition of
         the Helicon Preferred Stock in an amount not in excess of its aggregate
         liquidation value;

                  (5)      the repurchase, redemption or other acquisition or
         retirement for value, or the payment of any dividend or distribution to
         the extent necessary to permit the repurchase, redemption or other
         acquisition or retirement for value, of any Equity Interests of the
         Company or a Parent of the Company held by any member of the Company's
         or such Parent's management pursuant to any management equity
         subscription agreement or stock option agreement entered into in
         accordance with the policies of the Company or any Parent; provided,
         however, that the aggregate price paid for all such repurchased,
         redeemed, acquired or retired Equity Interests shall not exceed $10
         million in any fiscal year of the Issuers;

                  (6)      payment of fees in connection with any acquisition,
         merger or similar transaction in an amount that does not exceed an
         amount equal to 1.25% of the transaction value of such acquisition,
         merger or similar transaction; and

                  (7)      additional Restricted Payments directly or indirectly
         to any Parent (i) regardless of whether a Default exists (other than a
         Default under Section 6.01(1), (2), (7) or (8)), for the purpose of
         enabling Charter Holdings, CCOH, CCH II and/or any Charter Refinancing
         Subsidiary to pay interest when due on Indebtedness under the Charter
         Holdings Indentures, the CCOH Indentures, the CCH II Indentures and/or
         any Charter Refinancing Indebtedness, (ii) for the purpose of enabling
         CCI and/or any Charter Refinancing Subsidiary to pay interest when due
         on Indebtedness under the CCI Indentures and/or any Charter Refinancing
         Indebtedness and (iii) so long as the Company would have been
         permitted, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro
         forma effect thereto as if such Restricted Payment had been made at the
         beginning of the applicable quarter period, to incur at least $1.00 of
         additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Leverage Ratio test set forth
         in the first paragraph of Section 4.10, (A) consisting of dividends or
         distributions to the extent required to enable CCH II, Charter
         Holdings, CCI, CCOH or any Charter Refinancing Subsidiary to defease,
         redeem, repurchase, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise acquire or
         retire for value Indebtedness under the CCH II Indentures, the Charter
         Holdings

         Indentures, the CCI Indentures, the CCOH Indentures or any Charter
         Refinancing Indebtedness (including any expenses incurred by any Parent
         in connection therewith) or (B) consisting of purchases, redemptions or
         other acquisitions by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries of
         Indebtedness under the CCH II Indentures, the Charter Holdings
         Indentures, the CCI Indentures, the CCOH Indentures or any Charter
         Refinancing Indebtedness (including any expenses incurred by the
         Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection therewith) and
         the distribution, loan or investment to any Parent of Indebtedness so
         purchased, redeemed or acquired.

                           The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than
cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of the Restricted Payment of
the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the Company
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the Restricted Payment. The
fair market value of any assets or securities that are required to be valued by
this Section 4.07 shall be determined by the Board of Directors of the Company,
whose resolution with respect thereto shall be delivered to the Trustee. Such
Board of Directors' determination must be based upon an opinion or appraisal
issued by an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national
standing if the fair market value exceeds $100 million.

                           Not later than the date of making any Restricted
Payment involving an amount or fair market value in excess of $10 million, the
Issuers shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that such
Restricted Payment is permitted and setting forth the basis upon which the
calculations required by this Section 4.07 were computed, together with a copy
of any fairness opinion or appraisal required by this Indenture.

                  Section 4.08. Investments.

                           The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

                  (1)      make any Restricted Investment; or

                  (2)      allow any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to become an
         Unrestricted Subsidiary, unless, in each case:

                  (a)      no Default or Event of Default under this Indenture
         shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence
         thereof; and

                  (b)      the Company would, at the time of, and after giving
         effect to, such Restricted Investment or such designation of a
         Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, have been
         permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant
         to the Leverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of Section
         4.10.

                           An Unrestricted Subsidiary may be redesignated as a
Restricted Subsidiary if such redesignation would not cause a Default.

                  Section 4.09. Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions
Affecting Subsidiaries.

                           The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, create
or permit to exist or become effective any encumbrance or restriction on the
ability of any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to:

                  (1)      pay dividends or make any other distributions on its
         Capital Stock to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, or
         with respect to any other interest or participation in,

                                      -54-
<PAGE>

         or measured by, its profits, or pay any Indebtedness owed to the
         Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

                  (2)      make loans or advances to the Company or any of its
         Restricted Subsidiaries; or

                  (3)      transfer any of its properties or assets to the
         Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

                           The preceding restrictions shall not apply to
encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:

                  (1)      Existing Indebtedness as in effect on the Issue Date
         (including, without limitation, Indebtedness under any of the Credit
         Facilities) and any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals,
         increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings
         thereof, provided, however, that such amendments, modifications,
         restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
         replacements or refinancings are no more restrictive, taken as a whole,
         with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those
         contained in the most restrictive Existing Indebtedness, as in effect
         on the Issue Date;

                  (2)      this Indenture and the Notes;

                  (3)      applicable law;

                  (4)      any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital
         Stock of a Person acquired by the Company or any of its Restricted
         Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition (except to
         the extent such Indebtedness was incurred in connection with or in
         contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is
         not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any
         Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person,
         so acquired; provided, however, that, in the case of Indebtedness, such
         Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of this Indenture to be
         incurred;

                  (5)      customary non-assignment provisions in leases,
         franchise agreements and other commercial agreements entered into in
         the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices;

                  (6)      purchase money obligations for property acquired in
         the ordinary course of business that impose restrictions on the
         property so acquired of the nature described in clause (3) of the
         preceding paragraph;

                  (7)      any agreement for the sale or other disposition of a
         Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions by such Restricted
         Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition;

                  (8)      Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness; provided,
         however, that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing
         such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness are no more restrictive, taken
         as a whole, than those contained in the agreements governing the
         Indebtedness being refinanced;

                  (9)      Liens securing Indebtedness or other obligations
         otherwise permitted to be incurred under Section 4.14 that limit the
         right of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to dispose
         of the assets subject to such Lien;

                                      -55-
<PAGE>

                  (10)     provisions with respect to the disposition or
         distribution of assets or property in joint venture agreements and
         other similar agreements entered into in the ordinary course of
         business;

                  (11)     restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth
         imposed by customers under contracts entered into in the ordinary
         course of business;

                  (12)     restrictions contained in the terms of Indebtedness
         permitted to be incurred under Section 4.10; provided, however, that
         such restrictions are no more restrictive, taken as a whole, than the
         terms contained in the most restrictive, together or individually, of
         the Credit Facilities as in effect on the Issue Date; and

                  (13)     restrictions that are not materially more
         restrictive, taken as a whole, than customary provisions in comparable
         financings and that the management of the Company determines, at the
         time of such financing, will not materially impair the Issuers' ability
         to make payments as required under the Notes.

                  Section 4.10. Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Preferred Stock.

                           The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue,
assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable,
contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, "incur") any
Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) and the Company shall not issue any
Disqualified Stock and shall not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to
issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock; provided, however,
that the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are Guarantors may
incur Indebtedness, the Company may issue Disqualified Stock and Restricted
Subsidiaries of the Company that are Guarantors may issue Preferred Stock if the
Leverage Ratio of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been
not greater than 4.25 to 1.0 determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro
forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional
Indebtedness had been incurred, or the Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock had
been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of the most recently ended
fiscal quarter. Debt incurred under this paragraph, or once incurred under this
paragraph and subsequently refinanced under clause (5) of the next succeeding
paragraph, is collectively referred to as "Ratio Debt").

                           So long as no Default under this Indenture shall have
occurred and be continuing or would be caused thereby, the first paragraph of
this Section 4.10 shall not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following
items of Indebtedness (collectively, "Permitted Debt"):

                  (1)      the incurrence of Indebtedness under the Credit
         Facilities by (x) the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
         guarantor under the Credit Facilities prior to the Guarantee and Pledge
         Date and (y) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries that are
         Guarantors (or by Subsidiaries that cease to be Guarantors as a result
         of the operation of (i) the first paragraph (a) of Section 11.04 or
         (ii) the second paragraph of clause (a) of Section 11.04 and are no
         longer otherwise obligors with respect to the CCO Credit Facility and
         the Related Obligations, except continuing to secure the Company's
         obligations under the CCO Credit Facility and the Related Obligations
         and the Issuers' obligations with respect to the Notes under Article
         10); provided, however, that the aggregate principal amount of all
         Indebtedness of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding
         under this clause (1) for all Credit Facilities after giving effect to
         such incurrence does not exceed an amount equal to $6.8 billion less
         the aggregate amount of all Net Proceeds from Asset Sales applied by
         the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to repay Indebtedness
         under a Credit Facility pursuant to Section 4.11;

                                      -56-
<PAGE>

                  (2)      the incurrence by the Company and its Restricted
         Subsidiaries of Existing Indebtedness (other than under the Credit
         Facilities);

                  (3)      the incurrence on the Issue Date by the Company and
         its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness represented by the Notes
         (other than any Additional Notes);

                  (4)      the incurrence by the Company or any of its
         Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness represented by Capital Lease
         Obligations, mortgage financings or purchase money obligations, in each
         case, incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of the
         purchase price or cost of construction or improvement (including,
         without limitation, the cost of design, development, construction,
         acquisition, transportation, installation, improvement and migration)
         of Productive Assets of the Company or any of its Restricted
         Subsidiaries, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $75
         million at any time outstanding pursuant to this clause (4);

                  (5)      the incurrence by the Company or any of its
         Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in
         exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to refund,
         refinance or replace, in whole or in part, Indebtedness that was
         permitted by this Indenture to be incurred under this clause (5), the
         first paragraph of this Section 4.10 (but only with respect to such
         first paragraph if by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries that
         are Guarantors) or clause (2) or (3) of this paragraph;

                  (6)      the incurrence by the Company or any of its
         Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany Indebtedness between or among
         the Company and/or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; provided,
         however, that:

                           (a)      if the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of
                  the Company that is a Guarantor is the obligor on such
                  Indebtedness, such Indebtedness must be expressly subordinated
                  to the Notes or the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor on the
                  same terms as such Indebtedness is subordinated to the CCO
                  Credit Facility and the Related Obligations; provided,
                  however, that any such Indebtedness owed to CC VI Operating
                  Company, LLC, CC VIII Operating, LLC or Falcon Cable
                  Communications, LLC, for so long as each is a Restricted
                  Subsidiary of the Company, shall not be required to be so
                  subordinated until the Guarantee and Pledge Date; and

                           (b)      (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of
                  Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness being
                  held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted
                  Subsidiary of the Company and (ii) any sale or other transfer
                  of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is neither the
                  Company nor a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company shall be
                  deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such
                  Indebtedness that was not permitted by this clause (6);

                  (7)      the incurrence by the Company or any of its
         Restricted Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations that are incurred for
         the purpose of fixing, hedging or swapping interest rate risk with
         respect to any floating rate Indebtedness that is permitted by the
         terms of this Indenture to be outstanding;

                  (8)      the guarantee by the Company or any of its Restricted
         Subsidiaries of Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that was
         permitted to be incurred by another provision of this Section 4.10;

<PAGE>

                  (9)      Acquired Debt of a Person that becomes, or is merged
         into, a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; provided,
         however, that (x) such Acquired Debt was not incurred in connection
         with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming, or being merged
         into, a Restricted Subsidiary and (y) the Company would, at the time
         such Person becomes, or is merged into, a Restricted Subsidiary and
         after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such acquisition or merger
         had been made at the beginning of the applicable quarter period, have
         been permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness
         pursuant to the Leverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of
         this Section 4.10;

                  (10)     the incurrence by the Company or any of its
         Restricted Subsidiaries of additional Indebtedness in an aggregate
         principal amount at any time outstanding under this clause (10) not to
         exceed $300 million; and

                  (11)     the accretion or amortization of original issue
         discount and the write-up of Indebtedness in accordance with purchase
         accounting.

                           For purposes of determining compliance with this
Section 4.10, any Indebtedness under Credit Facilities outstanding on the Issue
Date shall be deemed to have been incurred pursuant to clause (1) above and, in
the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness (other than any Indebtedness
initially deemed on the Issue Date to be incurred under clause (1) above) (a)
meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt
described in clauses (1) through (11) above or (b) is entitled to be incurred
pursuant to the first paragraph of this Section 4.10, the Company shall be
permitted to classify and from time to time to reclassify such item of
Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this Section 4.10. Once any item
of Indebtedness is so reclassified, it shall no longer be deemed outstanding
under the category of Permitted Debt, where initially incurred or previously
reclassified. For avoidance of doubt, Indebtedness incurred pursuant to a single
agreement, instrument, program, facility or line of credit may be classified as
Indebtedness arising in part under one of the clauses listed above or under the
first paragraph of this Section 4.10, and in part under any one or more of the
clauses listed above, to the extent that such Indebtedness satisfies the
criteria for such classification.

                           The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, incur,
or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Guarantor to incur, any
Indebtedness which by its contractual terms (or by the contractual terms of any
agreement to which any of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party
governing such Indebtedness) is subordinated in right of payment to any other
Indebtedness of the Company or such Guarantor, unless such Indebtedness is also
by its terms (or by the contractual terms of any agreement to which the Company
or such Guarantor is a party governing such Indebtedness) made expressly
subordinate to the Notes (or relevant Note Guarantee) to the same extent and in
the same manner as such Indebtedness is subordinated to other Indebtedness of
the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be (it being
understood that Indebtedness would not be considered subordinated in right of
payment (i) merely by reason of being secured with a lower-priority Lien, (ii)
if such Indebtedness constitutes Additional Pari Passu Second Priority
Indebtedness or (iii) if such Indebtedness is pari passu in right of payment to
the Notes and subject to an agreement the terms of which are substantially
similar to the intercreditor agreement referred to in Section 7.12.

                           Notwithstanding the foregoing, all Indebtedness
incurred during any Suspension Period shall not be deemed to have been incurred
for the purposes of this Section 4.10, but shall be included in the calculation
of outstanding Indebtedness from and after the next succeeding Reversion Date.

                           The Company shall not pay, or permit its Subsidiaries
to pay, any interest or principal on $361 million of intercompany loans received
by it and its Subsidiaries in November 2003

                                      -58-

from CCO Holdings, all of which shall become a common equity capital
contribution to the Company on the Guarantee and Pledge Date.

                  Section 4.11. Limitation on Asset Sales.

                           The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

                  (1)      the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary receives
         consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair
         market value of the assets or Equity Interests issued or sold or
         otherwise disposed of;

                  (2)      such fair market value is determined by the Board of
         Directors of the Company and evidenced by a resolution of such Board of
         Directors set forth in an Officers' Certificate delivered to the
         Trustee; and

                  (3)      at least 75% of the consideration therefor received
         by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash,
         Cash Equivalents or readily marketable securities.

                           For purposes of this Section 4.11, each of the
following shall be deemed to be cash:

                  (a)      any liabilities (as shown on the Company's or such
         Restricted Subsidiary's most recent balance sheet) of the Company or
         any Restricted Subsidiary thereof (other than contingent liabilities
         and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes) that
         are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to a
         customary novation agreement that releases the Company or such
         Restricted Subsidiary from further liability;

                  (b)      any securities, notes or other obligations received
         by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee
         that are converted by the recipient thereof into cash, Cash Equivalents
         or readily marketable securities within 60 days after receipt thereof
         (to the extent of the cash, Cash Equivalents or readily marketable
         securities received in that conversion); and

                  (c)      Productive Assets.

                           Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds
from an Asset Sale, the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company may
apply an amount equal to such Net Proceeds at its option:

                  (1)      to repay debt under the Credit Facilities (other than
         debt securities issued as part of, or to refinance, a Credit Facility
         that are not Pari Passu First Priority Indebtedness) or other Pari
         Passu First Priority Indebtedness or any other Indebtedness of the
         Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company (other than Indebtedness
         represented solely by a guarantee of a Restricted Subsidiary of the
         Company); or

                  (2)      to invest in Productive Assets; provided, however,
         that any such amount of Net Proceeds which the Company or a Restricted
         Subsidiary has committed to invest in Productive Assets within 365 days
         of the applicable Asset Sale may be invested in Productive Assets
         within two years of such Asset Sale.

                                      -59-
<PAGE>

                           The amount of any Net Proceeds received from Asset
Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph
shall constitute "Excess Proceeds." When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds
exceeds $25 million, the Company shall make an Asset Sale Offer to all Holders
and all holders of other Indebtedness that is of equal priority with the Notes
containing provisions requiring offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds
of sales of assets to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such
other Indebtedness of equal priority that may be purchased out of the Excess
Proceeds, irrespective of the $25 million threshold. The offer price in any
Asset Sale Offer shall be payable in cash and equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the subject Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
date of purchase. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and such other
Indebtedness of equal priority tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the
amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and such other
Indebtedness of equal priority to be purchased on a pro rata basis.

                           If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of
an Asset Sale Offer, then the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary thereof may
use such remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by
this Indenture. Upon completion of any Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess
Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

                           In the event that the Company shall be required to
commence an offer to Holders to purchase Notes pursuant to this Section 4.11, it
shall follow the procedures specified in Sections 3.01 through 3.09.

                  Section 4.12. Sale and Leaseback Transactions.

                           The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries to, enter into any sale and leaseback transaction;
provided, however, that the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may enter
into a sale and leaseback transaction if:

                  (1)      the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary could have

                           (a)      incurred Indebtedness in an amount equal to
                  the Attributable Debt relating to such sale and leaseback
                  transaction under the Leverage Ratio test in the first
                  paragraph of Section 4.10; and

                           (b)      incurred a Lien to secure such Indebtedness
                  pursuant to Section 4.14 or the definition of "Permitted
                  Liens"; and

                  (2)      the transfer of assets in that sale and leaseback
         transaction is permitted by, and the Company or such Restricted
         Subsidiary applies the proceeds of such transaction in compliance with,
         Section 4.11.

                  Section 4.13. Transactions with Affiliates.

                           The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or
otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any
property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction,
contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the
benefit of, any Affiliate (each, an "Affiliate Transaction"), unless:

                                      -60-
<PAGE>

                  (1)      such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no
         less favorable to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary
         than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by
         the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person; and

                  (2)      the Company delivers to the Trustee:

                           (a)      with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or
                  series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate
                  consideration given or received by the Company or any such
                  Restricted Subsidiary in excess of $15 million, a resolution
                  of the Board of Directors of the Company or CCI in its
                  capacity as manager of the Company (other than with respect to
                  an Affiliate Transaction involving CCI) set forth in an
                  Officers' Certificate certifying that such Affiliate
                  Transaction complies with this Section 4.13 and that such
                  Affiliate Transaction has been approved by a majority of the
                  members of such Board of Directors; and

                           (b)      with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or
                  series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate
                  consideration given or received by the Company or any
                  Restricted Subsidiary in excess of $50 million, an opinion as
                  to the fairness to the Holders of such Affiliate Transaction
                  from a financial point of view issued by an accounting,
                  appraisal or investment banking firm of national standing.

                           The following items shall not be deemed to be
Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, shall not be subject to the provisions of
the prior paragraph:

                  (1)      any existing employment agreement entered into by the
         Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any employment agreement entered
         into by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in the
         ordinary course of business and consistent with the past practice of
         the Company or any Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary;

                  (2)      transactions between or among the Company and/or its
         Restricted Subsidiaries;

                  (3)      payment of reasonable directors' fees to Persons who
         are not otherwise Affiliates of the Company and customary
         indemnification and insurance arrangements in favor of directors,
         regardless of affiliation with the Company or any of its Restricted
         Subsidiaries;

                  (4)      payment of Management Fees;

                  (5)      Restricted Payments that are permitted by Section
         4.07 and Restricted Investments that are permitted by Section 4.08;

                  (6)      Permitted Investments; and

                  (7)      transactions pursuant to agreements existing on the
         Issue Date, as in effect on the Issue Date, or as subsequently
         modified, supplemented, or amended, to the extent that any such
         modifications, supplements or amendments complied with the applicable
         provisions of the first paragraph of this Section 4.13.

                  Section 4.14. Liens.

                           The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or incur any Lien
of any kind securing Indebtedness, Attributable Debt or

                                      -61-
<PAGE>

trade payables on any of their respective assets, whether owned on the Issue
Date or thereafter acquired, if such Lien is to secure such an obligation on a
basis contractually senior, in any respect, to the Liens securing the Notes and
if after giving effect thereto, or after giving effect to the incurrence of such
Indebtedness (including Pari Passu First Priority Indebtedness), Attributable
Debt or trade payables, the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio would exceed 3.75 to
1.0. The foregoing restriction shall not apply to Permitted Liens.

                  Section 4.15. Existence.

                           Subject to Article 5, the Company shall do or cause
to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect
(i) its limited liability company existence, and the corporate, partnership or
other existence of each of its Subsidiaries, in accordance with the respective
organizational documents (as the same may be amended from time to time) of the
Company or any such Subsidiary and (ii) the rights (charter and statutory),
licenses and franchises of the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right, license or
franchise, or the corporate, partnership or other existence of any of its
Subsidiaries (other than Capital Corp), if the Board of Directors of the Company
shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the
conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
and that the loss thereof is not adverse in any material respect to the Holders.

                  Section 4.16. Repurchase at the Option of Holders upon a
Change of Control.

                           If a Change of Control occurs, each Holder shall have
the right to require the Issuers to repurchase all or any part (equal to $1,000
or an integral multiple thereof) of that Holder's Notes pursuant to a "Change of
Control Offer." In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuers shall offer a
"Change of Control Payment" in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to
the date of purchase.

                           Within ten days following any Change of Control, the
Issuers shall mail a notice to each Holder (with a copy to the Trustee)
describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control
and stating:

                  (1)      the purchase price and the purchase date, which shall
         not exceed 30 Business Days from the date such notice is mailed (the
         "Change of Control Payment Date");

                  (2)      that any Note not tendered shall continue to accrue
         interest;

                  (3)      that, unless the Issuers default in the payment of
         the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant
         to the Change of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the
         Change of Control Payment Date;

                  (4)      that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased
         pursuant to a Change of Control Offer shall be required to surrender
         the Notes, with the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase"
         on the reverse of the Notes completed, to the Paying Agent at the
         address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the
         third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

                  (5)      that Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their
         election if the Paying Agent receives, not later than the close of
         business on the second Business Day preceding the Change of Control
         Payment Date, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter
         setting forth the name of

                                      -62-
<PAGE>

         the Holder, the principal amount of Notes delivered for purchase, and a
         statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election to have the
         Notes purchased; and

                  (6)      that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in
         part shall be issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the
         unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion
         must be equal to $1,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple
         thereof.

                           The Issuers shall comply with the requirements of
Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act (or any successor rules) and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and
regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Section
4.16, the Issuers' compliance with such laws and regulations shall not in and of
itself cause a breach of their obligations under this Section 4.16.

                           On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers
shall, to the extent lawful:

                  (1)      accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof
         properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

                  (2)      deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the
         Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof
         so tendered; and

                  (3)      deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the
         Notes so accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the
         aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions thereof being purchased
         by the Issuers.

                           The Paying Agent shall promptly mail to each Holder
so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee shall
promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to
each Holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of
the Notes surrendered, if any; provided, however, that each such new Note shall
be in a principal amount of $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. The Issuers
shall publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon
as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

                           The provisions described above that require the
Issuers to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control shall be
applicable regardless of whether or not any other provisions in this Indenture
are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control,
this Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require
that the Issuers repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover,
recapitalization or similar transaction.

                           Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
4.16, the Issuers shall not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a
Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the
manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth
in this Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers
and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of
Control Offer.

Section 4.17.     Note Guarantees; Security.

                           The Company shall, and shall cause (x) CCOH and (y)
each Subsidiary of the Company that, directly or indirectly, Guarantees or
pledges any assets to secure the payment of, or otherwise becomes an obligor
with respect to, any Indebtedness under clause (1) of the second paragraph of
Section 4.10 or Related Obligations to:

                                      -63-
<PAGE>

                  (1)      to the extent that such Subsidiary Guarantees or
         becomes an obligor with respect to such Indebtedness, execute and
         deliver a supplemental indenture substantially in the form of Exhibit G
         hereto providing for the guarantee of the payment of the Notes by CCOH
         or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to a Note Guarantee;

                  (2)      to the extent such Indebtedness is secured by a
         security interest in any assets of CCOH , the Company or such
         Subsidiary, execute one or more Security Documents upon substantially
         the same terms that grants any collateral agent, for the benefit of the
         Trustee and the Holders, a perfected second-priority security interest
         in the assets of CCOH or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, that
         secure Indebtedness under clause (1) of the second paragraph of Section
         4.10 or Related Obligations; and

                  (3)      execute and deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of
         Counsel (which may contain customary exceptions) that such supplemental
         indenture and/or Security Documents have been duly authorized, executed
         and delivered by CCOH, the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may
         be, and constitute the legal, valid, binding and enforceable
         obligations of CCOH or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

provided, however, that no such Note Guarantee or security need be provided if
the time such Note Guarantee and security would otherwise be granted (including
on the Issue Date) is not during a Guarantee and Pledge Availability Period, but
such Note Guarantee and security will be required to be provided in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 4.17 on or prior to the fifth Business Day
after the commencement of the next succeeding Guarantee and Pledge Availability
Period. If, following the release of any Note Guarantee or any Collateral in
accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, such Guarantor again
guarantees, pledges any assets to secure the payment of, or otherwise becomes an
obligor with respect to, the CCO Credit Facility, any other Indebtedness under
clause (1) of the second paragraph of Section 4.10 or Related Obligations then
such Guarantor shall also guarantee the Notes and/or grant the security
interest, to the extent described in, and subject to the provisions of, this
Section 4.17.

                           In the event that additional Liens are granted by CCO
or its Subsidiaries to secure obligations under the CCO Credit Facility, any
other Indebtedness under clause (1) of the second paragraph of Section 4.10 or
Related Obligations, second-priority Liens on the same assets will be granted to
secure the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, no such
second-priority Liens need be provided if the time such Lien would otherwise be
granted is not during a Guarantee and Pledge Availability Period, but such
second-priority Lien shall be required to be provided in accordance with the
foregoing sentence on or prior to the fifth Business Day of the commencement of
the next succeeding Guarantee and Pledge Availability Period.

                           Any Restricted Subsidiary acquired after the Issue
Date that is prohibited from issuing a Note Guarantee pursuant to the
restrictions contained in any debt instrument or other agreement in existence at
the time such Restricted Subsidiary was acquired and not entered into in
anticipation or contemplation of such acquisition shall not be required to
become a Guarantor so long as any such restriction is in existence and to the
extent of such restriction.

                           The Company shall take, and cause each of its
Subsidiaries to take, all action to preserve and protect the security interests
and Liens required to be granted by this Section 4.17 to the extent it (or its
Subsidiaries) takes such action to preserve or protect similar Liens securing
Indebtedness under clause (1) of the second paragraph of Section 4.10 or Related
Obligations.

                           For purposes of this Section 4.17 and Section 11.04
(but without prejudice to the Issuers' right to reclassify among categories of
Indebtedness under Section 4.10), Indebtedness that could

                                      -64-
<PAGE>

be characterized as outstanding under clause (1) of the second paragraph of
Section 4.10 shall be deemed to be Indebtedness under such clause (1).

                  Section 4.18. Payments for Consent.

                           The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or cause to be paid any
consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder for or as an inducement to any
consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of this Indenture
or the Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all
Holders that consent, waive or agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the

                  Section 4.19. Suspension of Covenants.

                           During any period of time that (a) the applicable
series of Notes has an Investment Grade Rating from both Rating Agencies and (b)
no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under this
Indenture (the "Suspension Period"), the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
shall not, as to such series of Notes, be subject to the provisions of Sections
4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12 and 4.13 and clause (D) of the first
paragraph of Section 5.01 (collectively, the "Suspended Covenants"). The Issuers
shall promptly notify the Trustee of the commencement of a Suspension Period.

                           If the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are
not subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to a series of Notes for any
period of time as a result of the previous sentence and, subsequently, (i) one,
or both, of the Rating Agencies withdraw their ratings or downgrade the ratings
assigned to such series of Notes below the required Investment Grade Ratings or
(ii) a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing under such Notes
(each, a "Reversion Date"), then the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
shall thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants with respect to
such series of Notes.

                           For purposes of calculating the amount available to
be made as Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the first paragraph of
Section 4.07, calculations under that clause will be made with reference to the
Reference Date, as set forth in that clause. Accordingly, (x) Restricted
Payments made during the Suspension Period not otherwise permitted pursuant to
any of clauses (1) through (7) of the second paragraph of Section 4.07 will
reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under clause (iii)
of the second paragraph of Section 4.07; provided, however, that the amount
available to be made as Restricted Payments on the Reversion Date shall not be
reduced below zero solely as a result of such Restricted Payments, but may be
reduced below zero as a result of Consolidated EBITDA for the purpose of clause
(iii)(a) of the second paragraph of Section 4.07 being negative, and (y) the
items specified in subclauses (a) through (c) of clause (iii) of the second
paragraph of Section 4.07 that occur during the Suspension Period will increase
the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under clause (iii) of the
second paragraph of Section 4.07. Any Unrestricted Subsidiary that was
designated as such during any Suspension Period that is a Subsidiary of the
Company on the Reversion Date shall be deemed to be a Restricted Subsidiary on
the corresponding Reversion Date and such designation shall not be deemed a
Default or Event of Default under this Indenture.

                           For purposes of Sections 3.09 and 4.11, on the
Reversion Date, the unutilized Excess Proceeds will be reset to zero.

registration and other rights set forth in the registration rights agreement,
the form of which is attached as Exhibit H hereto, in accordance with the terms
thereof, but only if and when none of the Collateral consists of, or by the
terms of this Indenture in the future could consist of, securities (as defined
in Section 3-16 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act) that would require
the inclusion of financial statements in any registration statement required
under such registration rights agreement of a person other than the Issuers.

                  stated maturity the principal amount of such Indebtedness

                  all of the property of the Company or any of its Significant

         Indenture and such Note Guarantee); and

                  (10)     so long as the Security Documents securing any series
         of Notes have not otherwise been terminated in accordance with their
         terms or the Collateral as a whole has not otherwise been released from
         the Lien of the Security Documents securing any series of Notes in
         accordance with the terms thereof, (a) any default by the Company or
         any Subsidiary in the performance of its obligations under the Security
         Documents securing any series of Notes (after the lapse of any
         applicable grace periods) or this Indenture which adversely affects the
         enforceability, validity, perfection or priority of the Trustee's Lien
         on the Collateral or which adversely affects the condition or value of
         the Collateral, taken as a whole, in any material respect, (b)
         repudiation or disaffirmation by the Company or any Subsidiary of its
         respective obligations under the Security Documents securing any series
         of Notes and (c) the determination in a judicial proceeding that the
         Security Documents securing any series of Notes are unenforceable or
         invalid against the Company or any Subsidiary for any reason.

                  Section 6.02. Acceleration.

                           In the case of an Event of Default arising from
clause (7) or (8) of Section 6.01 with respect to the Company, all of the
outstanding Notes shall become due and payable immediately without further
action or notice. In the case of an Event of Default described in the foregoing
clauses (1) and (2) as to a particular series of Notes, the Trustee or the
Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes
then outstanding may declare such series of Notes due and payable immediately.
If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to
the Issuers or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes by notice to the Issuers and the Trustee may declare the Notes to be due
and payable immediately. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the Notes then outstanding by written notice to the Trustee may on behalf of
all of the Holders rescind an acceleration and its consequences (except
nonpayment of principal, interest or premium that has become due solely because
of the acceleration) if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or
decree and if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived.

                  Section 6.03. Other Remedies.

                           If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the
Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of principal,
premium, if any, and interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any
provision of the Notes or this Indenture.

                           The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does
not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding.
A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or
remedy accruing upon a Default or an Event of Default shall not impair the right
or remedy or constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in a Default or the Event of
Default. All remedies are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.

                  Section 6.04. Waiver of Existing Defaults.

                           Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the
Holders of all of the Notes waive an existing Default or Event of Default with
respect to the Notes and its consequences hereunder, except a continuing Default
or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or
interest on, the Notes (including in connection with an offer to purchase);
provided, however, that the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of a then outstanding series of Notes may rescind an acceleration and its
consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from such
acceleration. Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any
Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every
purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

                  Section 6.05. Control by Majority.

                           Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the Notes then outstanding may direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or
exercising any trust or power conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse
to follow any direction that conflicts with law or this Indenture that the
Trustee determines may be prejudicial to the rights of other Holders or that may
involve the Trustee in personal liability. The Trustee may take any other action
which it deems proper that is not inconsistent with any such directive.

                  Section 6.06. Limitation on Suits.

                           A Holder may pursue a remedy with respect to this
Indenture or the Notes only if:

                  (a)      the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a
         continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes;

                  (b)      the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of
         the Notes then outstanding make a written request to the Trustee to
         pursue the remedy;

                  (c)      such Holder or Holders offer and, if requested,
         provide to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against
         any loss, liability or expense;

                  (d)      the Trustee does not comply with the request within
         60 days after receipt of the request and the offer and, if requested,
         the provision of indemnity; and

                  (e)      during such 60-day period the Holders of a majority
         in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding do not give
         the Trustee a direction inconsistent with the request.

                           A Holder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the
rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over another
Holder.

                  Section 6.07. Rights of Holders to Receive Payment.

                           Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal, premium, if
any, and interest on the Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in
the Note (including in connection with an offer to purchase), or to bring suit
for the

                                      -70-
<PAGE>

enforcement of any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be
impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.

                  Section 6.08. Collection Suit by Trustee.

                           If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(1)
or (2) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment
in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Issuers for the
whole amount of principal of, premium, if any, and interest remaining unpaid on
the applicable series of Notes and interest on overdue principal and, to the
extent lawful, interest and such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover
the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

                  Section 6.09. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.

                           The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of
claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to
have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents
and counsel) and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the
Issuers (or any other obligor upon the Notes), their creditors or their property
and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and distribute any money
or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and any custodian in
any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such
payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the
making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any
amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Trustee under Section 7.07. To the extent that the payment of any such
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents
and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 out of the
estate in any such proceeding, shall be denied for any reason, payment of the
same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid out of, any and all
distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the
Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding whether in liquidation or
under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise. Nothing herein
contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or
accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder, or to
authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such
proceeding.

                  Section 6.10. Priorities.

                           If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this
Article, it shall pay out the money in the following order:

suit by a Holder pursuant to Section 6.07, or a suit by Holders of more than 10%
in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.

                                     TRUSTEE

                  Section 7.01. Duties of Trustee.

                  (1)      If an Event of Default has occurred and is
         continuing, the Trustee shall, subject to the terms and conditions of
         this Indenture, exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by
         this Indenture and the Security Documents and use the same degree of
         care and skill in its exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or
         use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own
         affairs.

                  (2)      Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:

                           (a)      the duties of the Trustee shall be
                  determined solely by the express provisions of the agreements
                  referred to in clause (1) and the Trustee need perform only
                  those duties that are specifically set forth in such
                  agreements and no others, and no implied covenants or
                  obligations shall be read into such agreements against the
                  Trustee; and

                           (b)      in the absence of bad faith on its part, the
                  Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the
                  statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed
                  therein, upon certificates or opinions required to be
                  furnished to the Trustee hereunder and conforming to the
                  requirements of such agreements. However, the Trustee shall
                  examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or
                  not they conform to the requirements of such agreements (but
                  need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of any
                  mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).

                  (3)      The Trustee may not be relieved from liabilities for
         its own gross negligent action, its own gross negligent failure to act,
         or its own willful misconduct, except that:

                           (a)      This paragraph does not limit the effect of
                  paragraph (2) of this Section 7.01.

                           (b)      The Trustee shall not be liable for any
                  error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer,
                  unless it is proved that the Trustee was grossly negligent in
                  ascertaining the pertinent facts.

                           (c)      The Trustee shall not be liable with respect
                  to any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in
                  accordance with a direction received by it pursuant to Section
                  6.05.

                           (d)      Whether or not therein expressly so
                  provided, every provision of the agreements referred to in
                  clause (1) that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject
                  to paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this Section 7.01.

                                      -72-
<PAGE>

                           (e)      No provision of any such agreements shall
                  require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or incur
                  any liability. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to
                  exercise any of its rights and powers under this Indenture or
                  the Security Documents at the request of any Holder, unless
                  such Holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and
                  indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability,
                  claim, damage or expense.

                           (f)      The Trustee shall not be liable for interest
                  on any money received by it except as the Trustee may agree in
                  writing with the Issuers. Money held in trust by the Trustee
                  need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent
                  required by law.

                           (g)      The Trustee shall not be bound to make any
                  investigation into the facts or matters stated in any
                  resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
                  report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond,
                  debenture or other paper or documents.

                  Section 7.02. Rights of Trustee.

                  (1)      The Trustee may conclusively rely upon any document
         (whether in its original or facsimile form) believed by it to be
         genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper Person. The
         Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the document.

                  (2)      Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it
         may require an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel or both.
         The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to
         take in good faith in reliance on such Officers' Certificate or Opinion
         of Counsel. The Trustee may consult with counsel of its own selection
         and the written advice or opinion of such counsel or any Opinion of
         Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection from
         liability in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it
         hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon.

                  (3)      The Trustee may act through its attorneys and agents
         and shall not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any
         agent appointed with due care.

                  (4)      The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it
         takes or omits to take in good faith that it believes to be authorized
         or within the rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture or
         the Security Documents.

                  (5)      Unless otherwise specifically provided in this
         Indenture or the Security Documents, any demand, request, direction or
         notice from either of the Issuers shall be sufficient if signed by an
         Officer of such Issuer.

                  (6)      The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise
         any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture or the
         Security Documents at the request or direction of any of the Holders
         unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable
         security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses
         and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such
         request or direction.

                  (7)      The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of
         any Default or Event of Default unless either (a) a Responsible Officer
         of the Trustee shall have actual knowledge of such Default or Event of
         Default or (b) written notice of such Default or Event of Default shall
         have been given to and received by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee
         by the Issuers or any Holder.

                  Section 7.03. Individual Rights of Trustee.

                           The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity
may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and may otherwise deal with the Issuers
or any Affiliate of the Issuers with the same rights it would have if it were
not Trustee. However, in the event that the Trustee acquires any conflicting
interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for
permission to continue as trustee or resign. Any Agent may do the same with like
rights and duties. The Trustee is also subject to Sections 7.10 and 7.11.

                  Section 7.04. Trustee's Disclaimer.

                           The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no
representation as to the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Notes, it
shall not be accountable for the Issuers' use of the proceeds from the Notes or
any money paid to the Issuers or upon the Issuers' direction under any provision
of this Indenture, it shall not be responsible for the use or application of any
money received by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee, and it shall not be
responsible for any statement or recital herein or any statement in the Notes or
any other document in connection with the sale of the Notes or pursuant to this
Indenture other than its certificate of authentication.

                  Section 7.05. Notice of Defaults.

                           If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is
continuing and if it is known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the
Trustee shall mail to Holders a notice of the Default or Event of Default within
90 days after the Trustee acquires knowledge thereof. Except in the case of a
Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or
interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a
committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding
the notice is in the interests of the Holders.

                  Section 7.06. Reports by Trustee to Holders.

                           By May 15th of each year, and for so long as Notes
remain outstanding, the Trustee shall mail to the Holders a brief report dated
as of such reporting date that complies with TIA Section 313(a) (but if no event
described in TIA Section 313(a) has occurred within the twelve months preceding
the reporting date, no report need be transmitted). The Trustee also shall
comply with TIA Section 313(b)(2). The Trustee shall also transmit by mail all
reports as required by TIA Section 313(c).

                           A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to
the Holders shall be mailed to the Company and filed with the SEC and each stock
exchange on which the Notes are listed in accordance with TIA Section 313(d).
The Issuers shall promptly notify the Trustee when the Notes are listed on any
stock exchange.

                  Section 7.07. Compensation and Indemnity.

                           The Issuers shall pay to the Trustee from time to
time reasonable compensation for its acceptance of this Indenture, the Security
Documents, any Registration Rights Agreement and any other document delivered in
connection with any of such agreements and its services under any of such
agreements or other documents. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited
by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Issuers shall
reimburse the Trustee promptly upon request for all reasonable disbursements,
advances and expenses incurred or made by it in addition to the compensation for
its services. Such expenses shall include the reasonable compensation,
disbursements and expenses of the Trustee's agents and counsel.

                                      -74-
<PAGE>

                           The Issuers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify
the Trustee against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the Trustee arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties
under (or in connection with) this Indenture, including the costs and expenses
of enforcing this Indenture, the Security Documents, any Registration Rights
Agreement and any other document delivered in connection therewith (including
this Section 7.07) and defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by
the Issuers or any Holder or any other Person) or liability in connection with
the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder, except to
the extent any such loss, liability or expense may be attributable to its gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Trustee shall notify the Issuers promptly
of any claim for which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so
notify the Issuers shall not relieve the Issuers of their obligations hereunder.
The Issuers shall defend the claim and the Trustee shall cooperate in the
defense. The Trustee may have separate counsel and the Issuers shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel. The Issuers need not pay for any
settlement made without their consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

                           The obligations of the Issuers this Section 7.07
shall survive resignation or removal of the Trustee and the satisfaction and
discharge of this Indenture.

                           To secure the Issuers' payment obligations in this
Section, the Trustee shall have a Lien prior to the Notes on all money or
property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay
principal and interest on particular Notes. Such Lien shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Trustee and the satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture.

                           When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services
after an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(7) or (8) occurs, the
expenses and the compensation for the services (including the fees and expenses
of its agents and counsel) are intended to constitute expenses of administration
under any Bankruptcy Law.

                           The Trustee shall comply with the provisions of TIA
Section 313(b)(2) to the extent applicable.

                  Section 7.08. Replacement of Trustee.

                           A resignation or removal of the Trustee and
appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only upon the
successor Trustee's acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section.

                           The Trustee may resign in writing at any time and be
discharged from the trust hereby created by so notifying the Issuers. The
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may
remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and the Issuers in writing. The
Issuers may remove the Trustee if:

                  (a)      the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;

                  (b)      the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or
         an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any
         Bankruptcy Law;

                  (c)      a custodian or public officer takes charge of the
         Trustee or its property; or

                  (d)      the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.

<PAGE>

                           If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy
exists in the office of Trustee for any reason, the Issuers shall promptly
appoint a successor Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes
office, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes may appoint a successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed
by the Issuers.

                           If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60
days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the
Issuers, or the Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes may petition at the expense of the Issuers any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

                           If the Trustee, after written request by any Holder
who has been a Holder for at least six months, fails to comply with Section
7.10, such Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

                           A successor Trustee shall deliver a written
acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Issuers.
Thereupon, the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become
effective, and the successor Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and
duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a
notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly
transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee; provided
all sums owing to the Trustee hereunder have been paid and subject to the Lien
provided for in Section 7.07. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee
pursuant to this Section 7.08, the Issuers' obligations under Section 7.07 shall
continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.

                  Section 7.09. Successor Trustee by Merger, etc.

                           If the Trustee consolidates, merges or converts into,
or transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to,
another corporation, the successor corporation without any further act shall be
the successor Trustee.

                  Section 7.10. Eligibility; Disqualification.

                           There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder that
is a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United
States of America or of any state thereof that is authorized under such laws to
exercise corporate trustee power, that is subject to supervision or examination
by federal or state authorities and that has a combined capital and surplus of
at least $100 million as set forth in its most recent published annual report of
condition.

                           This Indenture shall always have a Trustee who
satisfies the requirements of TIA Sections 310(a)(1), (2) and (5). The Trustee
is subject to TIA Section 310(b).

                  Section 7.11. Preferential Collection of Claims Against the
Issuers.

                           The Trustee is subject to TIA Section 311(a),
excluding any creditor relationship listed in TIA Section 311(b). A Trustee who
has resigned or been removed shall be subject to TIA Section 311(a) to the
extent indicated therein.

                  Section 7.12. Authorization of the Trustee.

         Each present and future Holder hereby (a) authorizes the Trustee, on
such Holder's behalf, to execute and deliver the intercreditor agreement as
referred to in the Issuers' April 20, 2004 Offering Memorandum regarding the
Notes, and (b) agrees that, subject to the penultimate sentence of this Section

                                      -76-
<PAGE>

7.12, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary in this Indenture, (i)
the Trustee shall be authorized to take (or refrain from taking) any and all
actions required, authorized or contemplated by such intercreditor agreement and
(ii) the rights, agreements, obligations, covenants and duties of the Trustee to
or otherwise on behalf of the Holders under this Indenture and the Security
Documents shall be subject to the rights, agreements, obligations, covenants and
duties of the Trustee under such intercreditor agreement to or otherwise on
behalf of the Pari Passu First Priority Secured Parties. The Trustee agrees with
the Holders that the Trustee will not enter into any amendment or supplement to
the above-referenced intercreditor agreement (except to provide for the
inclusion therein of Additional Pari Passu First Priority Indebtedness or
Additional Pari Passu Second Priority Indebtedness) without in each case
obtaining the prior consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (but without the necessity of any
consent from, or notice to, the Company or any of its Affiliates). Each present
and future Holder in such capacity also acknowledges and agrees that, although
the Issuers and their Affiliates may not be parties thereto or bound thereby,
such Holder will nonetheless be bound by the above-referenced intercreditor
agreement and such intercreditor agreement will be directly enforceable against
such Holder in its capacity as such. None of the Issuers or any of their
Affiliates will be a party to, bound by, or a beneficiary of, any of the
provisions of such intercreditor agreement, nor will the parties to such
intercreditor agreement have any contractual right of enforcement thereunder
against the Issuers or any Guarantor. In addition, the Trustee may enter into
other agreements on behalf of Holders to the extent that such agreements would
be permitted as amendments or supplements under Article 9 of this Indenture.

boards of directors or the Board of Directors of CCI evidenced by a resolution
set forth in an Officers' Certificate of each of the Issuers, at any time, elect

deemed to have been discharged from their obligations with respect to any series
of outstanding Notes and the Note Guarantees with respect thereto on the date

For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Issuers and the Guarantors
shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented

which shall thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of
Section 8.05 and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in (a) and (b)
below, and to have satisfied all their other obligations under such series of
Notes, such Note Guarantees with respect thereto and this Indenture (and the

instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following provisions which
shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder:

         mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an
         office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in
         trust;

                  (c)      the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of
         the Trustee and the Issuers' obligations in connection therewith; and

                  (d)      the Legal Defeasance provisions of this Indenture;

                           Subject to compliance with this Article 8, the
Issuers may exercise their option under this Section 8.02 notwithstanding the
prior exercise of their option under Section 8.03.

         Section 8.03. Covenant Defeasance.

                           Upon the Issuers' exercise under Section 8.01 of the
option applicable to this Section 8.03, the Issuers and the Guarantors shall,
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04, be
released from their obligations under the covenants contained in Article 5 and
Sections 4.03, 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.16, 4.17, 4.19,
4.20, 10.01 and 10.02 with respect to such series of Notes on and after the date
the conditions set forth in Section 8.04 are satisfied (hereinafter, "Covenant
Defeasance"), and such series of Notes shall thereafter be deemed not
"outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration
or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such
covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "outstanding" for all other purposes
hereunder (it being understood that such series of Notes shall not be deemed
outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, Covenant Defeasance
means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes, the Issuers may omit to
comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or
limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by
reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or by reason of
any reference in any such covenant to any other provision herein or in any other
document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a Default or an Event
of Default under Section 6.01, but, except as specified above, the remainder of
this Indenture and such Notes shall be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the
Issuers' exercise under Section 8.01 of the option applicable to this Section
8.03, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.04,
Sections 6.01(3) through 6.01(6) shall not constitute Events of Default.

         Section 8.04. Conditions to Legal or Covenant Defeasance.

                           The following shall be the conditions to the
application of either Section 8.02 or 8.03 to the outstanding Notes:

                           In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or
Covenant Defeasance with respect to a series of Notes:

                  (1)      the Issuers must irrevocably deposit with the
         Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of such series of
         Notes, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government Securities or a
         combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the
         opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public
         accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on
         the outstanding Notes of such series on the stated maturity or on the
         applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuers must
         specify whether such series of Notes is being defeased to maturity or
         to a particular redemption date;

                  (2)      in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuers shall
         have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably
         acceptable to the Trustee confirming that

                                      -78-
<PAGE>

                           (a)      the Issuers have received from, or there has
                  been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or

                           (b)      since the Issue Date, there has been a
                  change in the applicable federal income tax law,

          in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of
          Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of such series of outstanding
          Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax
          purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to
          federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the
          same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had
          not occurred;

                  (3)      in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Issuers shall
         have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably
         acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the Holders of such series of
         outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal
         income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be
         subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner
         and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant
         Defeasance had not occurred;

                  (4)      no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
         and be continuing either:

                           (a)      on the date of such deposit (other than a
                  Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of
                  funds to be applied to such deposit); or

                           (b)      insofar as Events of Default from bankruptcy
                  or insolvency events are concerned, at any time in the period
                  ending on the 91st day after the date of deposit;

                  (5)      such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not
         result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any
         material agreement or instrument (other than this Indenture) to which
         the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party or by
         which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is bound;

                  (6)      the Issuers must have delivered to the Trustee an
         Opinion of Counsel to the effect that after the 91st day, assuming no
         intervening bankruptcy, that no Holder is an insider of either of the
         Issuers following the deposit and that such deposit would not be deemed
         by a court of competent jurisdiction a transfer for the benefit of
         either Issuer in its capacity as such, the trust funds will not be
         subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
         reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally;

                  (7)      the Issuers must deliver to the Trustee an Officers'
         Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuers with
         the intent of preferring the Holders of the Notes of such series over
         the other creditors of the Issuers with the intent of defeating,
         hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Issuers or others;
         and

                  (8)      the Issuers must deliver to the Trustee an Officers'
         Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
         precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance
         have been complied with.

                           Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Opinion of Counsel
required by clause (2) above with respect to a Legal Defeasance need not be
delivered if all applicable Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation

                                      -79-

                  (a)      have become due and payable; or

                  (b)      will become due and payable on the maturity date
         within one year, under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the
         giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the
         expense, of the Issuers.

                  Section 8.05. Deposited Money and Government Securities to Be
                                Held in Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions.

                           Subject to Section 8.06, all money and non-callable
Government Securities (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the
Trustee (or other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section
8.05, the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 8.04 in respect of the outstanding
Notes of a particular series shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee,
in accordance with the provisions of such Notes and this Indenture, to the
payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Issuers
acting as Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such
Notes of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal,
premium, if any, and interest, but such money need not be segregated from other
funds except to the extent required by law.

                           The Issuers shall pay and indemnify the Trustee
against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the cash or
non-callable Government Securities deposited pursuant to Section 8.04 or the
principal and interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee
or other charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the
outstanding Notes.

                           Anything in this Article 8 to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Issuers from time to
time upon the request of the Issuers any money or non-callable Government
Securities held by it as provided in Section 8.04 which, in the opinion of a
nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a
written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion
delivered under Section 8.04(1)), are in excess of the amount thereof that would
then be required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or
Covenant Defeasance.

                  Section 8.06. Repayment to Issuers.

                           Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying
Agent, or then held by the Issuers, in trust for the payment of the principal
of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two
years after such principal, and premium, if any, or interest has become due and
payable shall be paid to the Issuers on their request or (if then held by the
Issuers) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note shall
thereafter look only to the Issuers for payment thereof, and all liability of
the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all
liability of the Issuers as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided,
however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make
any such repayment, may at the expense of the Issuers cause to be published
once, in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal (national edition),
notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified
therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of such notification
or publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining shall be
repaid to the Issuers.

                  Section 8.07. Reinstatement.

                           If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any
United States dollars or non-callable Government Securities in accordance with
Section 8.02 or 8.03, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of
any court or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise

                                      -80-
<PAGE>

prohibiting such application, then the Issuers' obligations under this Indenture
and the Notes, shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred
pursuant to Section 8.02 or 8.03 until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent
is permitted to apply all such money in accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03, as
the case may be; provided, however, that, if the Issuers make any payment of
principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any Note following the
reinstatement of their obligations, the Issuers shall be subrogated to the
rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the money held
by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

                                   ARTICLE 9

                        AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER

                  Section 9.01. Without Consent of Holders.

                           Notwithstanding Section 9.02, the Issuers, the
Guarantors and the Trustee, together, may amend or supplement this Indenture,
the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the Security Documents without the consent of
any Holder:

                  (1)      to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

                  (2)      to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or
         in place of certificated Notes;

                  (3)      to provide for or confirm the issuance of Additional
         Notes;

                  (4)      to provide for the assumption of either Issuer's
         obligations to Holders in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale
         of all or substantially all of the assets of such Issuer pursuant to
         Article 5;

                  (5)      to make any change that would provide any additional
         rights or benefits to the Holders or that does not adversely affect the
         legal rights under this Indenture of any Holder;

                  (6)      to, if applicable, comply with requirements of the
         SEC in order to, if applicable, effect or maintain the qualification of
         this Indenture under the TIA or otherwise as necessary to comply with
         applicable law;

                  (7)      to release Collateral or a Guarantor, as permitted
         under the terms of this Indenture or the Security Documents;

                  (8)      to add any additional assets as Collateral; or

                  (9)      to add a Guarantor.

                           Upon the request of the Issuers accompanied by a
resolution of their respective boards of directors or the Board of Directors of
CCI authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and
upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02, the
Trustee shall join with the Issuers in the execution of any amended or
supplemental Indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture
and to make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be
therein contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into such
amended or supplemental Indenture that affects its own rights, duties or
immunities under this Indenture, the Security Documents or otherwise.

                  Section 9.02. With Consent of Holders.

                           Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.02,
this Indenture (including Sections 4.11 and 4.16), the Notes, the Note
Guarantees or the Security Documents may be amended or supplemented with the
consent of the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or a tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes)
and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07, any existing Default or compliance with
any provision of this Indenture, the Notes (other than any provision relating to
the right of any Holder to bring suit for the enforcement of any payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Note, on or after the scheduled
due dates expressed in the Notes), the Note Guarantees or the Security Documents
may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding; provided, however, that if any
such amendment or waiver, by its terms, directly and disproportionately affects
one series of the Notes then outstanding, such amendment or waiver shall require
the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of such
series of Notes, and if any such amendment only affects one series of Notes, the
holders of the other series of Notes shall not be required to consent thereto
(including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase
of, or a tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). Section 2.08 shall
determine which Notes are considered to be "outstanding" for purposes of this
Section 9.02.

                           Upon the request of the Issuers accompanied by a
resolution of their respective boards of directors or the Board of Directors of
CCI authorizing the execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and
upon the filing with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the
consent of the Holders as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the
documents described in Section 7.02, the Trustee shall join with the Issuers in
the execution of such amended or supplemental Indenture unless such amended or
supplemental Indenture directly affects the Trustee's own rights, duties or
immunities under this Indenture, the Security Documents or otherwise, in which
case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter
into such amended or supplemental Indenture.

                           It shall not be necessary for the consent of the
Holders under this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the
substance thereof.

                           After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this
Section 9.02 becomes effective, the Issuers shall mail to the Holders affected
thereby a notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any
failure of the Issuers to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not,
however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or
supplemental Indenture or waiver. Subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07, the Holders
of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may
waive compliance in a particular instance by the Issuers with any provision of
this Indenture or the Notes. However, without the consent of each Holder
affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02 may not
(with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):

                  (1)      reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders
         must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

                  (2)      reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity,
         or ranking, of any Note or alter the scheduled payment provisions with
         respect to the redemption of the Notes, or payment of principal or
         interest (other than provisions relating to Sections 4.11 and 4.16);

                  (3)      reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of
         interest on any Note (including Special Interest, if any);

                                      -82-
<PAGE>

                  (4)      waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of
         principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes (except a
         rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a
         majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes and a waiver of the
         payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

                  (5)      make any Note payable in money other than that stated
         in the Notes;

                  (6)      make any change in the provisions of this Indenture
         relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders to
         receive payments of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on
         the Notes;

                  (7)      waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note
         (other than a payment required by Section 4.11 or 4.16);

                  (8)      make any change in this Section 9.02; or

                  (9)      release any Guarantor that is a Significant
         Subsidiary from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee
         otherwise than in accordance with the terms of this Indenture.

                           Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 9.02, in addition to the release of Collateral expressly permitted by
this Indenture and the Security Documents, all or any portion of the Collateral
may be released under this Indenture and the Security Documents as to the Notes
and any Guarantor may be released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee,
with the consent of the Holders of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding.

                  Section 9.03. Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.

                           Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or
the Notes shall be set forth in an amended or supplemental Indenture that
complies with the TIA as then in effect.

                  Section 9.04. Revocation and Effect of Consents.

                           Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes
effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a continuing consent by the Holder and
every subsequent Holder or portion of a Note that evidences the same debt as the
consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not made on any
Note. However, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to
its Note if the Trustee receives written notice of revocation before the date
the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes effective. An amendment, supplement
or waiver becomes effective in accordance with its terms and thereafter binds
every Holder.

                  Section 9.05. Notation on or Exchange of Notes.

                           The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about
an amendment, supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The
Issuers in exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall, upon receipt
of an Authentication Order, authenticate new Notes that reflect the amendment,
supplement or waiver.

                           Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a
new Note shall not affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement
or waiver.

                  Section 9.06. Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc.

                           The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental
Indenture authorized pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement
does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the
Trustee under this Indenture, the Security Documents or otherwise. The Issuers
may not sign an amendment or supplemental Indenture until their respective
Boards of Directors approve it. In executing any amended or supplemental
indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive and (subject to Section
7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, in addition to the documents
required by Section 12.04, an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
in each case from each of the Issuers, stating that the execution of such
amended or supplemental indenture is authorized or permitted by this Indenture.

                        COLLATERAL AND SECURITY DOCUMENTS

                  Section 10.01. Security Documents; Additional Collateral.

                           The Company and each Guarantor will execute and
comply with, and cause each of its Subsidiaries to execute and comply with, the
terms of each Security Document to which such Person is, or is required to be, a
party.

                  Section 10.02. Opinions.

                           The Company shall furnish to the Trustee on March 15
of each year, beginning March 15, 2005, an Opinion or Opinions of Counsel, dated
as of such date, either stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, such
action has been taken with respect to the recording, registering, filing,
re-recording, re-registering and re-filing of (x) this Indenture, the Security
Documents and all supplemental Indentures and amendments thereto, and (y)
financing statements, continuation statements or other instruments of further
assurances, as is necessary under applicable law to maintain the Lien created by
each such Security Document and reciting the details of such action or referring
to prior Opinions of Counsel in which such details are given, and stating that
all financing statements and continuation statements have been executed and
filed that are necessary to perfect such Lien, or stating that, in the opinion
of such counsel, no such action is necessary to maintain such Liens and such
other statements or certificates as may be required by the Security Documents.

                  Section 10.03. Suits to Protect the Collateral.

                           The Trustee shall have power to institute in its name
and to maintain such suits and proceedings as it may deem expedient to prevent
any impairment of the Collateral by any acts which may be unlawful or in
violation of this Indenture or any of the Security Documents, and such suits and
proceedings as necessary to preserve or protect its interests and the interests
of the Holders in the Collateral, including power to institute and maintain
suits or proceedings to restrain the enforcement of or compliance with any
legislative or other governmental enactment, rule or order that may be
unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, if the enforcement of, or compliance
with, such enactment, rule or order would impair the security hereunder or under
any of the Security Documents, or be prejudicial to the interests of the Holders
or the Trustee.

                  Section 10.04. Release of Collateral.

                  (a)      The Trustee shall not at any time release Collateral
from the Liens created by this Indenture and the Security Documents unless such
release is in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture and the Security
Documents.

                  (b)      In the event that (i) all of the Liens on any of the
Collateral securing the CCO Credit Facility and the Related Obligations or any
other Indebtedness under clause (1) of the second paragraph of Section 4.10 are
released for any reason, including, without limitation, in connection with the
repayment in full of all obligations under the CCO Credit Facility and the
Related Obligations or any other Indebtedness under clause (1) of the second
paragraph of Section 4.10, in each case, without the refinancing thereof on a
secured basis, and there is no Event of Default pursuant to clause (1) or (2) of
Section 6.01 hereof then existing (or that would result therefrom), or (ii) any
Collateral is released in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.02, the
Liens on such Collateral securing the Notes will be automatically released and
terminated. In addition, in the event of the Legal Defeasance or Covenant
Defeasance or discharge of a series of Notes, the Liens on all Collateral
securing such series of Notes (except for any Liens required by Article 8) will
be automatically released and terminated.

                  (c)      To evidence any such release and termination, the
Company shall be entitled to such releases, terminations and other documents and
instruments as the Company or any third party entitled to rely thereon may
request, and the Trustee shall, at the Company's expense, execute and deliver
such requested releases, terminations and other documents and instruments, with
respect to items of Collateral subject to release pursuant to clauses (a) and
(b) above (the "Released Collateral") upon compliance with the conditions
precedent that the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee the following:

                  (i)      a notice from the Company requesting release of
         Released Collateral (a "Company Notice") and specifically describing
         the proposed Released Collateral;

                  (ii)     an Officers' Certificate certifying that

                           (1)      the release of such Released Collateral
                  complies with the terms and conditions of this Indenture,

                           (2)      all conditions precedent in this Indenture
                  and the Security Documents to such release have been complied
                  with,

                           (3)      no Default or Event of Default pursuant to
                  clause (1) or (2) of Section 6.01 hereof is in effect or
                  continuing on the date thereof or would result therefrom
                  (including, without limitation, as a result of an Insolvency
                  Proceeding), and

                  (iii)    an Opinion of Counsel substantially to the effect
         that all conditions precedent herein and under any of the Security
         Documents relating to the release of such Collateral have been complied
         with.

                  (d)      The release of any Collateral from the Liens of the
Security Documents or the release, in whole or in part, of the Liens created by
the Security Documents shall not be deemed to impair the security under this
Indenture in contravention of the provisions hereof if and to the extent the
Collateral is released pursuant to this Indenture or the applicable Security
Documents.

                  Section 10.05. Sufficiency of Release.

                           All purchasers and grantees of any property or rights
purporting to be released shall be entitled to rely upon any release executed by
the Trustee hereunder as sufficient for the purpose of this Indenture and as
constituting a good and valid release of the property therein described from the
Lien of this Indenture and of the Security Documents.

                  Section 10.06. Actions by the Trustee.

                           Subject to the provisions of the Security Documents
and this Indenture, the Trustee may in its sole discretion and without the
consent of the Holders take all actions that are deemed necessary or appropriate
in order to (i) enforce any of the terms of the Security Documents and (ii) to
collect and receive all amounts payable in respect of the obligations of the
Company and any Guarantors under the Security Documents and this Indenture. The
Trustee shall have the power to institute and maintain such suits and
proceedings as it may deem expedient in order to prevent any impairment of the
Collateral by any act that may be unlawful or in violation of this Indenture or
the Security Documents, and such suits and proceedings as the Trustee may deem
expedient to preserve or protect its interests and those of the Holders in the
Collateral. No duty beyond that set forth in Section 7.01 is imposed on the
Trustee pursuant to this Section 10.06.

                                   ARTICLE 11

                                    GUARANTEE

                           The following provisions shall become applicable to
each Guarantor upon it initially becoming, or being required to become, a
Guarantor:

                  Section 11.01. Unconditional Guarantee.

                           Each Guarantor unconditionally guarantees, on a
senior basis jointly and severally, to each Holder authenticated and delivered
by the Trustee and to the Trustee and its successors and assigns, the Notes or
the obligations of the Company hereunder or thereunder, that: (i) the principal
of and interest on the Notes will be promptly paid in full when due, subject to
any applicable grace period, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise,
and interest on the overdue principal, if any, and interest on any interest, to
the extent lawful, of the Notes and all other obligations of the Company to the
Holders or the Trustee hereunder or thereunder will be promptly paid in full or
performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (ii) in case
of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Notes or of any such other
obligations, the same will be promptly paid in full when due or performed in
accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, subject to any applicable
grace period, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, subject,
however, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, to the limitations set forth
in Section 11.03. Each Guarantor agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be
unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the
Notes or this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any
waiver or consent by any Holder with respect to any provisions hereof or
thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, and action to enforce
the same or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or
equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. Each Guarantor waives diligence,
presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to require a proceeding first
against the Company, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants
that this Note Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete performance
of the obligations contained in the Notes, this Indenture, the Security
Documents and in this Note Guarantee, and waives any and all defenses available
to a surety (other than payment in full). If any Holder or the Trustee is
required by any

                                      -86-
<PAGE>

court or otherwise to return to the Company, any Guarantor, or any custodian,
trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to the Company
or any Guarantor, any amount paid by the Company or any Guarantor to the Trustee
or such Holder, this Note Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall
be reinstated in full force and effect. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as
between each Guarantor, on the one hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the
other hand, (x) the maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be
accelerated as provided in Article 6 for the purposes of this Note Guarantee,
notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such
acceleration in respect of the Obligations guaranteed hereby, and (y) in the
event of any acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6, such
Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and
payable by each Guarantor for the purpose of this Note Guarantee.

                  Section 11.02. Severability.

                           In case any provision of this Note Guarantee shall be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability of
the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

                  Section 11.03. Limitation of Guarantor's Liability.

                           Each Guarantor and by its acceptance hereof each
Holder confirms that it is the intention of all such parties that the guarantee
by such Guarantor pursuant to its Note Guarantee not constitute a fraudulent
transfer or conveyance for purposes of any Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform
Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar
federal or state law. To effectuate the foregoing intention, the Holders and
such Guarantor irrevocably agree that the obligations of such Guarantor under
the Note Guarantee shall be limited to the maximum amount as will, after giving
effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor and after
giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any
other Guarantor in respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under its
Note Guarantee or pursuant to Section 11.05, result in the obligations of such
Guarantor under the Note Guarantee not constituting such fraudulent transfer or
conveyance.

                  Section 11.04. Release of Guarantor.

                  (a)      In the event that all of a Guarantor's obligations
with respect to the CCO Credit Facility and the Related Obligations or other
Indebtedness under clause (1) of the second paragraph of Section 4.10 are
released or discharged, in full, for any reason, including, without limitation,
in connection with the repayment in full of all obligations under the CCO Credit
Facility and the Related Obligations or such other Indebtedness, the Note
Guarantee of such Guarantor will also be automatically released and terminated.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no such release shall be effective
against the Trustee or the Holders if a Default or Event of Default in the
payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes (including in
connection with an offer to purchase) (including as a result of the events
described under clause (7) or (8) of Section 6.01) is in effect or continuing on
the date thereof, or would result therefrom shall have occurred and be
continuing under this Indenture as of the time of such proposed release until
such time as (1) such Default or Event of Default is cured or (2) such release
is consented to by the applicable Holders in accordance with the terms of this
Indenture.

                           The Note Guarantees will be automatically released ab
initio immediately prior to the entry of a Judgment (that remains unstayed) by a
court of competent jurisdiction to the effect that such Note Guarantees (solely
because of the existence of the provisions in the intercreditor agreement to be
entered into between the Trustee on behalf of the Holders and the representative
(the "Representative") of the lenders under the CCO Credit Facility relating to
the Note Guarantees) provide holders of Indebtedness under the CCH II
Indentures, CCI Indentures, CCOH Indentures or Charter Holdings Indentures

                                      -87-
<PAGE>

(as in effect on the Issue Date) the right to accelerate (whether by reason of a
violation of a covenant contained therein or as a result of a cross-acceleration
provision therein tied to a covenant violation under any other such indenture)
the maturity of such debt not otherwise then due, unless at such time such
intercreditor agreement provisions are released by the Representative. Upon
either (i) the entry of any subsequent order overruling or reversing any such
Judgment or (ii) the occurrence of a Default in the payment of principal of,
premium, if any, or interest on the Notes (including in connection with an offer
to purchase) during any period in which such Judgment is being contested by any
affected Parent or Guarantor in accordance with the next succeeding paragraph,
the Note Guarantees shall be automatically reinstated, subject to the provisions
of Section 4.17 and this Section 11.04, as if never released.

                           CCO and the Guarantors will take, and will cause each
Parent to take, all commercially reasonable action to contest, including by
seeking all stays of enforcement and appeals of, any non-final Judgment until
entry of a final, non-appealable Judgment, any notice of default or acceleration
or related claim or proceeding brought by holders of Indebtedness under the CCI
Indentures, the Charter Holdings Indentures, the CCH II Indentures or the CCOH
Indentures. For the purposes of this Section 11.04, a settlement requiring
release of Note Guarantees shall not be deemed commercially reasonable. Any such
release under the preceding paragraph shall not affect the obligations of CCOH,
CCO and its Subsidiaries to continue to provide the security interests in the
Collateral for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders. "Judgment" for
purposes of this Section 11.04 means a judicial order, memorandum or decision.

                  (b)      In addition to release under the circumstances
described in the foregoing clause (a), a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Guarantor shall be released from its obligations under its Note Guarantee with
respect to a particular series of Notes and its obligations under this Indenture
and the Security Documents:

                  (1)      in the event of the Legal Defeasance or Covenant
         Defeasance or discharge of such series of Notes;

                  (2)      upon the dissolution of a Guarantor which is not
         prohibited by the terms of this Indenture;

                  (3)      in the event of a sale or other disposition of all or
         substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor, by way of merger,
         consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or other disposition of all of
         the Equity Interests of such Guarantor then held by the Issuers and
         their Restricted Subsidiaries; provided, however, that such sale or
         disposition otherwise complies with all of the terms of this Indenture,
         including those of Section 4.11; or

                  (4)      if such Guarantor is designated as an Unrestricted
         Subsidiary in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, upon
         effectiveness of such designation or when it first ceases to be a
         Restricted Subsidiary, respectively.

                  (c)      The Trustee shall deliver an appropriate instrument
or instruments evidencing such release upon receipt of a request by the Company
accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel certifying as
to the compliance with this Section 11.04.

                  Section 11.05. Contribution.

                           In order to provide for just and equitable
contribution among the Guarantors, the Guarantors agree, inter se, that in the
event any payment or distribution is made by any Guarantor (a "Funding
Guarantor") under the Note Guarantee, such Funding Guarantor shall be entitled
to a contribution from

                                      -88-
<PAGE>

all other Guarantors in a pro rata amount based on the Adjusted Net Assets (as
defined below) of each Guarantor (including the Funding Guarantor) for all
payments, damages and expenses incurred by that Funding Guarantor in discharging
the Company's obligations with respect to the Notes or any other Guarantor's
obligations with respect to its Note Guarantee. "Adjusted Net Assets" of such
Guarantor at any date shall mean the lesser of the amount by which (x) the fair
value of the property of such Guarantor exceeds the total amount of liabilities,
including, without limitation, contingent liabilities (after giving effect to
all other fixed and contingent liabilities incurred or assumed on such date),
but excluding liabilities under the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor at such
date, and (y) the present fair salable value of the assets of such Guarantor at
such date exceeds the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability
of such Guarantor on its debts (after giving effect to all other fixed and
contingent liabilities incurred or assumed on such date), excluding debt in
respect of the Note Guarantee of such Guarantor, as they become absolute and
matured.

                  Section 11.06. Waiver of Subrogation.

                           Until one year after all obligations are paid in
full, each Guarantor irrevocably waives any claims or other rights which it may
now or hereafter acquire against the Company that arise from the existence,
payment, performance or enforcement of such Guarantor's obligations under its
Note Guarantee and this Indenture, including, without limitation, any right of
subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, indemnification, and any right to
participate in any claim or remedy of any Holder against the Company, whether or
not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or
common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the
Company, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by setoff or in
any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights.
If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the preceding
sentence and the Notes shall not have been paid in full, such amount shall have
been deemed to have been paid to such Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in
trust for the benefit of, the Holders, and shall forthwith be paid to the
Trustee for the benefit of such Holders to be credited and applied upon the
Notes, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this
Indenture. Each Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect
benefits from the financing arrangements contemplated by this Indenture and that
the waiver set forth in this Section 11.06 is knowingly made in contemplation of
such benefits.

                  Section 11.07. Execution of Note Guarantee.

                           To evidence their Note Guarantee to the Holders set
forth in this Article 11, the Guarantors agree on becoming a Guarantor to
execute a Note Guarantee in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit E,
which shall be endorsed on each Note ordered to be authenticated and delivered
by the Trustee. Each Guarantor agrees that its Note Guarantee set forth in this
Article 11 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure to
endorse on each Note a notation of such Note Guarantee. Each such Note Guarantee
shall be signed on behalf of each Guarantor by one of its authorized Officers
prior to the authentication of the Note on which it is endorsed, and the
delivery of such Note by the Trustee, after the authentication thereof
hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of such Note Guarantee on behalf of
such Guarantor. Such signatures upon the Note Guarantee may be by manual or
facsimile signature of such Officer and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced
on the Note Guarantee, and in case any such Officer who shall have signed the
Note Guarantee shall cease to be such Officer before the Note on which such Note
Guarantee is endorsed shall have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee
or disposed of by the Company, such Note nevertheless may be authenticated and
delivered or disposed of as though the Person who signed the Note Guarantee had
not ceased to be such Officer of the Guarantor.

<PAGE>

                  Section 11.08. Waiver of Stay, Extension or Usury Laws.

                           Each Guarantor covenants (to the extent that it may
lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any
manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or
extension law or any usury law or other law that would prohibit or forgive each
such Guarantor from performing its Note Guarantee as contemplated herein,
wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the
covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and (to the extent that it may
lawfully do so) each such Guarantor hereby expressly waives all benefit or
advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or
impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer
and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been
enacted.

                  Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned
to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated.

                           1.       INTEREST. Charter Communications Operating,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Company"), and Charter
Communications Operating Capital Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Capital Corp"
and, together with the Company, the "Issuers"), promise to pay interest on the
principal amount of this Note at the rate of 8% per annum from the Issue Date
until maturity. The Issuers will pay interest semi-annually in arrears on April
30 and October 30 of each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), or if any such
day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day. Interest on the
Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or,
if no interest has been paid, from the date of issuance; provided that if there
is no existing Default in the payment of interest, and if this Note is
authenticated between a record date referred to on the face and the next
succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall accrue from such next
succeeding Interest Payment Date; provided, further, that the first Interest
Payment Date shall be October 30, 2004. The Issuers shall pay interest
(including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on
overdue principal and premium, if any, from time to time on demand at a rate
that is 2% per annum in excess of the rate then in effect; they shall pay
interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any
Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of interest (without regard to any
applicable grace periods) from time to time on demand at the same rate to the
extent lawful. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of
twelve 30-day months.

                           2.       METHOD OF PAYMENT. The Issuers shall pay
interest on the Notes (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are
registered Holders at the close of business on the April 15 or October 15 next
preceding the Interest Payment Date, even if such Notes are canceled after such
record date and on or before such Interest Payment Date, except as provided in
Section 2.12 of the Indenture with respect to defaulted interest. The Notes will
be payable as to principal, premium, if any, and interest at the office or
agency of the Issuers maintained for such purpose within or without the City and
State of New York, or, at the option of the Issuers, payment of interest may be
made by check mailed to the Holders at their addresses set forth in the register
of Holders, and provided that payment by wire transfer of immediately available
funds will be required with respect to principal of and interest and premium on
all Global Notes and all other Notes the Holders of which shall have provided
wire transfer instructions to the Issuers or the Paying Agent. Such payment
shall be in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time
of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.

                           3.       PAYING AGENT AND REGISTRAR. Initially, Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., the Trustee under the Indenture, will act as Paying Agent and
Registrar. The Issuers may change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice
to any Holder. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act in any such
capacity.

                           4. INDENTURE. The Issuers issued the Notes under an
Indenture dated as of April 27, 2004 (the "Indenture") among the Issuers and the
Trustee. The Notes arise out of and are made in accordance with the Indenture,
including the terms stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture
by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (15 U.S. Code
Sections 77aaa-77bbbb). The Holders are referred to the Indenture and such Act
for a complete statement of such terms.

                           5.       OPTIONAL REDEMPTION.

                           (a)      The Issuers may, at any time and from time
to time, at their option, redeem the outstanding Eight Year Notes, in whole or
in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the

                                     A-1-4
<PAGE>

principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
redemption date, plus the Make-Whole Premium.

                           (b)      Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (a)
of this Paragraph 5, at any time prior to April 30, 2007, the Issuers may, on
any one or more occasions, redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal
amount of the Eight Year Notes issued on the Issue Date (including the principal
amount of any Additional Eight Year Notes) issued under the Indenture on a pro
rata basis (or nearly as pro rata as practicable), at a redemption price of
108.000% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity
Offerings; provided, however, that:

                  (i)      at least 65% of the original aggregate principal
         amount of the Eight Year Notes issued on the Issue Date (including the
         principal amount of any Additional Eight Year Notes) issued under the
         Indenture remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such
         redemption (excluding Eight Year Notes held by the Issuers and their
         Subsidiaries); and

                  (ii)     the redemption must occur within 60 days of the date
         of the closing of such Equity Offering.

                           6.       MANDATORY REDEMPTION. Except as otherwise
provided in Paragraph 7 below, the Issuers shall not be required to make
mandatory redemption payments with respect to the Notes.

                           7.       REPURCHASE AT OPTION OF HOLDER.

                  (a)      If there is a Change of Control, the Issuers shall
make an offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to repurchase all or any part (equal
to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof) of each Holder's Notes at a purchase
price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of purchase (the "Change of Control
Payment"). Within 10 days following any Change of Control, the Issuers shall
mail a notice to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase Notes on the Change
of Control Payment Date specified in such notice, pursuant to the procedures
required by the Indenture and described in such notice.

                  (b)      If the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary thereof
consummates any Asset Sale, when the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds
$25.0 million, the Issuers shall commence an offer (an "Asset Sale Offer")
pursuant to Section 4.11 of the Indenture to all Holders and all holders of
other Indebtedness that is of equal priority with the Notes containing
provisions requiring offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of
assets to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other
Indebtedness of equal priority that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds
(which amount includes the entire amount of the Net Proceeds). The offer price
in any Asset Sale Offer will be payable in cash and equal to 100% of principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. If any
Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company
may use such Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the
Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and such other
Indebtedness of equal priority tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the
amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and such other
Indebtedness of equal priority to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon
completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be
reset at zero. Holders that are the subject of an offer to purchase will receive
an Asset Sale Offer from the Issuers prior to any related purchase date and may
elect to have such Notes purchased by completing the form entitled "Option of
Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Notes.

                                     A-1-5
<PAGE>

                           8.       DENOMINATIONS, TRANSFER, EXCHANGE. The Notes
are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000. The transfer of Notes may be registered and Notes may be
exchanged as provided in the Indenture. The Registrar and the Trustee may
require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents and the Issuers may require a Holder to pay any taxes and
fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Issuers need not
exchange or register the transfer of any Note or portion of a Note selected for
redemption, except for the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in
part. Also, the Issuers need not exchange or register the transfer of any Notes
for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or during the
period between a record date and the corresponding Interest Payment Date.

                           9.       PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. The registered Holder
may be treated as its owner for all purposes.

                           10.      AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER. Subject to
certain exceptions, the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the
Security Documents may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or a tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes)
and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 of the Indenture, any existing Default or
compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes (other than any
provision relating to the right of any Holder to bring suit for the enforcement
of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on such Note, on or
after the scheduled due dates expressed in the Notes), the Note Guarantees or
the Security Documents may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including,
without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or a
tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). Without the consent of any Holder,
the Issuers and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes,
the Note Guarantees or the Security Documents to cure any ambiguity, defect or
inconsistency; to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of
certificated Notes; to provide for or confirm the issuance of Additional Notes;
to provide for the assumption of either Issuer's obligations to Holders in the
case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of such Issuer pursuant to Article 5 of the Indenture; to make any change
that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does
not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any Holder; to, if
applicable, comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or maintain
the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA or otherwise as necessary to
comply with applicable law; to release Collateral or a Guarantor, as permitted
under the terms of the Indenture or the Security Documents; to add any
additional assets as Collateral; or to add a Guarantor.

                           11.      DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES. Each of the following
is an Event of Default: (i) default for 30 consecutive days in the payment when
due of interest on this series of Notes, (ii) default in payment when due of the
principal of or premium, if any, on this series of Notes, (iii) failure by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply with Sections 4.16 and
5.01 of the Indenture, (iv) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries for 30 consecutive days after written notice thereof has been given
to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders
of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding to
comply with any of its other covenants or agreements in the Indenture, (v)
default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money
borrowed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of
which is guaranteed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries),
whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or is created after the date
of the Indenture, if that default: (a) is caused by a failure to pay at final
stated maturity the principal amount of such Indebtedness prior to the
expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness on the date of such
default (a "Payment Default"); or (b) results

                                     A-1-6
<PAGE>

in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity, and, in
each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates
$100 million or more, (vi) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to pay final judgments which are non-appealable aggregating in
excess of $100 million (net of applicable insurance which has not been denied in
writing by the insurer), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for
a period of 60 days, (vii) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with
respect to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, (viii) any Note
Guarantee of any Guarantor that, taken together with all other such Guarantors,
would be a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other
than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and such Note Guarantee) or
is declared null and void and unenforceable or found to be invalid or any
Guarantor denies its liability under its Note Guarantee with respect to any
series of Notes (other than by reason of release of a Guarantor from its Note
Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and such Note
Guarantee), and (ix) so long as the Security Documents securing any series of
Notes have not otherwise been terminated in accordance with their terms or the
Collateral as a whole has not otherwise been released from the Lien of the
Security Documents securing any series of Notes in accordance with the terms
thereof, (a) any default by the Company or any Subsidiary in the performance of
its obligations under the Security Documents securing any series of Notes (after
the lapse of any applicable grace periods) or the Indenture which adversely
affects the enforceability, validity, perfection or priority of the Trustee's
Lien on the Collateral or which adversely affects the condition or value of the
Collateral, taken as a whole, in any material respect, (b) repudiation or
disaffirmation by the Company or any Subsidiary of its respective obligations
under the Security Documents securing any series of Notes and (c) the
determination in a judicial proceeding that the Security Documents securing such
series of Notes are unenforceable or invalid against the Company or any
Subsidiary for any reason. In the case of an Event of Default arising from
certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company, all
outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice.
In the case of an Event of Default described in the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii) as to this series of Notes, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes then outstanding may declare
such series of Notes due and payable immediately. If any other Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuers or the Holders of
at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the
Issuers and the Trustee may declare all the Notes to be due and payable. Holders
may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.
Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of
any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any
continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default
relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest) if it
determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice
to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any
existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture
except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on,
premium, if any, or the principal of, the Notes. The Issuers are required to
deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the
Indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuers
are required to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or
Event of Default.

                           12.      TRUSTEE DEALINGS WITH ISSUERS. The Trustee
in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes
and may otherwise deal with the Issuers or any Affiliate of the Issuers with the
same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.

                           13.      NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS. A director,
officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member or stockholder of either of the
Issuers, director, officer or employee incorporator or stockholder of CCI as
manager of the Issuers as such, shall not have any liability for any obligations
of the Issuers under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by

                                     A-1-7
<PAGE>

reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note
waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for the issuance of the Notes.

                           14.      GOVERNING LAW. THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN AND BE USED TO CONSTRUE THIS NOTE AND THE
INDENTURE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF
LAWS TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION
WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO AND THE HOLDERS AGREE TO
SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN ANY ACTION
OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS NOTE.

                           15.      AUTHENTICATION. This Note shall not be valid
until authenticated by the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating
agent.

                           16.      ABBREVIATIONS. Customary abbreviations may
be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in
common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with
right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and
U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).

                           17.      ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF RESTRICTED
GLOBAL NOTES AND RESTRICTED DEFINITIVE NOTES. In addition to the rights provided
to Holders under the Indenture, Holders of Restricted Global Notes and
Restricted Definitive Notes shall have all the rights set forth in any
Registration Rights Agreement.

                           18.      CUSIP NUMBERS. Pursuant to a recommendation
promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the
Issuers have caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes and the Trustee may
use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No
representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on
the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed
only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.

                           19.      REGISTRATION RIGHTS. PURSUANT TO A
REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY AND THE GUARANTORS WILL BE OBLIGATED
UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS TO CONSUMMATE AN EXCHANGE OFFER PURSUANT

WITH THE TERMS OF SUCH REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT.(4)

                  Capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings assigned
to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated.

                           1.       INTEREST. Charter Communications Operating,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Company"), and Charter
Communications Operating Capital Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Capital Corp"
and, together with the Company, the "Issuers"), promise to pay interest on the
principal amount of this Note at the rate of 8-3/8% per annum from the Issue
Date until maturity. The Issuers will pay interest semi-annually in arrears on
April 30 and October 30 of each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), or if
any such day is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day.
Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date to which interest
has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the date of issuance;
provided that if there is no existing Default in the payment of interest, and if
this Note is authenticated between a record date referred to on the face and the
next succeeding Interest Payment Date, interest shall accrue from such next
succeeding Interest Payment Date; provided, further, that the first Interest
Payment Date shall be October 30, 2004. The Issuers shall pay interest
(including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law) on
overdue principal and premium, if any, from time to time on demand at a rate
that is 2% per annum in excess of the rate then in effect; they shall pay
interest (including post-petition interest in any proceeding under any
Bankruptcy Law) on overdue installments of interest (without regard to any
applicable grace periods) from time to time on demand at the same rate to the
extent lawful. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of
twelve 30-day months.

                           2.       METHOD OF PAYMENT. The Issuers shall pay
interest on the Notes (except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are
registered Holders at the close of business on the April 15 or October 15 next
preceding the Interest Payment Date, even if such Notes are canceled after such
record date and on or before such Interest Payment Date, except as provided in
Section 2.12 of the Indenture with respect to defaulted interest. The Notes will
be payable as to principal, premium, if any, and interest at the office or
agency of the Issuers maintained for such purpose within or without the City and
State of New York, or, at the option of the Issuers, payment of interest may be
made by check mailed to the Holders at their addresses set forth in the register
of Holders, and provided that payment by wire transfer of immediately available
funds will be required with respect to principal of and interest and premium on
all Global Notes and all other Notes the Holders of which shall have provided
wire transfer instructions to the Issuers or the Paying Agent. Such payment
shall be in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time
of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.

                           3.       PAYING AGENT AND REGISTRAR. Initially, Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., the Trustee under the Indenture, will act as Paying Agent and
Registrar. The Issuers may change any Paying Agent or Registrar without notice
to any Holder. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act in any such
capacity.

                           4.       INDENTURE. The Issuers issued the Notes
under an Indenture dated as of April 27, 2004 (the "Indenture") among the
Issuers and the Trustee. The Notes arise out of and are made in accordance with
the Indenture, including the terms stated in the Indenture and those made part
of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (15
U.S. Code Sections 77aaa-77bbbb). The Holders are referred to the Indenture and
such Act for a complete statement of such terms.

                           5.       OPTIONAL REDEMPTION.

                           (a)      Except as set forth in clause (b) of this
Paragraph 5, the Issuers shall not have the option to redeem the Ten Year Notes
pursuant to this Paragraph 5 prior to April 30, 2009. Thereafter, the Issuers
shall have the option to redeem the Ten Year Notes, in whole or in part, upon
not

                                     A-2-4

less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the redemption prices (expressed
as percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the
twelve-month period beginning on April 30 of the years indicated below:

</TABLE>

                           (b)      Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (a)
of this Paragraph 5, at any time prior to April 30, 2007, the Issuers may, on
any one or more occasions, redeem up to 35% of the original aggregate principal
amount of the Ten Year Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional
Ten Year Notes) issued under this Indenture on a pro rata basis (or nearly as
pro rata as practicable), at a redemption price of 108.375% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption
date, with the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings; provided,
however, that:

                  (i)      at least 65% of the original aggregate principal
         amount of Ten Year Notes (including the principal amount of any
         Additional Ten Year Notes) issued under the Indenture remains
         outstanding immediately after the occurrence of such redemption
         (excluding Ten Year Notes held by the Company and its Subsidiaries);
         and

                  (ii)     the redemption must occur within 60 days of the date
         of the closing of such Equity Offering.

                           6.       MANDATORY REDEMPTION. Except as otherwise
provided in Paragraph 7 below, the Issuers shall not be required to make
mandatory redemption payments with respect to the Notes.

                           7.       REPURCHASE AT OPTION OF HOLDER.

                           (a)      If there is a Change of Control, the Issuers
shall make an offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to repurchase all or any part
(equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof) of each Holder's Notes at a
purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of purchase (the
"Change of Control Payment"). Within 10 days following any Change of Control,
the Issuers shall mail a notice to each Holder describing the transaction or
transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase
Notes on the Change of Control Payment Date specified in such notice, pursuant
to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice.

                           (b)      If the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
thereof consummates any Asset Sale, when the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds
exceeds $25.0 million, the Issuers shall commence an offer (an "Asset Sale
Offer") pursuant to Section 4.11 of the Indenture to all Holders and all holders
of other Indebtedness that is of equal priority with the Notes containing
provisions requiring offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of sales of
assets to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such other
Indebtedness of equal priority that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds
(which amount includes the entire amount of the Net Proceeds). The offer price
in any Asset Sale Offer will be payable in cash and equal to 100% of principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. If any
Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the

                                     A-2-5
<PAGE>

Company may use such Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by
the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and such other
Indebtedness of equal priority tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the
amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall select the Notes and such other
Indebtedness of equal priority to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon
completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be
reset at zero. Holders that are the subject of an offer to purchase will receive
an Asset Sale Offer from the Issuers prior to any related purchase date and may
elect to have such Notes purchased by completing the form entitled "Option of
Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Notes.

                           8.       DENOMINATIONS, TRANSFER, EXCHANGE. The Notes
are in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000. The transfer of Notes may be registered and Notes may be
exchanged as provided in the Indenture. The Registrar and the Trustee may
require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and
transfer documents and the Issuers may require a Holder to pay any taxes and
fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The Issuers need not
exchange or register the transfer of any Note or portion of a Note selected for
redemption, except for the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in
part. Also, the Issuers need not exchange or register the transfer of any Notes
for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed or during the
period between a record date and the corresponding Interest Payment Date.

                           9.       PERSONS DEEMED OWNERS. The registered Holder
may be treated as its owner for all purposes.

                           10.      AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER. Subject to
certain exceptions, the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the
Security Documents may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or a tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes)
and, subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 of the Indenture, any existing Default or
compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes (other than any
provision relating to the right of any Holder to bring suit for the enforcement
of any payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on such Note, on or
after the scheduled due dates expressed in the Notes), the Note Guarantees or
the Security Documents may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including,
without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or a
tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). Without the consent of any Holder,
the Issuers and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes,
the Note Guarantees or the Security Documents to cure any ambiguity, defect or
inconsistency; to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of
certificated Notes; to provide for or confirm the issuance of Additional Notes;
to provide for the assumption of either Issuer's obligations to Holders in the
case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of such Issuer pursuant to Article 5 of the Indenture; to make any change
that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or that does
not adversely affect the legal rights under the Indenture of any Holder; to, if
applicable, comply with requirements of the SEC in order to, if applicable,
effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA or otherwise
as necessary to comply with applicable law; to release Collateral or a
Guarantor, as permitted under the terms of the Indenture or the Security
Documents; to add any additional assets as Collateral; or to add a Guarantor.

                           11.      DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES. Each of the following
is an Event of Default: (i) default for 30 consecutive days in the payment when
due of interest on this series of Notes, (ii) default in payment when due of the
principal of or premium, if any, on this series of Notes, (iii) failure by the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply with Sections 4.16 and
5.01 of the Indenture, (iv) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries for 30 consecutive days after written

                                     A-2-6
<PAGE>

notice thereof has been given to the Company by the Trustee or to the Company
and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes outstanding to comply with any of its other covenants or agreements
in the Indenture, (v) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under
which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any
Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or guarantee now exists or
is created after the date of the Indenture, if that default: (a) is caused by a
failure to pay at final stated maturity the principal amount of such
Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such
Indebtedness on the date of such default (a "Payment Default"); or (b) results
in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity, and, in
each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates
$100 million or more, (vi) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to pay final judgments which are non-appealable aggregating in
excess of $100 million (net of applicable insurance which has not been denied in
writing by the insurer), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for
a period of 60 days, (vii) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with
respect to the Company or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, (viii) any Note
Guarantee of any Guarantor that, taken together with all other such Guarantors,
would be a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other
than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and such Note Guarantee) or
is declared null and void and unenforceable or found to be invalid or any
Guarantor denies its liability under its Note Guarantee with respect to any
series of Notes (other than by reason of release of a Guarantor from its Note
Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and such Note
Guarantee), and (ix) so long as the Security Documents securing any series of
Notes have not otherwise been terminated in accordance with their terms or the
Collateral as a whole has not otherwise been released from the Lien of the
Security Documents securing any series of Notes in accordance with the terms
thereof, (a) any default by the Company or any Subsidiary in the performance of
its obligations under the Security Documents securing any series of Notes (after
the lapse of any applicable grace periods) or the Indenture which adversely
affects the enforceability, validity, perfection or priority of the Trustee's
Lien on the Collateral or which adversely affects the condition or value of the
Collateral, taken as a whole, in any material respect, (b) repudiation or
disaffirmation by the Company or any Subsidiary of its respective obligations
under the Security Documents securing any series of Notes and (c) the
determination in a judicial proceeding that the Security Documents securing such
series of Notes are unenforceable or invalid against the Company or any
Subsidiary for any reason. In the case of an Event of Default arising from
certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company, all
outstanding Notes will become due and payable without further action or notice.
In the case of an Event of Default described in the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii) as to this series of Notes, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes then outstanding may declare
such series of Notes due and payable immediately. If any other Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuers or the Holders of
at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the
Issuers and the Trustee may declare all the Notes to be due and payable. Holders
may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.
Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of
any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any
continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default
relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest) if it
determines that withholding notice is in their interest. The Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice
to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any
existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture
except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest on,
premium, if any, or the principal of, the Notes. The Issuers are required to
deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the
Indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuers
are required to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or
Event of Default.

                           12.      TRUSTEE DEALINGS WITH ISSUERS. The Trustee
in its individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Notes
and may otherwise deal with the Issuers or any Affiliate of the Issuers with the
same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.

                           13.      NO RECOURSE AGAINST OTHERS. A director,
officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member or stockholder of either of the
Issuers, director, officer or employee incorporator or stockholder of CCI as
manager of the Issuers as such, shall not have any liability for any obligations
of the Issuers under the Notes or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by
accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release
are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Notes.

                           14.      GOVERNING LAW. THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN AND BE USED TO CONSTRUE THIS NOTE AND THE
INDENTURE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF
LAWS TO THE EXTENT THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION
WOULD BE REQUIRED THEREBY. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO AND THE HOLDERS AGREE TO
SUBMIT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN ANY ACTION
OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS NOTE.

                           15.      AUTHENTICATION. This Note shall not be valid
until authenticated by the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating
agent.

                           16.      ABBREVIATIONS. Customary abbreviations may
be used in the name of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in
common), TEN ENT (= tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with
right of survivorship and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and
U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts to Minors Act).

                           17.      ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF HOLDERS OF RESTRICTED
GLOBAL NOTES AND RESTRICTED DEFINITIVE NOTES. In addition to the rights provided
to Holders under the Indenture, Holders of Restricted Global Notes and
Restricted Definitive Notes shall have all the rights set forth in any
Registration Rights Agreement.

                           18.      CUSIP NUMBERS. Pursuant to a recommendation
promulgated by the Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the
Issuers have caused CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes and the Trustee may
use CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No
representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on
the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed
only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.

                           19.      REGISTRATION RIGHTS. PURSUANT TO A
REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY AND THE GUARANTORS WILL BE OBLIGATED
UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS TO CONSUMMATE AN EXCHANGE OFFER PURSUANT
TO WHICH THE HOLDER OF THIS NOTE SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXCHANGE THIS NOTE FOR

REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT.(9)

                           20.      SECURITY. THE COMPANY HAS GRANTED, AND
CERTAIN OTHER ENTITIES MAY GRANT IN THE FUTURE, LIENS ON CERTAIN OF THEIR ASSETS
TO THE TRUSTEE PURSUANT TO THE SECURITY DOCUMENTS. THE LIENS ARE SUBJECT TO
RELEASE UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE AND THE SECURITY
DOCUMENTS. THE COMPANY WILL EXECUTE AND COMPLY WITH, AND CAUSE EACH OF ITS
SUBSIDIARIES TO EXECUTE AND COMPLY WITH, THE TERMS OF EACH SECURITY DOCUMENT TO
WHICH SUCH PERSON IS, OR IS REQUIRED TO BE, A PARTY.

                           21.      OTHER REFERENCED AGREEMENTS. PURSUANT TO
SECTION 7.12 OF THE INDENTURE, THE TRUSTEE ON BEHALF OF EACH PRESENT AND FUTURE

         Restricted Definitive Note, the Owner further certifies that it is
         either (x) a non-U.S. Person to whom Notes could be transferred in
         accordance with Regulation S or (y) a U.S. Person who purchased Notes
         in a transaction that did not require registration under the Securities
         Act. Upon consummation of the proposed Exchange in accordance with the
         terms of the Indenture, the Restricted

         on transfer enumerated in the Private Placement Legend printed on the
         Restricted Definitive Note and in the Indenture and the Securities Act.

         (b)      Check if Exchange is from Restricted Definitive Note to

         Exchange of the Owner's Restricted Definitive Note for a beneficial
         interest in the [CHECK ONE] Rule 144A Global Note or Regulation S
         Global Note with an equal principal amount, the Owner hereby certifies
         (i) the beneficial interest is being acquired for the Owner's own
         account without transfer and (ii) such Exchange has been effected in
         compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Restricted
         Global Notes and pursuant to and in accordance with the Securities Act,
         and in compliance with any applicable blue sky securities laws of any
         state of the United States. Upon consummation of the proposed Exchange
         in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the beneficial interest
         issued will be subject to the restrictions on transfer enumerated in
         the Private Placement Legend printed on the relevant Restricted Global
         Note and in the Indenture and the Securities Act.
