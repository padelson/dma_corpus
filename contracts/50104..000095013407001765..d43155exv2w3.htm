Following Closing, representatives of Purchaser and Sellers shall meet periodically to determine

receipt of closure letters or no further action letters from any Agency with regard to the
environmental conditions at the Sites pursuant to Article&nbsp;7. Any such reduction shall be applied
first to the Deeds of Trust and the Funds and then to the letter of credit. If the parties cannot
mutually agree to a reduction of the Security Amount of the Deeds of Trust, the amount of the Funds
or the amount of the letter of credit, then either party may elect to arbitrate such issue.
Sellers may from time to time with Purchaser&#146;s prior written consent, which shall not unreasonably

claimant under applicable underground storage tank fund reimbursement laws. Sellers and Purchaser
agree that Sellers, at Sellers&#146; own expense, are responsible and liable for any Corrective Action
at these Sites for Releases, whether known or unknown, that occurred prior to the Closing Date. At
Sellers&#146; own expense, Sellers will administer and pursue reimbursement for such Corrective Action
work under applicable underground storage tank fund reimbursement laws. Sellers and Purchaser
further agree that as of the Closing Date, Purchaser has the option to assume Corrective Action at
Sites covered by this Section&nbsp;7.5.2 to the extent allowed by the applicable law. If Purchaser
assumes Corrective Action at a Site covered under this Section&nbsp;7.5.2, Sellers will take all
appropriate action necessary to ensure Purchaser obtains Sellers&#146; reimbursement rights subject to
the requirements of the applicable underground storage tank fund reimbursement laws and to the
extent allowed by applicable law. Sellers and Purchaser may participate in Corrective Action for
any of these Sites, as the eligible underground storage tank fund claimant. For example, costs of
Corrective Action for a Site paid by Purchaser while Sellers are the Claimant for said Site are to
be considered paid on behalf of Sellers with any proceeds reimbursed to Purchaser upon
reimbursement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">If either Sellers or Purchaser discovers on or before the Closing that any representation or
warranty made by it or the other was or becomes not true and correct in any material respect, it
shall so notify the other in writing. The representations and warranties made in this Agreement
shall be deemed to be modified by any matter contained in such notice. In the case of any such
change in the representations or warranties by Sellers, (a)&nbsp;if the cumulative changes so made would
adversely affect the fair market value of the Assets as currently operated by ONE MILLION DOLLARS
($1,000,000) or more, Purchaser may object thereto by written notice to Sellers within ten (10)
business days after receipt of the notice and (b)&nbsp;if the cumulative changes so made would adversely
affect the fair market value of the Assets as currently operated by TWENTY-SEVEN MILLION SEVEN
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($27,700,000) or more, Purchaser and Sellers shall each have the right to
terminate this Agreement. If such objection notice is not given within the ten business day period,
or the cumulative changes do not have such adverse effect, then such change shall not give rise to
any right or remedy. If such objection notice is timely given and the effect of the cumulative
changes on the operations of any Site or the adverse affect on the fair market value of the Assets
exceeds such $1,000,000 amount, and Sellers determine that they cannot cure such adverse effect
prior to the Closing applicable to the Site(s) in question by using commercially reasonable
efforts, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith a reduction of the Purchase Price to fairly
reflect the impact of the adverse change on the fair market value of the Assets. In the event that
the parties are unable to agree on a reduction of the Purchase Price prior to the Closing, then the
parties agree that either party shall have the right to elect either to (i)&nbsp;unless the Site has
been deleted by either party pursuant to subparagraph (ii)&nbsp;below, submit the matter (that is, the
amount that the Purchase Price should be reduced to reflect the diminution of the value of the
Assets) to arbitration under Article&nbsp;27 for resolution after the Closing or (ii)&nbsp;delete the Site(s)
in question from the Assets, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced at the Closing for each such
Site in the amount of ONE MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,800,000); provided, further,

the applicable Closing date for the Site(s), which Purchaser shall hold for Sellers as a bailee,

in escrow the portion of the License Consideration and the Liquor Inventory consideration
attributable to such Site(s). Sellers shall transfer title to the Liquor Inventory at each Site to
Purchaser upon completion of transfer of the Liquor License for the Site. Upon such transfer,
Purchaser or the ABC Escrow Holder, as applicable, shall distribute to Sellers the License
Consideration and the Liquor Inventory consideration for the Site, less any amounts paid to

Assets is not conditioned upon transfer of the Liquor Licenses or the Liquor Inventory; provided,
however, that the closing of the purchase and sale of the Assets shall be a condition precedent to
transfer of the Liquor Licenses and the Liquor Inventory. In the event that any of the Liquor
Licenses are not transferred on or before the date three months after the Closing Date for any
Site, then (i)&nbsp;to the extent previously deposited by Purchaser with escrow, ABC Escrow Holder shall
return the License Consideration and the Liquor Inventory consideration for the particular Sites to
Purchaser (without interest) and neither Party shall have any further obligation with respect to
the transfer of the Liquor Licenses for the affected Sites and (ii)&nbsp;Purchaser shall either return
to Sellers the Liquor Inventory held by Purchaser as a bailee from the date of Closing or pay to
Sellers the cash value of the Liquor Inventory (without interest) as of the date of Closing for the
affected Sites. All escrow costs shall be divided equally between Sellers and Purchaser. Purchaser
shall be responsible for all license fees and transfer fees in connection with the transfer of the
Liquor Licenses.

Purchaser may assign its rights under this Agreement or designate a nominee to take title to the

liabilities, and shall be responsible for discharging all obligations relating to the ownership
and/or operation of the Assets prior to the Closing, whether by any Seller or prior owners of the

liabilities arising during or prior to Purchaser&#146;s previous ownership), as set forth in this
Agreement, including matters shown on <U>Exhibit&nbsp;U</U> and <U>Exhibit&nbsp;V.</U> Except as expressly
provided elsewhere in this Agreement, including the specific limitations on environmental
liabilities set forth in Article&nbsp;7, Sellers shall jointly and severally assume, discharge, protect
(with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser), indemnify and hold Purchaser, its parent,
subsidiaries and Affiliates and their respective officers, employees, attorneys, business
invitees, guests, customers, contractors and agents harmless from and against each and every
liability in any way pertaining or relating to (i)&nbsp;a breach of any representation or warranty of
any Seller contained herein, either as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date, subject to
the provisions pertaining to representations and warranties in this Article&nbsp;31 below, (ii)&nbsp;a
breach of any covenant contained herein, (iii)&nbsp;any Taxes of Sellers or (iv)&nbsp;the Assets, or any
portion thereof or any interest therein, including, without limitation, the use, ownership or
operation of the Assets by any person (including, without limitation, Sellers and any prior owner
of the Assets other than, with regards to Assets previously owned by Purchaser, Purchaser and all
owners prior to Purchaser&#146;s previous ownership) arising on or before the Closing or existing as of
the Closing applicable to the Asset in question or arising thereafter with respect to any period
of time prior thereto. Except as otherwise provided in the Trademark License Agreement with
respect to Sellers&#146; use of the Licensed Trademarks, Purchaser shall assume, discharge, indemnify
and hold Sellers, its parent, subsidiaries and Affiliates and their respective officers,
employees, attorneys, business invitees, guests, customers, contractors and agents harmless from
and against each and every liability in any way pertaining or relating to the Assets, or any
portion thereof or any interest therein, arising for the first time after the Closing and with
respect to any period of time subsequent thereto that Purchaser owns the Assets. The foregoing is
not intended to waive, and shall not constitute a waiver by Purchaser, of Purchaser&#146;s rights

be performed and complied with by Sellers. Furthermore, in the event of such a breach by any
Seller, Sellers&#146; liability shall not be in any way satisfied, reduced or excused by virtue of any
rights granted to Purchaser to investigate the Assets or by any information which Purchaser may
acquire by virtue of such investigation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, except with respect to Sellers&#146; title and Tax representations and warranties (to which
none of the limitations set forth in this sentence applies), Sellers&#146; aggregate liability for
indemnification with respect to all Claims by Purchaser for breach of representations and
warranties under or related to this Agreement (i)&nbsp;shall be conditioned on a Claim being made
therefore by Purchaser within 18&nbsp;months after the Closing Date; (ii)&nbsp;shall not apply unless the
aggregate damage amount of all Claims shall exceed ONE MILLION DOLLARS ($1,000,000), in which case
only the aggregate damage amount exceeding ONE MILLION DOLLARS ($1,000,000) shall be indemnified,
and (iii)&nbsp;shall not exceed SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS ($70,000,000). For the avoidance of doubt, none
of Sellers&#146; indemnities under this Agreement (other than clause (i)&nbsp;above for breach of
representations and warranties), and none of Sellers&#146; covenants under this Agreement, shall be
subject to the limitations of the immediately preceding sentence. Neither party shall have
liability under this Agreement for exemplary or punitive damages or damages for lost profits,
except those awarded to a third party. The rights and obligations conferred by this Article&nbsp;31
constitute contractual obligations of Sellers and Purchaser to one another and are not intended to
confer on any other third party, except successors or assignees of Purchaser as provided in this
Agreement, any benefit or right to enforce. Nothing in this Article&nbsp;31 shall limit any liability
with respect to fraud. With regard to any indemnity claim concerning representations and
warranties for title, Purchaser shall first be required to pursue such claim against the Title
Policy.

the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity, question of intent or question of

OPERATIBILITY OF ANY OF THE ASSETS, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR OF
FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR OR ORDINARY USES OR PURPOSES. PURCHASER HEREBY WAIVES THE UNIFORM

hereinabove, Sellers and Purchaser agree to waive compliance with any applicable bulk sales laws.
Sellers shall indemnify, defend and protect (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser)
Purchaser and its Affiliates against, and shall hold them harmless from, and pay, any and all
losses, penalties, costs, expenses, damages and liabilities arising out of or resulting from any
failure to comply with or perform any action in connection with such bulk sales provisions as they
apply to the transfer of the Assets consistent with this Agreement. Sellers shall comply with the
bulk sales tax notice requirement of the State of California.

reduce the Purchase Price by the amount of $1,800,000 per Site. Purchaser and Sellers have chosen
this $1,800,000 number at random, and such number shall in no way be attributed as the value the
parties assigned to any particular Sites, but rather as a mechanism to facilitate the Closing. The
actual value of any particular Site is to be determined post-closing by the parties hereto, and if
said parties are unable to agree on said values, by the arbitrator in accordance with Article&nbsp;27
above.

and several and each Seller shall be fully liable for the obligations of Sellers hereunder. The
obligation of each Seller under this Agreement shall be direct and independent of and not secondary
to the obligations of any other Seller. Each Seller expressly waives any right to require
Purchaser to (i)&nbsp;proceed against any other Seller or any other person; (ii)&nbsp;proceed against or
exhaust any security or (iii)&nbsp;pursue any other remedy. Purchaser may exercise or not exercise any
right or remedy it has against any other Seller or any security it holds (including the right to
foreclose by judicial or nonjudicial sale) without affecting any Seller&#146;s liability hereunder. Each
Seller further expressly waives any rights to participate in any security held by Purchaser, any
demands for performance, notices of nonperformance or the benefit of any act or omission by
Purchaser which directly or indirectly results in or aids the discharge of any other Seller from

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">any of the obligations under this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise. Each Seller
acknowledges that, to the extent such Seller has or may have rights of subrogation or reimbursement
against any other Seller for claims arising out of this Agreement, those rights may be impaired or
destroyed if Purchaser elects to proceed against any real property security of such other Seller by
non-judicial foreclosure. That impairment or destruction could, under certain judicial cases and
based on equitable principles of estoppel, give rise to a defense by a Seller against its
obligations under this Agreement. Each Seller waives that defense and any others arising from
Purchaser&#146;s election to pursue non-judicial foreclosure. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each Seller expressly waives all rights, benefits and defenses, if any, applicable or
available to it under either California Code of Civil Procedure Sections&nbsp;580a or 726, which
provide, among other things, that the amount of any deficiency judgment which may be recovered
following either a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure sale is limited to the difference between
the amount of any indebtedness owed and the greater of the fair value of the security or the amount
for which the security was actually sold. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Seller further expressly waives all rights, benefits and defenses, if any, applicable or available
to it under either California Code of Civil Procedure Sections&nbsp;580b, providing that no deficiency
may be recovered on a real property purchase money obligation, or 580d, providing that no
deficiency may be recovered on an obligation secured by a deed of trust on real property if the
real property is sold under a power of sale contained in the deed of trust. No failure on the part
of Purchaser to exercise, no delay in exercising and no course of dealing with respect to, any
right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.
No compromise, settlement, release, renewal, extension, indulgence, change in, waiver or
modification of any of the obligations under this Agreement, or the release or discharge of any
other Seller from its performance of any of the obligations of Sellers hereunder shall release or
discharge any Seller from the performance of the obligations hereunder.
