 1.2 Excluded Property. 

  

 Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the Assets (and any defined term for any property included in the Assets) exclude all assets and properties of Sellers not set forth in Section 1.1, including without limitation the following (collectively, the "Excluded Property"):

 1.3 Experienced Purchaser. Purchaser is experienced in the operation of properties like the Assets and is familiar with the risks involved in owning and operating properties like the Assets, and is not relying on Sellers to furnish Purchaser any information as to such ownership and operational risks; provided, however, this Section 1.3 is in no way intended to, nor shall it, eliminate Purchasers ability to rely on the representations, warranties and covenants of Sellers set forth in this Agreement, nor to excuse Sellers from the disclosure obligations under applicable law for a commercial property disclosure report concerning special flood hazard area, area of potential flooding, very high fire hazard severity zone, wildland-state responsibility area, earthquake fault zone, and seismic hazard zone. 

  

 1.4 Branded Sites. The Sites currently branded Chevron or Shell are identified in  _Exhibit A_ (the "Branded Sites"). The parties agree that the Branded Sites shall be debranded. Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts, including payment of any sums that must be paid, to cause such Branded Sites to be debranded at Closing, change all trade dress to soft USA Petroleum trade dress consistent with industry standards for soft branding and terminate all existing agreements with Chevron or Shell relating to the Branded Sites, including without limitation branding agreements and fuel supply agreements. If such branding agreements and fuel supply agreements cannot be terminated at or before Closing, then all existing agreements with Chevron or Shell shall be assigned to Purchaser or in the event that Chevron and/or Shell refuse to approve such assignment, the parties shall mutually agree to a method of operation and accounting for the Branded Sites that approximates the value to Purchaser which Purchaser would have received if such Sites had been debranded on or before Closing, but without liability to Sellers for any difference to Purchaser for its costs of fuel to an unbranded Site as compared to the fuel costs for the Branded Sites under the Chevron or Shell fuel supply agreement. In the event that such debranding does not take place on or before Closing, Sellers shall diligently continue to pursue such debranding after the Closing. All costs and expenses in connection with the debranding actions contemplated by this Section 1.4 shall be borne by Sellers. 

  

ARTICLE 2 

   

PURCHASE PRICE  

  

 2.1 Purchase Price. In consideration of the Assets, Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the total of the following: 

  

 2.1.1 For the transfer, sale and assignment by Sellers of the Assets other than those Assets listed elsewhere in this Section 2.1, TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY-SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ($277,000,000) as adjusted pursuant to Sections 3.4.1.9, 5.7 and 14.6 and Articles 7, 8, 9 and 10, if applicable; 

   

 2.1.2 For the Inventory, an amount to be determined in accordance with the provisions of Article 17 (the "Inventory Price"). 

   

 2.1.3 For the Drawer Cash, an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the Drawer Cash specified in Section 1.1.1.9 (the "Cash Amount"). 

    ##### 

  

     

 2.1.4 For the Deposits, an amount equal to the aggregate dollar amount thereof set forth in _Exhibit F_ (the "Deposit Amount"). 

   

The aggregate amount payable pursuant to this Section 2.1 is referred to as
the "Purchase Price." The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
Purchase Price is the result of an arms-length negotiation, and does not
reflect any discount or reduction for the existence of any known or unknown
contamination on, in, under or around the Sites. 

  

 2.2 Payment. The Purchase Price shall be payable as follows: 

  

 2.2.1 Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall deposit in a bank account designated by Sellers for their joint account wire-transferred funds in the amount of FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ($5,000,000) (the "Earnest Money Deposit"). At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay Sellers in immediately available funds the Purchase Price Balance (as defined in Section 2.2.2),with the Earnest Money Deposit being applied and credited toward payment of the Purchase Price.

 3.4.1.1 Article 8 shall have been complied with and the Title Company remains committed to issue the Title Policies pursuant to Section 8.2; 

  

 3.4.1.2 All items required to be delivered by Sellers into Escrow have been delivered to Escrow Holder pursuant to Section 3.2.1;

 3.4.1.6 Sellers shall have complied with the requirements of Article 23 hereof; 

  

 3.4.1.7 There shall not be in effect any order from a court or governmental authority having jurisdiction over the parties or the Assets barring the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement nor any litigation or proceeding by any federal or state governmental agency to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 3.4.1.8 There shall not be pending or threatened any litigation or proceeding instituted by any federal, state or foreign governmental authority to restrain, prohibit or otherwise interfere with or obtain substantial monetary damages in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operation of the Sites by Purchaser after the Closing Date;

   ##### 

  

 

fair market value of the Site, (ii) the parties shall mutually work together

days following Closing and continue to seek the consent of such Landlord and
(iii) if consent is not obtained, within the time stated above, Sellers shall

 3.4.1.15 Purchaser shall have received written evidence reasonably satisfactory to it in form and substance that any partnership, joint venture or similar arrangement applicable to the Site identified as facility #879 on _Exhibit A_ shall have been duly terminated on or before the Closing without liability to Purchaser; 

   ##### 

  

  

 3.4.1.16 Sellers shall have delivered to Purchaser a letter of credit of a bank reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser in the amount of FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ($5,000,000) drawable from time to time by Purchaser by tendering its certificate that Sellers have breached any covenant, representation and/or warranty in or under this Agreement, prior to, at or after the Closing that give rise to an indemnifiable claim under Article 31, subject to all limitations and restrictions under such Article 31, (collectively, the "Agreement Obligations") and that such breach remains uncured thirty (30) or more days after Purchaser has given Sellers written notice thereof and that the amount drawn, together with any prior draw(s), does not exceed Purchasers good faith estimate of the damages to it and its Affiliates resulting from all such indemnifiable claims, and containing 10-year evergreen renewal provisions and other terms reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser; provided, however, that with respect to any individual proposed draw on the letter of credit by Purchaser in an amount under $100,000, Purchaser shall give Sellers notice thereof not less than 5 business days prior to any such draw and will not make such draw if Sellers wire transfer the entire amount of the proposed draw to Purchaser on or before the close of business on such 5th business day; 

  

 3.4.1.17 Sellers shall have delivered to Purchaser, within ten (10) days after the Effective Date, profit and loss statements for the 36 months ended September 30, 2006 (the "Financial Statements") and such profit and loss statements shall not disclose any material inconsistency with the 18-month report heretofore delivered to Purchaser; and 

  

 3.4.1.18 To secure the Agreement Obligations of the Seller furnishing the same, one or more Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser at the Closing either (at Sellers election) (i) deeds of trust in customary form (the "Deeds of Trust"), providing a first lien to Purchaser on a property or properties (the "Secured Properties") with an aggregate value (as reasonably agreed between Sellers and Purchaser) of at least FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ($5,000,000) or (ii) deliver to Escrow for release to Purchaser at Closing as cash collateral cash in the amount of FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ($5,000,000) (the "Funds") (either being referred to as the "Security Amount"). Sellers may from time to time substitute the Deeds of Trusts for the Funds or vice versa to satisfy the Security Amount. The priority of the Deeds of Trust, if delivered in lieu of the Funds, shall be evidenced by standard form ALTA title policies in the amount of the Security Amount, issued by the Title Company and paid for by Sellers, insuring that the Deeds of Trust are a first lien on the identified properties, subject to no exceptions that materially affect the use, value or marketability of such property. Following Closing, representatives of Purchaser and Sellers shall meet periodically to determine in good faith whether the Security Amount should be reduced and whether security in this amount is no longer necessary to secure the Agreement Obligations because some of Sellers Agreement Obligations have expired or have been completed and the amount of the remaining Security Amount exceeds the then-estimated amount of Sellers remaining Agreement Obligations, including the receipt of closure letters or no further action letters from any Agency with regard to the environmental conditions at the Sites pursuant to Article 7\. Any such reduction shall be applied first to the Deeds of Trust and the Funds and then to the letter of credit. If the parties cannot mutually agree to a reduction of the Security Amount of the Deeds of Trust, the amount of the Funds or the amount of the letter of credit, then either party may elect to arbitrate such issue. Sellers may from time to time with Purchasers prior written consent, which shall not unreasonably be withheld, substitute alternative security of a value sufficient so that the 

   ##### 

  

 

aggregate value of the Secured Properties is equal to or greater than the
Security Amount. To the extent not already realized on or released and
subject to all pending claims having been resolved and satisfied, Purchaser
shall release any and all liens it may hold on the Secured Properties on the
tenth anniversary of the Closing Date. For any year or portion thereof during
which the letter of credit was outstanding, Purchaser shall pay the Sellers
jointly, on or before January 31 of the following year, an amount equal to
the out-of-pocket charges paid by Sellers for the issuance and/or maintenance
of the letter of credit during the previous calendar year, but not to exceed
an amount calculated at an annual rate of 1% of the average amount of the
letter of credit outstanding during the previous calendar year. 

   

 3.4.2 Sellers Conditions. Closing shall not occur unless and until the following conditions precedent and contingencies have been satisfied or waived in writing by Sellers in Sellers sole and absolute discretion:

 3.4.2.5 There shall not be in effect any order from a court or governmental authority having jurisdiction over the parties or the Assets barring the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement nor any litigation or proceeding by any federal or state governmental agency to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and 

  

 3.4.2.6 On the Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay Sellers the Purchase Price Balance.

rights or remedies it may have, whether in law or in equity, to obtain an
injunction enjoining and restraining each of the Sellers, Moller or the
Moller Trust from violating or attempting or threatening to violate any
provision of this Agreement, including the covenants contained in this

 7.2 Establishment of Baseline Condition. The Baseline Condition at each Site shall be established as set forth in this Section 7.2. 

  

 7.2.1 Assessed Sites. An "Assessed Site" is a Site where Sellers have environmental reports or data from January 1, 2004 or later that provide sufficient information to establish the Baseline Condition for the Site. A newly-constructed Site completed after January 1, 2004 shall also constitute an "Assessed Site." 

   

 7.2.1.1 Within 21 days of the Effective Date, Sellers shall provide Purchaser with a list of Assessed Sites and access to and the right to make copies of all environmental reports and data Sellers intend to rely on to establish the Baseline Condition for each Assessed Site. Within 21 days of Purchasers receipt of this information, Sellers and Purchaser shall meet to determine the Baseline Condition for each Assessed Site. Should the parties reasonably dispute whether such information exists to adequately characterize an Assessed Site, the parties shall attempt to resolve any disagreement consistent with the terms of Section 7.4.2. To the extent additional work is required to adequately characterize an Assessed Site, the Assessed Site shall be considered an Unassessed Site and the parties shall proceed with such work as set forth in Section 7.2.2 below. Any Site assessed from January 1, 2004 or later using the protocol of Section 7.2.2.1 shall be deemed an Assessed Site. 

  

 7.2.2 Unassessed Sites. An "Unassessed Site" is a Site where Sellers do not have environmental reports or data from January 1, 2004 or later that provide sufficient information to establish the Baseline Condition for the Site. 

   

 7.2.2.1 Within 21 days of the Effective Date, Sellers shall provide Purchaser with a list of Unassessed Sites. Within 60 days of the meeting provided for in Section 7.2.1.1, unless the parties otherwise agree that no assessment is needed as to any Unassessed Site, Sellers shall cause an independent, qualified and properly licensed environmental consulting firm reasonably acceptable to Purchaser (the "Environmental Consultant") to conduct and complete environmental site assessments of Environmental Conditions at each Unassessed Site in accordance with the protocol set forth in _Schedule 7.2.2.1 _(the "Environmental Protocol"), prepared under a Site-specific workplan reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers consistent with the Environmental Protocol (each an "Environmental Site Assessment"), and prepare environmental reports for the benefit of Sellers and Purchaser setting forth the results of the Environmental Site Assessment. Such Site-specific workplan shall not unreasonably disrupt operations at the Site in question. All costs and expenses related to the Environmental Site Assessments and the preparation of the environmental reports and/or data shall be borne by Sellers. Sellers and Purchaser shall have equal access to all information developed by the Environmental Consultant and shall each receive two copies of all environmental reports and/or data. All environmental reports and/or data shall be completed and provided to Purchaser at least 14 days prior to the Closing Date. The environmental reports and/or data may be relied on by both Sellers and Purchaser. Purchaser and Sellers shall have 14 days following receipt of all environmental reports and/or data to review the environmental reports and/or data. Should Purchaser and/or Sellers contest or question any findings in any environmental report and/or data, they shall notify the other in writing of such concern(s) with three (3) days of receipt of all environmental reports and/or 

   ##### 

  

    

data. If the parties are unable to resolve the concerns, they shall attempt to
resolve any disagreement consistent with the terms of Section 7.4.2. The
Baseline Condition for an Unassessed Site shall be the concentration(s) of
Hazardous Materials as documented in the environmental report and/or data
prepared pursuant to this Section 7.2.2.1 or as otherwise established
following dispute resolution except that the Baseline Condition for an
Assessed Site which became an Unassessed Site because additional work was
needed to adequately characterize the Site shall be the concentration of
Hazardous Materials as documented in the environmental report and/or
data prepared pursuant to this Section 7.2.2.1 and the concentration of
Hazardous Materials as documented in the environmental report(s) and/or data
provided pursuant to Section 7.2.1.1. 

  

 7.2.3 Notwithstanding anything provided for in Section 7.2, the Baseline Condition for each Site shall include the presence in any amount of the oxygenates methyl tertiary butyl ether ("MTBE"), tertiary butyl alcohol ("TBA"), diisopropyl ether ("DIPE"), ethyl tertiary butyl ether ("ETBE"), and tertiary-amyl methyl ether ("TAME") (including degradation products of these oxygenates) at, under, upon or migrating to or from any of the Site regardless of whether the presence of such oxygenates is suspected, known, discovered or confirmed prior to or after the Closing Date; provided, however, to the extent any of these oxygenates are used in any fuel product sold by Purchaser or its successors at any of the Sites after the Closing, this Section 7.2.3 shall not be applicable to automatically establish the Baseline Condition for any such Site or automatically allocate responsibility for the Site between the Parties. This Section 7.2.3 shall not affect Sellers obligations under this Agreement with respect to any such oxygenates or their degradation products which are included in any report and/or data used to establish a Baseline Condition. 

   

 7.3 Corrective Actions. If any Site presently has any Environmental Conditions or if the work undertaken to establish the Baseline Condition for a Site reveals any Environmental Conditions, Sellers shall retain an independent, qualified and properly licensed environmental consulting firm (which may but need not be the Environmental Consultant) and, if necessary, an engineer and environmental contractor (collectively, the "Remediation Consultant") to develop and implement the Remediation and Sellers shall remain responsible for all Corrective Action, subject to each of the following: 

  

 7.3.1 All Corrective Action shall be at the expense of Sellers. 

   

 7.3.2 At Purchasers expense, Purchaser shall have the right to have its Remediation Consultant(s) present during Sellers Corrective Action at a Site. 

   

 7.3.3 All Corrective Action shall be taken in a prompt and diligent fashion, subject to Sellers obligation to take reasonable steps to minimize adverse impacts to Purchasers operation of the Assets. 

   

 7.3.4 Sellers shall be entitled to reasonable access to the Sites in order to effect the Corrective Action without any access fee or similar expense being imposed by Purchaser on Seller. 

    ##### 

  

  

 7.3.5 Sellers shall keep Purchaser informed of the progress of the Corrective Actions, by providing Purchaser electronic copies of all reports submitted to the Agency while performing Corrective Actions. 

   

 7.3.5 Sellers shall effect Remediation to the levels required by the Agency, using any approved methodology (including risk-based closure). When such Remediation is complete as to a Site under the standards allowed by the Agency (provided Sellers do not cause a restriction to the deed or other notation to title without the express written consent of Purchaser), Sellers shall submit a written report to the Agency seeking site closure (the "Closure Report"). Sellers Corrective Actions as to the Site in question shall be deemed complete, and Sellers Corrective Actions with regard to such Site shall be discharged the date (the "Site Completion Date") that is the earlier of (i) Sellers receipt of written approval of the Closure Report by the Agency, or (ii) Sellers receipt of a "no further action letter" from the Agency related to said Closure Report. 

   

 7.3.6 Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.3, Purchaser is responsible to address Environmental Conditions arising prior to December 12, 2002 at the Tesoro Sites that require Corrective Action. 

   

 7.4 Integrity Assurance Records. During the course of Sellers performance of Corrective Action at each Site, Purchaser shall maintain inventory and tank and line inspection, maintenance and repair records for such Site as required to comply with any and all Environmental Laws. Sellers shall have the right to review these records as Sellers deem necessary so as to be assured of the integrity of Purchasers tank and line system at the Site. 

  

 7.4.1 Allocation of Responsibility. The parties acknowledge that the criteria for allocation of Environmental Conditions between the parties, whether for settlement or by arbitration, shall be as follows: 

   

 Sellers shall have responsibility for any Environmental Conditions other than those resulting from any Reportable Release by Purchaser or for any of the obligations under Section 7.3.6 ("Sellers Environmental Conditions"). Purchaser shall have responsibility for any Environmental Condition resulting from a Reportable Release by Purchaser and for any of the obligations under Section 7.3.6 ("Purchasers Environmental Conditions"). If the evidence establishes that Sellers Environmental Conditions and Purchasers Environmental Conditions have co-mingled then (i) other than with regard to the Tesoro Sites, Purchasers responsibility for Environmental Conditions shall be limited only to any additional costs greater than what Sellers would have incurred in responding to and remediating Sellers then existing Environmental Conditions or (ii) with regard to the Tesoro Sites, Sellers responsibility for Environmental Conditions shall be limited only to any additional costs greater than what Purchaser would have incurred in responding to then existing Environmental Conditions. 

  

 7.4.2 Dispute Resolution. Attempts to resolve disputes as to establishing Baseline Condition at any Site as set forth in Section 7.2, allocation of Environmental Condition responsibility as set forth in Section 7.4.1, and costs estimates as set forth in Section 7.6.2 shall proceed in the following order. 

    ##### 

  

  

 7.4.2.1 _Cooperative Resolution._  

  

 The parties shall first attempt to resolve any disputes through cooperative resolution. The parties shall exchange the following information: 

  

 (i) Inventory reconciliation records. 

  

 (ii) Underground Tank System, as defined under the California Health and Safety Code, testing results. 

  

 (iii) Operations and maintenance information on the Underground Tank System. 

  

 (iv) Leak detection and monitoring equipment-testing data. 

  

 (v) Operations and maintenance information on the leak detection and monitoring systems. 

  

 (vi) All data collected or generated as a result of either partys environmental investigation, including soil and groundwater samples. 

  

 (vii) All data concerning the volume of any release. 

  

 (viii) All data concerning the presence of oxygenates, including MTBE, degradation products of oxygenates and ethanol. 

  

 (ix) Any unauthorized release reports to the Agency. 

  

 (x) Any "no further action letters" from the Agency. 

  

 Such exchange of evidence shall be completed within 45 days of the demand by Purchaser and Sellers delivering one (1) complete set of copies to the other, along with a certification signed by an officer of such party certifying the delivered documents are complete or noticing the reasons why requesting documents were not delivered. The parties shall not be obligated to exchange their independent analysis, conclusions or recommendations prepared internally or by consultants with a view towards use in arbitration. 

  

 The parties may thereafter, within a reasonable amount of time, agree to meet and attempt in good faith to settle the allocation of responsibility for the Sites Environmental Conditions. All efforts pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be confidential settlement discussions and shall not be admitted in any subsequent proceedings, arbitration or other action. If no resolution is reached, either party may in writing notify the other of its election to arbitrate the disputed issues pursuant to Article 27, except as such procedure may be modified by Section 7.4.2.2 

   ##### 

  

  

 7.4.2.2 _Arbitration._  

  

 7.5.4.2.1 If the parties are not able to resolve a dispute under Article 7 pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then either party may make a demand for arbitration in writing. 

  

 7.5.4.2.2 The selection of an arbitrator shall be subject to Article 27, except the parties shall attempt to mutually select or cause to be appointed an arbitrator from JAMS who is sufficiently experienced in arbitrating disputes concerning soil and groundwater contamination. If, after appointment of the arbitrator and after an initial conference with the arbitrator and the parties, either party reasonably believes the arbitrator would benefit from the technical advice of a knowledgeable, independent environmental consultant, such party may demand the appointment of such independent environmental consultant to act as a technical consultant for the arbitrator. Thereafter, the parties shall mutually select an independent environmental consultant and, if they are unable, the arbitrator may use its discretion to select a technical consultant. The arbitrator shall decide the scope and use of the technical consultant. The parties shall initially advance the cost of the technical consultant equally. Upon conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator shall award the recovery of the costs of the technical consultant to the party who substantially prevails on the disputed issues. 

  

 7.5 UST Fund. 

  

 7.5.1 California 

   

 7.5.1.1 Sellers and Purchaser have interests in Sites covered under this Agreement for which Sellers are an eligible or potentially eligible claimant under the California Underground Storage Tank Cleanup Fund established by the Barry Keene Underground Storage Tank Cleanup Trust Fund Act of 1989 ("the Fund" or "Fund"). If mutually agreed to in writing after the Closing, Sellers and Purchaser can participate in Corrective Action for any of these Sites, on behalf of whatever company is the Fund eligible claimant at the time. For example, costs of Corrective Action for a Site paid by Purchaser while Sellers are the Claimant for said Site are to be considered paid on behalf of Sellers with any Fund proceeds reimbursed to Purchaser upon Fund reimbursement. 

  

 7.5.1.2 Sellers and Purchaser agree to proceed with Fund assignment and reimbursement as set forth in this Section 7.5.1.2. 

  

 (a) _Sites With Existing UST Cleanup Fund Claims:_ _Exhibit Z_ lists and provides claim numbers for all Sites covered under this Agreement for which Sellers have approved claims for reimbursement ("Existing Claim(s)") from the Fund. Sellers and Purchaser agree that Sellers will continue to conduct Corrective Action at the Sites listed on _Exhibit Z_ at Sellers own expense and will continue to own rights to the Existing Claim(s) and will, at Sellers own expense, administer and pursue reimbursement under the Existing Claim(s). If Sellers and Purchaser agree in writing that Purchaser shall assume Corrective Action at a Site listed on  _Exhibit Z,_ or if an Agency shall require Purchaser to assume Corrective Action at a Site listed on _Exhibit Z,_ Sellers will assign Sellers reimbursement rights (excluding the right to receive reimbursement from Tesoro for any Seller incurred expenses which are reimbursed from 

   ##### 

  

    

the Fund) for any or all of the Existing Claim(s) for such Site ("Assignment
for Existing Claims") subject to the approval of the Fund and in accordance
with Section 7.5.1.3. To exercise its Assignment for Existing Claims option,
Sellers and Purchaser shall notify the Fund in writing of its desire to
immediately be assigned the Existing Claim(s) and provide a copy of the
relevant portions of the Agreement, with intent to keep such portions of the
Agreement held Business Confidential by the Fund. The Assignment of any
Existing Claim(s) shall become effective upon issue of written approval by
the Fund that the associated Letter of Commitment(s) has been reassigned per
Purchasers request. Purchaser agrees to notify Sellers in advance of
exercising the Assignment of Existing Claims option and copy Sellers on all
relevant correspondence with the Fund. 

  

 (b) _Sites Pending UST Cleanup Fund Claim Approval:_ _Exhibit Z_ lists all Sites in California covered under this Agreement for which Sellers have applied for reimbursement from the Fund but have not received approval for reimbursement from the Fund ("Pending Claim(s)"). Sellers and Purchaser agree that Sellers will continue to conduct Corrective Action at the Sites listed on _Exhibit Z_ at Sellers own expense and will continue to own rights to the Pending Claim(s) and will, at Sellers own expense, administer and pursue reimbursement under the Pending Claim(s). If Sellers and Purchaser agree in writing that Purchaser shall assume Corrective Action at a Site listed on _Exhibit Z,_ or if an Agency shall require Purchaser to assume Corrective Action at a Site listed on _Exhibit Z,_ Sellers will assign Sellers reimbursement rights (excluding the right to receive reimbursement from Tesoro for any Seller incurred expenses which are reimbursed from the Fund) for any or all of the Pending Claim(s) for such Site ("Assignment of Pending Claims") subject to the approval of the Fund and in accordance with Section 7.5.1.3. To exercise the Assignment of Pending Claims option, Sellers and Purchaser shall notify the Fund in writing of its desire to immediately be assigned the Pending Claim(s) and provide a copy of the relevant portions of the Agreement, with intent to keep such portions of the Agreement held Business Confidential by the Fund. The Assignment of any Pending Claim(s) shall become effective upon issue of written approval by the Fund that the associated Letter of Commitment(s) has been assigned per Purchasers request. Purchaser agrees to notify Sellers in advance of exercising the Assignment of Pending Claims option and copy Sellers on all relevant correspondence with the Fund. 

  

 (c) _Sites With Future UST Cleanup Fund Claims:_ _Exhibit Z_ lists all Sites in California covered under this Agreement for which Sellers have not applied for reimbursement from the Fund. For Sites listed on _Exhibit Z,_ where a Release, whether known or unknown, occurred prior to the Closing Date for which Sellers have not yet applied for reimbursement from the Fund, Sellers will conduct Corrective Action at the Sites at Sellers own expense and will pursue a claim with the Fund and assume any and all rights to reimbursement of eligible costs from the Fund ("Future Claim Rights"). If Sellers and Purchaser agree in writing that Purchaser shall assume Corrective Action at a Site listed on _Exhibit Z,_ or if an Agency shall require Purchaser to assume Corrective Action at a Site listed on _Exhibit Z,_ as appropriate Seller will pursue Future Claim Rights. To the extent Sellers pursue Future Claim Rights and Purchaser performs the Corrective Action, either because the parties agree or because an Agency requires Purchaser to assume Corrective Action at a Site listed on _Exhibit Z,_ Sellers will assign Sellers reimbursement rights (excluding the right to receive reimbursement from Tesoro for any Seller incurred expenses which are reimbursed from the Fund) for any or all of 

   ##### 

  

    

the Future Claim Rights for such Site ("Assignment of Future Claim Rights")
subject to the approval of the Fund and in accordance with Section 7.5.1.3.
To exercise the Assignment of Future Claim Rights option, Sellers and
Purchaser shall notify the Fund in writing of its desire to immediately be
assigned the Future Claim Rights and provide a copy of the relevant portions
of the Agreement, with intent to keep such portions of the Agreement held
Business Confidential by the Fund. The assignment of any Future Claim Rights
shall become effective upon issue of written approval and that the associated
Letter of Commitment(s) by the Fund has been assigned per Purchasers
request. Purchaser agrees to notify Sellers in advance of exercising the
Assignment of Future Claim Rights option and copy Sellers on all relevant
correspondence with the Fund. 

  

 7.5.1.3 _Assignment Terms:_ Any and all Assignments of Existing Claims, Pending Claims or Future Claim Rights (collectively, "Claim Assignment") to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 7.5 are intended to be in compliance with the terms specified in the Board Order entitled _In the Matter of Petition of Lake Publishing Company,_ Order WQ 2000-06-UST ("the Order"). Consistent with the Order, Sellers will maintain liability for Corrective Action irrespective of Claim Assignment(s). Purchaser covenants prior to performing any remediation to reasonably consider and analyze the estimated cost and expenses of utilizing the proposed remediation method as compared to alternative methods in order to preserve the reimbursement funds available under the Fund. Further consistent with the Order and the Funds most current published guidelines for assignment, the terms of any such Claim Assignment are as set forth in Sections 7.5.1.3(a) and 7.5.1.3(b) wherein the term "Assignor" pertains to Sellers and "Assignee" pertains to Purchaser. 

  

 (a) Assignor agrees to assign the following rights to reimbursement: 

  

       | a.  |   | The Letter of Commitment (LOC);  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | b.  |   | Costs that are incurred by Assignor before the effective
date of the Claim Assignment, but that are not submitted to the Fund for
reimbursement until after the effective date of the Claim Assignment.
Assignee agrees to pay such costs to Assignor to the extent reimbursed;  
      
    | c.  |   | Costs that are incurred by Assignor before the effective
date of the Claim Assignment and that were submitted by the Assignor before

Fund before the effective date of the Claim Assignment. Assignee agrees to
pay such costs to Assignor to the extent reimbursed;  
      
    | d.  |   | Cost incurred by Assignee after the effective date of
the Claim Assignment;  
      
    | e.  |   | For Sites where Assignor has not filed a claim with the
Fund, the rights to submit a claim application to the Fund and to pursue
reimbursement under the claim. Assignee agrees to demonstrate Assignors
eligibility for the Fund and the priority class for which Assignor would
qualify.  
   

  

 (b) Rights to the Assignee to Receive Reimbursement After the Effective Date of the Assignment. 

   ##### 

  

  

       | a.  |   | Assignee acknowledges and agrees that the maximum
amount allowed for reimbursement is established by the Barry Keene
Underground Storage Tank Cleanup Trust Fund Act of 1989.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | b.  |   | Assignee acknowledges and agrees that any reimbursement
paid prior to the effective date to the Assignor will reduce the amount
available per occurrence.  
      
    | c.  |   | Assignee acknowledges that should there be an
overpayment surrounding past costs reimbursed to the Assignor, reimbursement
due the Assignee will be reduced by the amount of the overpayment owed by the
Assignor.  
      
    | d.  |   | Assignee acknowledges that should there be any
outstanding issues surrounding past costs reimbursed to the Assignor, such as
proof of payment, reimbursement due the Assignee will be reduced by the

    | e.  |   | When requested by the Fund, Assignee agrees to complete
and execute the Non-Recovery from Other Sources Disclosure Certification
("Certification") for any funds received by the Assignor or the Assignee.
Assignee will be required to obtain such information from the Assignor in
order to properly complete the Certification.  
      
    | f.  |   | Assignee acknowledges that if Assignor or Assignee has
received funds from a third party source for costs that would otherwise be
eligible for Fund reimbursement or receives money after the effective date of
the Claim Assignment for such costs, reimbursement due Assignee will be
reduced by the amount received by Assignor and/or Assignee.  
      
    | g.  |   | As appropriate, Assignee shall comply with all
applicable laws, regulations, terms contained in the Letter of Commitment and
any other requirements that are a condition of payment for reimbursement from
the Fund.  
   

  

 7.5.2 States Other Than California. Sellers and Purchaser have interests in non-California Sites covered under this Agreement for which Sellers are an eligible or potentially eligible claimant under applicable underground storage tank fund reimbursement laws. Sellers and Purchaser agree that Sellers, at Sellers own expense, are responsible and liable for any Corrective Action at these Sites for Releases, whether known or unknown, that occurred prior to the Closing Date. At Sellers own expense, Sellers will administer and pursue reimbursement for such Corrective Action work under applicable underground storage tank fund reimbursement laws. Sellers and Purchaser further agree that as of the Closing Date, Purchaser has the option to assume Corrective Action at Sites covered by this Section 7.5.2 to the extent allowed by the applicable law. If Purchaser assumes Corrective Action at a Site covered under this Section 7.5.2, Sellers will take all appropriate action necessary to ensure Purchaser obtains Sellers reimbursement rights subject to the requirements of the applicable underground storage tank fund reimbursement laws and to the extent allowed by applicable law. Sellers and Purchaser may participate in Corrective Action for any of these Sites, as the eligible underground storage tank fund claimant. For example, costs of Corrective Action for a Site paid by Purchaser while Sellers are the Claimant for said Site are to be considered paid on behalf of Sellers with any proceeds reimbursed to Purchaser upon reimbursement. 

    ##### 

  

  

 7.6 Terminal. 

  

 7.6.1 Terminal EH and S Audit. Within 30 days of the Effective Date, Purchaser shall have the right at Purchasers sole expense to conduct and/or engage environmental consultants to conduct an environmental, health and safety audit of the Terminal in accordance with applicable Environmental Laws and ASTM or other Standards, as agreed upon in writing by the parties (the "Terminal EHandS Audit"). Such Terminal EHandS Audit shall include an estimate of the costs to correct or address any non-compliance identified in the course of the audit (the "Estimated Terminal Liabilities"). Any fines and penalties payable as a result of conditions or practices identified in the Terminal EHandS Audit shall be the sole responsibility of and shall be promptly paid in full by the Sellers, and shall not constitute Estimated Terminal Liabilities or Actual Terminal Liabilities for purposes of this Agreement. The Terminal EHandS Audit shall be completed at least 60 days prior to the Closing Date and Purchaser and Seller shall concurrently receive a copy of the EHandS Audit. Following Sellers receipt of the Terminal EHandS Audit, the parties agree to meet and confer to review the Terminal EHandS Audit results. 

   

 7.6.2 Terminal Baseline Condition. The Baseline Condition for the Terminal shall be established pursuant to Section 7.2. If Corrective Action is required at the Terminal, costs for such Corrective Action shall be quantified by the Environmental Consultant retained pursuant to Section 7.2 and provided to both parties at least 60 days prior to the Closing Date. Should the parties dispute the Environmental Consultants cost estimate for such Corrective Action, they shall attempt to resolve any disagreement consistent with the terms of Section 7.4.2. 

   

 7.6.3 To the extent the sum of the actual costs (i) to correct or address any non-compliance identified in the course of the Terminal EHandS Audit and (ii) to address Corrective Action for the Terminal (collectively, the "Actual Terminal Audit and Baseline Costs") is equal to or less than $250,000, Purchaser shall bear such costs. To the extent Actual Terminal Audit and Baseline Costs exceed $250,000, the Sellers shall bear such costs in excess of $250,000. 

   

 7.6.4 If the sum of (i) Estimated Terminal Liabilities and (ii) the costs to address Corrective Action for the Terminal as established by the Environmental Consultant or following the dispute resolution procedures exceeds $500,000, either Purchaser or the Sellers may elect to remove the Terminal from the Assets sold under this Agreement, with a reduction in the Purchase Price of $5,000,000, and Section 7.6.3 shall not apply. 

   

 7.7 Sellers Indemnity. Sellers shall defend, protect (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser), indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, its parent, subsidiaries and Affiliates and their respective officers, employees, attorneys, business invitees, guests, customers, contractors and agents from and against all claims, damages (excluding exemplary or punitive damages and damages for lost profits), losses, costs (including Remediation Costs), expenses and liabilities, to include property damage and personal injury (including death) (and including, but not limited to, all attorneys fees, fines, penalties, and court costs and expert witness fees and costs) which arise out of or are in any way connected with (a) the presence of Hazardous Materials which first became situated on, under or about each Site before the Closing 

   ##### 

  

    

Date, (b) any violation of Environmental Laws applicable to each Site which
results from Hazardous Materials located on such Site before the Closing
Date, or (c) any violation of any Environmental Laws relating to the
operation of the Sites prior to the Closing Date (each, a
"Purchaser Indemnity Claim"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers duty to
defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless as set forth in the proceeding
sentence for Tesoro Sites shall be limited to the time period from December
11, 2002 through the Closing Date. Except for third-party claims related to
gasoline additives or gasoline oxygenates listed in Section 7.2.3 for which
there shall be no Indemnity Cutoff Date as defined below, Sellers Indemnity
under this Article 7 as to each Site shall be limited to the lesser period of
either (i) ten (10) years from the Closing Date or (ii) five (5) years after
the Site Completion Date (the greater period being the "Indemnity
Cutoff Date"); unless prior to the Indemnity Cutoff Date, (i) Purchaser
notifies Seller of a Purchaser Indemnity Claim, or (ii) Seller is actively
indemnifying Purchaser for a Purchaser Indemnity Claim. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 7.7, Sellers obligation to perform
Corrective Action at any Site shall be discharged in accordance with Section
7.3. The obligations of Sellers under this Section 7.7 are in addition to the
obligations of Sellers under the other provisions of this Article 7. 

  

 7.8 Purchasers Indemnity. Purchaser shall defend, protect (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Sellers), indemnify and hold harmless Sellers, their its parent, subsidiaries and Affiliates and their respective officers, employees, attorneys, business invitees, guests, customers, contractors and agents from and against all claims, damages (excluding exemplary or punitive damages and damages for lost profits), losses, costs, expenses and liabilities, to include property damage and personal injury (including death) (and including, but not limited to, all attorneys fees, fines, penalties, and court costs and expert witness fees and costs) which arise out of or are in any way connected with (i) the presence of Hazardous Materials which first become situated on, under or about each Site after the Closing Date, or (ii) any violation of Environmental Laws applicable to each Site which results from Hazardous Materials that first come to be located on the Site after the Closing Date. The obligations of Purchaser under this Section 7.8 are in addition to the obligations of Purchaser under the other provisions of this Article 7. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Article 7, including Section 7.8, shall negate Purchasers obligations, including indemnity, under the Sale and Purchase Agreement and Joint Escrow Instructions for Tesoro Northern California Marketing Assets entered into as of October 31, 2002 between Tesoro Refining and Marketing Company and USA Petroleum Corporation. 

  

 7.9 Survival. This Article 7 shall survive the Closing Date. Each party shall bind its successors and assigns and any tenants, operators or licensees to the terms and conditions in this Article 7. 

  

ARTICLE 8 

   

TITLE MATTERS  

  

 8.1 Title Commitments and Permitted Exceptions. 

  

 8.1.1 Sellers shall use its good faith, diligent efforts to cause First American Title Insurance Company (the "Title Company") to issue a title commitment for each Site, 

    ##### 

  

 

together with legible copies of all documents referred to therein ("PTR")
within 15 days after the Effective Date. In addition, Sellers shall use its
good faith, diligent efforts to deliver to Purchaser an ALTA survey for each
Site ("Survey") within 60 days after the Effective Date. 

   

 8.1.2 On or before thirty (30) days after the date of delivery of each PTR, Purchaser shall have the right to notify Sellers and Escrow Holder, in writing (the "Notice"), of all items reflected in each of the PTRs that Purchaser reasonably believes will adversely affect the business operations of the applicable Site for use as a gas station, truck stop or petroleum products terminal, as the case may be, or constitute a lien on such Site for amounts payable which are not subject to proration pursuant to Section 21.3, (each, an "Adverse Title Exception"). Such negative effect on such business operations and/or lien is herein referred to as the "Title Value Impact." Purchasers Notice shall include reasonably detailed information and supporting documents concerning the basis of the Title Value Impact. No later than five (5) days after timely delivery of the last Notice of Adverse Title Exception for all of the Sites, Purchaser and Seller will meet and confer (either in person or via telephonic conference) to discuss the Notices and the Adverse Title Exceptions (the "Title Meeting"). 

   

 8.1.2.1 Notwithstanding Section 8.1.2 above, Purchaser shall have no right to raise any Adverse Title Exceptions which existed on or before December 11, 2002 on any of the Tesoro Sites (as defined in Section 7.1.12) and Sellers shall have no obligation to cure or remedy any such Adverse Title Exceptions on those Sites. As to any such Adverse Title Exceptions existing on those Sites as of December 11, 2002, Purchaser shall be accepting such Adverse Title Exceptions in an "as is" condition. 

  

 8.1.3 Purchaser agrees to bear the burden of any Title Value Impact of all Adverse Title Exceptions applicable to a single Site, by either (at Purchasers election) (i) accepting such Site without remedying such Adverse Title Exceptions and/or (ii) bearing the cost of remedying such Adverse Title Exceptions, up to $30,000 per Site, and the Sellers agree to bear the burden of any Title Value Impact of all Adverse Title Exceptions applicable to a single Site which is in excess of such initial $30,000, by either (at Sellers election) (i) accepting a dollar-for-dollar adjustment to the Purchase Price at Closing, and/or (ii) bearing the cost of remedying such Adverse Title Exceptions, up to $30,000 per Site in excess of Purchasers $30,000. Either Party may remedy any Adverse Title Exception(s) by causing the Title Company to remove or delete the Adverse Title Exception(s) from the PTR or by endorsement or otherwise causing the Title Company to insure the Adverse Title Exception(s). All of Sellers and Purchasers above elections are subject in each case to the following limitations: 

  

 8.1.3.1 If the aggregate Title Value Impact of all Adverse Title Exceptions applicable to a  _single_ Site exceeds $60,000, then either Purchaser or Sellers may, at their sole discretion, within five (5) days of the Title Meeting, by written notice to the other Party, elect to delete such Site from the Assets, and the Purchase Price will be adjusted to remove the fair market value (to be established as set forth in Section 8.1.4) that such Site would have if there were no Adverse Title Exceptions applicable to such Site (the "Fair Market Value" of such Site). Upon deletion of any Site pursuant to this Section 8.1.3.1 or Section 8.1.3.2 below, neither Party will have any obligation to the other Party concerning such Site and the Site shall be treated as if it was never included as an Asset to this Agreement. 

    ##### 

 

   

 8.1.3.2 In addition to the rights under Section 8.1.3.1 above, if the _aggregate_  burden that would be borne by either Purchaser, on the one hand, or all of the Sellers, on the other hand, pursuant to Section 8.1.3 for all Sites exceeds $600,000, the Party that would otherwise bear such excess burden shall have the right, at their sole discretion, within five (5) days of the Title Meeting, by written notice to the other Party, to select one Site to be deleted which is affected by the Adverse Title Exceptions. If after such first deletion there still remains an aggregate burden in excess of $600,000, then the Parties will take turns in selecting the next Site to be deleted, starting with the Party that did not select the first Site to be deleted, until such burden has been reduced to or below $600,000 (unless the parties agree to another method of selecting the Site(s) to be deleted), and the Purchase Price will be adjusted to remove the Fair Market Value of such deleted Site(s). 

  

 8.1.4 The Parties will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to agree on the Title Value Impact of the Adverse Title Exceptions applicable to any single Site and, if a Site is deleted pursuant to this Section 8.1, to agree on its Fair Market Value. The Parties hereby agree that the Terminal has a Fair Market Value of $5,000,000. If the parties cannot agree on such Title Value Impact or Fair Market Value of any Site, then for Closing purposes only, the Parties agree to establish a tentative Title Value Impact and Fair Market Value. Unless the parties otherwise agree, the tentative Fair Market Value of a deleted Site will be $1,800,000. Notwithstanding the tentative determination to allow Closing to proceed without delay on account of the disagreement, either Purchaser or Sellers may refer the dispute for binding determination by a single appraiser experienced in the valuation of petroleum retail facilities mutually agreed by the Parties or, if they are unable to agree on such appraiser, such an appraiser appointed by the presiding officer of the Los Angeles office of JAMS/Endispute. If the appraiser determines different Title Value Impact and Fair Market Value of each Site than what the Parties had tentatively established for the Title Value Impact and Fair Market Value, the appropriate party shall promptly pay the other party the corresponding adjustment amount. No determination by the appraiser shall change the inclusion or deletion of any Site unless the parties otherwise agree. 

  

 8.1.5 Any deeds of trust or mortgages recorded against or securing the Assets, and all prepayment fees or expenses owed to the beneficiaries thereof, shall be paid in full by Sellers prior to or concurrently with the Closing and all other monetary Liens shall be removed by Sellers prior to or at the Closing. 

  

 8.2 Owner or Leasehold Policies of Title Insurance. At the Closing, Sellers shall cause Title Company to issue, as to each of the Sites, an ALTA extended coverage owners policy of title insurance (the "Title Policy") in the amount of the portion of the Purchase Price allocated to the Site as agreed upon by the parties insuring Purchaser that, as of the date of the Closing, Purchaser is vested with fee simple title (as to Fee Sites) or a leasehold estate under the applicable Lease (as to Leased Sites) subject only to installments of real property taxes and other governmental assessments not delinquent and to the Permitted Exceptions. Sellers shall pay 80%, and Purchaser shall pay 20%, of the Title Policy premium for ALTA extended coverage, including any curative endorsements. If Purchaser desires noncurative endorsement(s) beyond ALTA extended coverage, Purchaser shall pay 100% of the incremental cost of such endorsement(s). 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE 9 

   

RISK OF LOSS  

  

 9.1 Casualty or Condemnation. 

  

 9.1.1 In the event that, prior to the Closing Date, all or any portion of any Site is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty (a "Casualty") or taken by condemnation or eminent domain or by agreement in lieu thereof with any person or entity authorized to exercise such rights (a "Taking"), Sellers shall promptly notify Purchaser thereof. 

  

 9.1.2 If, in the good faith estimation of Purchaser, a Casualty will cost more than ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($100,000) to repair, or cannot be repaired within thirty days following the occurrence of the damage Purchaser may, at its option, (a) if Purchaser reasonably believes that reconstruction and/or repair will require 12 or more months to complete, elect to delete the Site subject to such casualty from the Assets, or (b) elect to proceed with the Closing and have all insurance proceeds payable by reason of such damage or destruction assigned to and paid to Purchaser or (c) elect to proceed with the Closing and deduct Purchasers reasonable estimate of the cost to repair or the reduction in market value from the Purchase Price and, in such case, Purchaser will have no right to insurance proceeds. In the event of damage or destruction costing less than $100,000 to repair, Sellers shall either effect the full repair of the same prior to the Closing or the Purchase Price applicable to the Site in question shall be reduced by the full amount necessary to effect such repair. If the parties cannot agree on the amount necessary to effect the repair and deduct from the Purchase Price, they shall retain a mutually agreed third party to establish such repair amount, and shall share equally the expense of such third party. The parties agree that the determination by such third party of the amount necessary to effect the repair and the deduction from the Purchase Price shall be deemed final by the parties hereto, however, if the parties are not able to mutually agree upon such third party, such amount and deduction shall be determined by means of the arbitration provisions of Article 27\. Furthermore, if the repair amount is not agreed or established by two (2) days prior to Closing, the sum of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) shall be deducted from the Purchase Price and when such repair amount is determined, either by agreement or by use of a third party, Purchaser shall immediately pay to Sellers the difference, if any, between the repair amount and $100,000. In the event that after Closing, the repair amount is determined to be in excess of $100,000, Sellers shall immediately pay to Purchaser the amount over $100,000. 

  

 9.1.3 In the event a Taking is commenced or threatened against all of a Site, such Site shall be deleted from the Assets. In the event a Taking relates to only a portion of a Site, it shall not be excluded from the Assets, but Purchaser may, at its option (a) deduct from the Purchase Price Purchasers good faith estimate of the loss in value to such Site resulting from such partial Taking, or (b) have all condemnation proceeds payable by reason of such Taking assigned to and paid to Purchaser. 

  

 9.1.4 If a Site, or Sites, is/are deleted from the Assets pursuant to the provisions of this Section 9.1, _Exhibit A_ shall be appropriately amended, all real and personal property, including all Improvements, Appurtenances, Intangible Property, Books and Records and Inventory, associated with such Site(s) shall be Excluded Property of the type described in 

   ##### 

  

 

Section 1.2, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of ONE
MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,800,000) per Site(s). Immediately
after the Closing, the parties shall confer on the actual value of the
deleted Sites and if they are unable to agree, either party can commence
arbitration for determination of said values. For each deleted Site that the
arbitration results in a determination or the parties agree that the value
was greater than $1,800,000, Sellers shall immediately pay Purchaser the
difference between $1,800,000 and the value determined in arbitration. For
each deleted Site that the arbitration results in a determination or
the parties agree that the value was less than $1,800,000, Purchaser shall
immediately pay Sellers the difference between $1,800,000 and the value
determined in arbitration. 

   

 9.2 Risk of Loss. Subject to this Article 9, Sellers shall retain the risk of loss or damage with respect to each of the Assets until title passes, which shall occur at the Closing. 

  

ARTICLE 10 

   

CHANGES IN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  

 

If either Sellers or Purchaser discovers on or before the Closing that any
representation or warranty made by it or the other was or becomes not true
and correct in any material respect, it shall so notify the other in writing.
The representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall be deemed to
be modified by any matter contained in such notice. In the case of any
such change in the representations or warranties by Sellers, (a) if the
cumulative changes so made would adversely affect the fair market value of
the Assets as currently operated by ONE MILLION DOLLARS ($1,000,000) or more,
Purchaser may object thereto by written notice to Sellers within ten
(10) business days after receipt of the notice and (b) if the cumulative
changes so made would adversely affect the fair market value of the Assets as
currently operated by TWENTY-SEVEN MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
($27,700,000) or more, Purchaser and Sellers shall each have the right
to terminate this Agreement. If such objection notice is not given within the
ten business day period, or the cumulative changes do not have such adverse
effect, then such change shall not give rise to any right or remedy. If such
objection notice is timely given and the effect of the cumulative changes on
the operations of any Site or the adverse affect on the fair market value of
the Assets exceeds such $1,000,000 amount, and Sellers determine that they
cannot cure such adverse effect prior to the Closing applicable to the
Site(s) in question by using commercially reasonable efforts, then the
parties shall negotiate in good faith a reduction of the Purchase Price to
fairly reflect the impact of the adverse change on the fair market value of
the Assets. In the event that the parties are unable to agree on a reduction
of the Purchase Price prior to the Closing, then the parties agree that
either party shall have the right to elect either to (i) unless the Site
has been deleted by either party pursuant to subparagraph (ii) below, submit
the matter (that is, the amount that the Purchase Price should be reduced to
reflect the diminution of the value of the Assets) to arbitration under
Article 27 for resolution after the Closing or (ii) delete the Site(s) in
question from the Assets, and the Purchase Price shall be reduced at the
Closing for each such Site in the amount of ONE MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED
THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1,800,000); provided, further, in such event the parties
hereto shall use their best efforts to reach an agreement on the amount that
the Purchase Price should be reduced based on the value of the deleted Site(s)
and if the parties hereto are unable to 

    ##### 

  

 

agree, either party may submit the matter to arbitration pursuant to Article
27 of the Agreement. In this event, if the arbitrator determines that any or
all of the deleted Sites has a value of greater than $1,800,000 per Site,
Sellers shall immediately pay Purchaser the amount of the difference for each
such Site. However, if the arbitrator determines that any or all of the
deleted Sites has a value of less than $1,800,000 per Site, Purchaser shall
immediately pay Sellers the amount of the difference for each such Site (up
to a maximum amount of $1,800,000 per Site). 

   

ARTICLE 11 

   

RECORDS  

  

 11.1 Sellers Rights to Records. Sellers shall retain originals of any records regarding the Assets for which it has any business, technical, tax, environmental or legal need, and Purchaser may make copies of such retained originals from time to time at Purchasers request before or after the Closing. To the extent that those records, or any other information made available to Purchaser before or after the Closing, contain proprietary business or technical information of Sellers or its Affiliates, Purchaser agrees to hold such records in confidence and limit their use to the Assets or as otherwise required by law or as necessary to enforce Purchasers rights under this Agreement. 

  

 11.2 Preservation of Records. Purchaser and Sellers shall not destroy or otherwise dispose of any records acquired or retained hereunder for a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date (except as to tax records, for which the period shall be seven (7) years and except as to environmental records, for which the period shall be ten (10) years) or such longer period as is required by applicable regulations, laws, statutes, or court orders, except upon 30 days prior written notice by the Purchaser or Sellers to the other offering to ship such records to the other at the notifying partys or parties cost and the other partys or parties declining of such offer. During the specified period, Purchaser and Seller shall make such records available to the other or its authorized representatives for any business, legal or technical need in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with the record holders business operations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sellers shall consult and cooperate with Purchaser in preparing the business personal property tax statements (Form 571-1) to be filed by Sellers with respect to the Assets owned during 2007, and provide Purchaser with copies of such statements, together with the workpapers and asset listings relating to such statements. 

  

ARTICLE 12 

   

ACCESS TO ASSETS AFTER CLOSING  

  

 Purchaser shall afford duly authorized representatives of Sellers, and other duly authorized prior owners, reasonable access to the employees and the Sites after the Closing with respect to any legal, technical, environmental or operational matter relating to (a) Sellers obligations under this Agreement, (b) the operation of the Sites before the Closing, and (c) Sellers removal of any Excluded Property from the Sites; provided in each case that Sellers, or the other prior owner, as the case may be, gives Purchaser reasonable prior written notice, and provided further that such access does not unreasonably interfere with Purchasers normal operations. Sellers shall indemnify, defend (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser), 

   ##### 

  

 

protect and hold Purchaser and the Assets harmless from and against any and
all loss, cost, damage, expense or liability arising out of the exercise by
Sellers of the access rights granted in this Article. It is understood and
agreed that Sellers shall remove all Excluded Property from the Sites within
thirty (30) days after Closing. 

   

ARTICLE 13 

   

PURCHASERS INSPECTIONS  

  

 13.1 Access to Assets. From and after the Effective Date, Purchaser shall have the right, personally or through agents, employees, contractors, subcontractors and lenders, at Purchasers expense, to access the Sites and to inspect the same and all records maintained at the Sites, or at Sellers other offices, and to conduct such tests as Purchaser deems reasonably appropriate. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall have the right to inspect the major equipment at the Sites, including, but not limited to, product dispensers, pumps, card readers, air compressors, lifts, convenience store coolers, and air conditioners (collectively, "Major Equipment"). If Purchaser reasonably determines from its inspections that any of the Major Equipment is non-operational, Purchaser shall notify Sellers in writing prior to the Closing Date. Subject to Sellers right to reimbursement under Section 13.2, Sellers, at Sellers option, shall repair or replace such items noted as non-operational with items of equivalent utility, value and quality, at Sellers expense prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 13.2 Post Closing Inspection of Assets. In the event that, following the Closing, Purchaser determines that Major Equipment is missing or previously identified repairs or replacements have not been made pursuant to Section 13.1, and Purchaser delivers written notice of the same to Sellers not later than fourteen (14) days after the Closing, Sellers shall repair or replace such Major Equipment at Sellers sole cost and expense. If Purchaser does not notify Sellers of any Major Equipment missing or repair not made pursuant to Section 13.1 within fourteen (14) days after the Closing in writing, Sellers shall not be obligated to replace or repair any Major Equipment. Purchaser shall reimburse Sellers up to $250,000 in the aggregate for Sellers costs and expenses resulting from Sellers repairs or replacements on Major Equipment for which notice has been given by Purchaser in compliance with Section 13.1 and this Section 13.2. 

  

 13.3 Purchasers Right to Install Equipment on Sites. Purchaser shall have the right, after the Effective Date, personally or through agents, employees, contractors, or subcontractors, to enter the Sites, at Purchasers expense and at such times as are reasonably acceptable to Sellers following request to Sellers, to install telephone lines and other equipment, as needed to effect an orderly transition of operations after the Closing. Purchaser shall not unreasonably interfere with existing operations on the Sites. In the event that the Closing does not occur and Purchaser has installed equipment on any Site in accordance with this Section 13.3, Purchaser shall have the right, at Purchasers option: (a) to remove the equipment installed by Purchaser and restore the Site to its original condition at Purchasers sole cost; or (b) to transfer to Sellers for no consideration, without warranty, express or implied, title to any equipment installed by Purchaser, after which Sellers shall be solely responsible therefor. 

   ##### 

  

  

 13.4 Purchasers Entry Shall be at Purchasers Sole Risk. Each entry by Purchaser or its representatives onto the Sites shall be at Purchasers sole risk, and Purchaser shall indemnify, defend, protect (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Sellers) and hold Sellers and its Affiliates harmless from property damage or personal injury arising out of the exercise by Purchaser of the access rights granted in this Article 13. 

  

 13.5 NO RELIANCE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, PURCHASER AGREES THAT IT CANNOT AND WILL NOT RELY ON ANY STATEMENT MADE DURING ITS ACTIVITIES CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE UNLESS SUCH STATEMENT IS MADE BY AN OFFICER OF A SELLER OR IS REDUCED TO WRITING AND INCORPORATED IN THIS AGREEMENT BY AMENDMENT. 

  

ARTICLE 14 

   

COVENANTS  

  

 14.1 General. Except as contemplated in, or provided for by this Agreement or as required by any applicable law, from the Effective Date until the Closing, Sellers agrees and covenants that (a) the business operations of the Assets shall be conducted only in the ordinary course of business, consistent with its past practice, including the performance of routine repairs and maintenance in accordance with normal schedules and sound management practice, and (b) without limiting the foregoing, Sellers shall not (i) sell, mortgage, or otherwise transfer or convey any portion of the Assets other than the sale of Inventory in the ordinary course of business consistent with previous practice, (ii) except in the ordinary course and consistent with past practice in the conduct of the business operations of the Assets, amend, modify, terminate or suspend any of such operations (except in immaterial respects); (iii) except in the ordinary course and consistent with its past practice in the conduct of such operations, waive or relinquish any right (except in immaterial respects) under any Lease, Contract, Permit or applicable law, (iv) enter into any material service, management or other contract relating to the Assets outside the ordinary course of business, which will survive the Closing without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, (v) permit or suffer to exist any encumbrance, charge or lien to be placed or claimed upon or against the Assets unless such encumbrance, charge or lien has been previously approved in writing by Purchaser or unless such monetary encumbrance, charge or lien will be removed by Sellers prior to the Closing, (vi) hire any employees to work on operations of the Sites outside of hires in the ordinary course of business, (vii) amend in any material respect, when taken as a whole, any Lease or Contract or any other material contract or agreement related to the Assets or the operations of the Sites or terminate any Lease or Contract or any other material contract or agreement before the expiration of the term thereof, other than to the extent any such Contract or material contract or agreement terminates or is terminable pursuant to its terms in the ordinary course of business, or (viii) enter into any Lease or Contract or any other material contract related to the Assets or the operations of the Sites that will survive the Closing. 

  

 14.2 Operation Pending Closing. With respect to the Assets, between the Effective Date and the Closing Date, Sellers shall not permanently close any of the service stations on the Sites, without Purchasers previous written approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers 

   ##### 

  

 

may close any service station temporarily to repair or rebuild the
improvements therein. Sellers covenant to use reasonable commercial efforts
to maintain the current operations on, and the repair and maintenance of, the
Sites between the Effective Date and the Closing; provided, moreover, Sellers
covenants to continue to utilize its same pricing structures to remain
similarly competitive in the respective marketplaces. Sellers shall operate
the Assets and conduct the Sellers operation of business at and from the
Assets without violating in any material respect, any judgments, orders,
injunctions, statutes, rules, regulations or other legal
requirements applicable to, or required in connection with, the Assets,
including the Petroleum Marketing and Practices Act, 15 U.S.C.A. sec. 2801 et
seq., the California Franchise Investment Law, California Corporations Code
sec. 31000 et seq. and the California Business and Professions Code Division
8, Chapters 5.5 (Franchise Relations Act), 7.5 (Franchises) and 7.8
(Franchise Dealers Fair Practices). 

   

 14.3 No Further Marketing of Assets. From and after the Effective Date, and for so long as this Agreement is in effect, Sellers shall not (i) market the Assets to any third party, (ii) facilitate and/or cooperate with any due diligence of the Assets by any third party or (iii) engage in any negotiations for the sale of the Assets to any third party. 

  

 14.4 Pre-Merger Notification. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is subject to the pre-merger notification requirements of Section 7A of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. § 18a) as enacted by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "Hart-Scott-Rodino Act"). Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate and promptly undertake all filings and other actions as may reasonably be required to comply with such requirements. Both parties shall use their best efforts to assure that such filings are made no later than 30 days after the execution of this Agreement. The Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate in responding to any requests for information from any federal or state agency reviewing the transaction and shall cooperate with respect to meetings with any agency. Purchaser and Sellers shall notify each other orally or in writing of agency meetings with respect to the transaction as well as the topics to be discussed at such meeting as promptly as practical after the scheduling of such meeting, and for agency meetings which both Purchaser and Sellers are invited to attend, the parties will cooperate with respect to such meeting. Neither Party shall attend any meetings with an agency without a representative of the other Party unless the agency requests such a private meeting. Purchaser shall pay all Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing fees for the Parties. Purchaser and Sellers (subject to reimbursement as set forth below) shall each pay all of their respective legal and consultant expenses relating to federal or state agency review of the transaction, including communications with the staff and attendance at hearings and related matters, provided that Purchaser will reimburse Sellers for up to ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($100,000) of Sellers reasonable out-of-pocket expense for fees and expenses of Sellers outside counsel and outside consultants provided that such counsel and/or consultants have been approved by Purchaser. Without limitation on the generality of Article 3, Purchaser may either terminate this Agreement or elect to contest such litigation, upon written notice to Sellers, if the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Office of the Attorney General of any State authorizes the filing of a suit to challenge the transactions contemplated hereby. If litigation is initiated by any government agency, and Purchaser elects to contest such litigation, then Purchaser shall assume all responsibility for contesting such litigation and shall pay all legal fees and expert costs incurred in such litigation 

   ##### 

  

 

by either party; provided that Purchaser shall take the lead in such
litigation and Sellers shall cooperate fully with Purchasers defense of any
such litigation. In the event that the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission makes a request, authorized by
Section 7A(e) of the Clayton Act, for additional information or documentary
materials from either or both of the parties hereto, commonly referred to as
a "second request" (a "Second Request"), Purchaser may elect, by giving
written notice to Sellers within twenty (20) days after receipt of such
request, to terminate this Agreement or extend the Termination Date (as
defined in Section 19.1) to October 1, 2007. (Purchaser may also elect to do
neither.) If Purchaser does not elect to terminate the Agreement, the Earnest
Money Deposit shall not be refunded upon any subsequent termination of this
Agreement for any reason whatsoever other than any termination proximately
caused by Sellers breach hereof (in which case it shall be refunded).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, if the Closing occurs, the
Earnest Money Deposit shall be creditable against the Purchase Price.

Thereafter, Purchaser shall have the right to audit the Sites subject to the construction projects or any documentation related to such construction projects. Sellers will proceed with or halt such construction projects in a reasonable manner and in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. If the Closing is completed, Purchaser will reimburse Sellers for 110% of the costs associated with such construction projects between the Effective Date and the Closing (the "Construction Costs") as promptly as practicable after post-Closing receipt of a statement of the Construction Costs from Sellers and supporting evidence of such Construction Costs reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. The payment of the Construction Costs by Purchaser will be deemed to be an adjustment to the Purchase Price. 

  

 14.7 Ethanol Purchase. Sellers or Affiliates of Sellers or successors of either currently have an ethanol plant under construction in or near Pixley, California. Reasonably in advance of the commencement of such plants commercial operations, representatives of Purchaser and Sellers shall meet, negotiate and attempt to mutually agree upon the terms of an ethanol purchase agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Purchaser and the vendor.

EMPLOYEES AND BENEFITS  

  

 16.1 Employees in General. Within 15 days after the Effective Date, Seller will deliver, and the parties shall attach as _Exhibit AA,_ a list of all active employees at each of the Sites who work full or part time as managers, assistant managers, cashiers, coffee bar personnel and similar positions below the managers ("Station Employees"). Such list shall be updated by Sellers as necessary at any time prior to Closing. Sellers also have employees employed at its corporate office or in the field in various capacities, including auditors, supervisors, construction personnel, repair and maintenance personnel and other employees who do not work directly at a Site (collectively, "Corporate Employees"). 

  

 16.1.1 Offer of Employment. Purchaser shall offer regular, full-time employment to all active, regular, full-time Station Employees and regular, part-time employment to all active, regular, part-time Station Employees, in each case who are employed by Sellers immediately prior to the Closing, unless Sellers agrees with Purchaser that certain employees can be excluded from the offer of employment. Purchaser may at its election, but shall not have any obligation to, offer employment to one or more Corporate Employees. 

  

 16.1.2 Salaries and Wages. Purchaser shall employ the hired Station Employees at the same or, in the sole and absolute discretion of Purchaser, greater salaries or wages as were paid by Sellers immediately prior to the Closing. Where Purchaser has an executive incentive program or other bonus program, Purchaser shall include in such program the hired employees, in the same manner as similarly situated employees of Purchaser hired at the Closing Date. 

   ##### 

  

  

 16.1.3 Benefit Level. Purchaser shall provide the hired Station Employees with employee benefits that are substantially similar to those benefits currently provided by Purchaser to its similarly situated employees. 

  

 16.1.4 Service Credit. Each hired Station Employee shall receive credit for service from the date of employment by Sellers or any predecessor in ownership of the Sites, which date is identified in _Exhibit AA,_ for all purposes, including, but not limited to, vesting, eligibility, and benefit level (but not for purposes of the accrual of benefits under any defined benefit pension plan) purposes under all of Purchasers employee benefit plans, policies, and programs provided to its similarly situated employees. 

  

 16.1.5 Medical Plan and Dental Plan. Purchaser shall offer such medical plan and dental plan to the hired Station Employees as are currently offered to similarly situated employees of Purchaser as of the Closing in such a way as to maximize the likelihood of uninterrupted coverage of all hired Station Employees and eligible dependents. To the extent reasonably available to Purchaser under its existing medical plan and dental plan, hired Station Employees (i) shall be granted credit for any deductible and co-payment amounts paid by such Station Employees during the plan year in which the applicable Closing occurs, and (ii) shall not have pre-existing conditions excluded to the extent such conditions are otherwise covered under Purchasers plans. Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this Agreement unless otherwise determined in the sole discretion of Purchaser, Purchaser is not obligated to provide retiree medical benefits to any of the employees except, if at all, under and subject to such terms as it may decide. 

  

 16.2 Temporarily Inactive Employees. As of the Closing Date, all right to retain a Station Employee who, as of the Closing Date, is not an active employee due to a short-term disability or other leave of absence (other than for long-term disability), if any, shall be with Purchaser and not with Sellers. Purchaser shall offer employment to such temporarily inactive employees who applies for employment with Purchaser to the extent required by applicable law. 

  

 16.3 Terms of Employment. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to retain all Station Employees to be hired by Purchaser in their current positions up to the Closing, on the current terms of employment. Nothing in this Agreement shall (i) prevent Purchaser from exercising any reserved right contained in any of its employee benefit plans to amend, modify, suspend, revoke or terminate any such plan, so long as employees who are hired by Purchaser and remain in the employment of Purchaser are treated no less favorably than similarly situated employees of Purchaser, (ii) apply with respect to any equity-based compensation scheme of Purchaser, or (iii) require Purchaser to assume any obligation or liability with respect to any of Sellers existing employee benefits and pension plans, agreements, arrangements, or plans, whether or not subject to ERISA. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to be a guarantee of an employees continued employment with Purchaser. 

  

 16.4 Vacation Liability. Purchaser shall assume no liability for the vacation entitlement of employees who become employees of Purchaser for vacation time accrued prior to the Closing. Sellers shall pay off all such accrued vacation liability concurrently with the Closing. Sellers shall indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless from and against any such accrued vacation liability. Purchaser shall provide each Station Employee who is hired by Purchaser 

   ##### 

  

 

with unpaid time off equal to the vacation entitlement that Sellers pay off to
the employees at the Closing. From and after the Closing, each hired Station
Employee shall be eligible for paid vacation from Purchaser in accordance
with Purchasers vacation program for new employees. For purposes of
determining future vacation entitlement with Purchaser following the Closing,
each hired employee shall receive credit for service from the date of
employment by Sellers or any predecessor in ownership of the Sites as set
forth in Section 16.1.4. 

   

 16.5 Pension Plans. 

  

 16.5.1 Defined Contribution Plan. Purchaser agrees to accept into Purchasers 401(k) plan direct rollovers and elective transfers satisfying the requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.411(d)-4 QandA-3(b)(l) of hired Station Employees account balances (including pre-tax and post-tax contributions and loan balances) from Sellers savings plans for any hired Station Employee who so elects. Purchaser will have no obligation with respect to amounts attributable to Sellers savings plan other than acceptance of direct rollovers and elective transfers described above requested by hired Station Employees. 

  

 16.5.2 Sellers Representation. Sellers represent to Purchaser that: 

  

 16.5.2.1 Neither Sellers nor any person who is or was a member of a "controlled group" with Sellers within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA maintains or contributes to (or has maintained or contributed to) any employee benefit pension plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, or that is or was subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, and that could result in any liability on the part of Purchaser. 

  

 16.5.2.2 Sellers, and each person who is or was a member of a "controlled group" with Sellers within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code, and each group health plan of any such person, have complied in all material respects with the medical insurance coverage continuation requirements of Title I of ERISA and analogous state law ("COBRA continuation coverage"). 

  

 16.5.2.3 Each of Sellers savings plans has been determined to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and to Knowledge of any Seller nothing has occurred as to each which has resulted or is likely to result in the revocation of such qualification or which requires or could require action under the compliance resolution programs of the Internal Revenue Service to preserve such qualification. Sellers have delivered to Purchaser the most recently received IRS determination letter in respect of each of Sellers savings plans. 

  

 16.6 Workers Compensation and Employment-Related Claims. Sellers agree that, with respect to claims for workers compensation arising out of events occurring prior to the Closing and all employment-related claims, including any arising under Sellers employee benefit programs, by, or in respect of, persons employed by Sellers at the Assets arising out of events occurring prior to the Closing, regardless of whether such employment had terminated and regardless of whether such employee is employed by Purchaser, whether reported or unreported as of the Closing, and whether insured or uninsured (including, but not limited to, workers compensation, compensation, retirement, life insurance, medical and disability 

   ##### 

  

 

programs), Sellers shall, at their own expense, honor, or cause their
insurance carriers, if any, to honor, such claims (to the extent and in
proportion to any injury or obligation incurred prior to Closing) in
accordance with the terms and conditions of such programs or applicable
workers compensation statutes, including any construction of such terms or
conditions ultimately made by any court or administrative body having
jurisdiction therefor. Without limiting the scope of the preceding sentence,
Sellers shall be responsible for any and all claims and liabilities
arising out of or relating to (i) the employment of the employees or any
former employees of Sellers, including without limitation any pending
employment related claims or actions, (ii) the discharge by Sellers of any
such employee or former employee of Sellers, and (iii) the provision of
any employee benefits to such employees, former employees, retirees, or
disabled employees of Sellers (and their beneficiaries and eligible
dependents) attributable to their employment with, or their participation in
any plans or programs maintained or contributed to, by Sellers (including
without limitation the provision of COBRA continuation coverage). Purchaser
shall be responsible for all workers compensation claims for industrial
injuries and illnesses of employees hired by Purchaser occurring on or after
the Closing. 

   

 16.7 Pay Employees Until Closing. Sellers will pay all wages, salaries, bonuses and other sums due each employee through the close of business on the day prior to the Closing. For those employees whose shift begins the day prior to Closing but does not end until day of Closing, Sellers shall pay the full shift of such employees. 

  

 16.8 Change in Employee Compensation. Sellers will not increase the rate of compensation paid, or pay any bonus, to employees, except for those increases or bonuses made in the ordinary course of business consistent with Sellers past practices. Sellers agree to notify Purchaser of any increases or bonuses given. 

  

 16.9 Transition of Employees. From and after the execution of this Agreement and continuing after the Closing Date, Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate to ensure an orderly transition of the Station Employees who accept employment with Purchaser. 

  

 16.10 No Direct Benefit or Right of Action Conferred. The rights and obligations conferred by this Article 16 constitute contractual obligations of Sellers and Purchaser to one another, and are not intended to confer on any employee or other third party any direct benefit or right to enforce. 

  

ARTICLE 17 

   

INVENTORY PROCEDURES  

  

 The Inventory Price shall be determined by extending the physical inventory at the valuation methods set forth in _Exhibit BB._ At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay Sellers the sum of THREE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($3,500,000) on account of petroleum inventory and THREE MILLION DOLLARS ($3,000,000) on account of merchandise Inventory (the sum of such amounts, or $6,500,000, is referred to as the "Estimated Inventory Price"). On the day of the Closing or such other dates as may be mutually agreed by the parties, Purchaser and Sellers shall conduct or cause to be conducted an inventory audit or review (the "Inventory Review") of all Inventory located on the Sites in accordance with the 

   ##### 

  

 

procedures set forth in _Exhibit BB_ attached hereto. Purchaser and Sellers
recognize that to inventory all Sites could take up to three (3) or more days
and the procedure is designed to recognize this possibility. Based on the
Inventory Review, Purchaser and Sellers shall compute the final Inventory
Price. At the Closing, Purchaser shall wire transfer to Sellers the
Estimated Inventory Price, with such amount consisting of the estimate for
merchandise and the estimate for petroleum products. In the event that, upon
completion of the Inventory Review, Purchaser and Sellers cannot agree on the
proper Inventory Price, and related adjustment necessary due to the payment
by Purchaser of the Estimated Inventory Price, Purchaser shall immediately pay
Sellers by wire transfer the lower of the two amounts that Purchaser and
Sellers contend to be the proper Inventory Price, after first deducting the
Estimated Inventory Price payment previously made and contingent upon the
lower of the two amounts being greater than the Estimated Inventory Price.
If the lower of the two amounts is less than the Estimated Inventory Price,
Sellers shall immediately pay Purchaser such difference in amounts by wire
transfer. If Purchaser and Sellers are unable to resolve the dispute
regarding the Inventory Price, the same shall be submitted to arbitration
in accordance with the provisions of Article 27\. Upon resolution of the
dispute, whether by negotiation or arbitration, Sellers or Purchaser, as
appropriate, shall immediately pay, or retain, as applicable, the appropriate
amount as determined by the arbitrator or through negotiation. To the extent
that Purchaser and Sellers retain third parties to conduct one or more of the
Inventory Reviews, Purchaser shall pay the fees and expenses of such third
parties. Purchaser and Sellers shall mutually agree to any third parties and
shall mutually agree if the Inventory Review at any Site is not to be
conducted by a third party. 

   

ARTICLE 18 

   

TANK AND CONTAINMENT SYSTEM TESTING  

  

 18.1 Tank Tightness Certification. Sellers covenants to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Purchaser a certification, certificate or both ("Certification Documentation") for each and every one of the Sites, which Certification Documentation is the most recent certification issued prior to the Closing by, as appropriate, a state or federal licensed tester demonstrating that the underground fuel tanks and the fuel lines located at each of the Sites is in compliance with applicable Environmental Law leak detection requirements and secondary containment testing ("Tightness Certification"). Sellers shall deliver the most recent Certification Documentation no more than 4 weeks before Closing, and in no event shall a Tightness Certification be dated prior to August 1, 2006. In the event that Sellers are unable to obtain a Tightness Certification dated on or after August 1, 2006 for every Site as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall attempt to obtain a Tightness Certification post-Closing. Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for the costs associated with obtaining such Tightness Certification post-Closing and the costs of all repairs necessary to obtain such Tightness Certification as promptly as practicable after Purchaser delivers to Sellers invoices for such certification and repairs, but shall have no obligation to Purchaser for damages for lost profits. Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate in good faith in order to obtain the Tightness Certification, including granting access to the other as necessary. Nothing in this Article 18 shall be construed to limit the rights and obligations of the parties as contemplated in Article 7.

ARTICLE 19 

   

TERMINATION  

  

 19.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated (i) by mutual agreement of the parties, (ii) by any party in the event the Closing has not occurred by July 1, 2007, or October 1, 2007 if Purchaser has made the election set forth in Section 14.4 (as applicable, the "Termination Date"), (iii) by Purchaser in the event of any material breach by any Seller of the covenants, representations and warranties of Sellers in this Agreement which remains uncured thirty (30) days after Purchaser gives notice thereof, (iv) by any Seller in the event of any material breach by Purchaser of the covenants, representations and warranties of Purchaser in this Agreement which remains uncured thirty (30) days after a Seller gives notice thereof or (v) as otherwise contemplated by the terms of this Agreement. In the event of any termination in accordance with this Section 19.1, the parties shall have no further obligations under this Agreement, and all documents and funds deposited in the Escrow shall be returned to the depositing party within 5 business days, but such termination and/or return shall not affect any claims for breach of this Agreement arising prior to such termination. For the purposes of this Section 19.1 only, the term "material" shall be applied with respect to the Assets as a whole and not with respect to any individual Sites or Assets or any group thereof other than all of them, and "material" breaches of representations, warranties, covenants and agreements shall be those resulting in losses, penalties, costs, expenses, damages and liabilities of $27,700,000 in the aggregate. 

  

ARTICLE 20 

   

TRANSFER OR ISSUANCE OF PERMITS AND ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACTS  

  

 20.1 Transfer of Permits. It shall be Purchasers responsibility to seek the issuance or transfer of all environmental and other Permits; provided, however, that Sellers shall cooperate with any efforts of Purchaser, before and after Closing, to complete the actions required in connection with transferring or obtaining the issuance of all such Permits, including, Sellers right, title and interest in all operating permits, including beer and wine licenses, where applicable. To the extent Sellers cooperation would involve any material out-of-pocket expense, Sellers may condition their obligation with respect to such cooperation on Purchasers prior approval of and agreement to reimburse Sellers for such out-of-pocket expense. 

  

 20.2 Delays in Transfer or Issuance of Permits or Assignment of Contracts. If there are prohibitions against, or conditions to, the conveyance of any Contracts or Permits without the prior written consent of third parties, then any provision contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the transfer of title to, or assignment of, such Contracts or Permits pursuant to this Agreement shall not become effective unless and until such consent requirement is satisfied, waived or no longer applies. When and if such consent requirement is so satisfied, waived or no longer applies, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the assignment of such Contracts or Permits shall become effective automatically as of the Closing Date, without further action on the part of Sellers or Purchaser and without payment of further consideration. Each of Sellers and Purchaser agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to 

    ##### 

  

 

obtain satisfaction of any consent requirement on a timely basis; provided
that Sellers shall not be obligated to expend any moneys in connection with
satisfying any such consent requirement other than to cure existing defaults
or to satisfy pre-Closing obligations. To the extent that any consent
requirement for any Contract or Permits, or any required replacement Permit
issued to Purchaser, cannot be obtained, Sellers will, upon request of
Purchaser and at Purchasers expense, use its commercially reasonable efforts
(without infringing upon the legal rights of any outside party or violating
any applicable law) to provide Purchaser with the benefits of such Contracts
or Permits or equivalent contracts or permits effective as of the Closing
Date, provided Purchaser assumes all responsibilities, liabilities, costs and
expense under any such Contracts or Permits with respect to the period after
the Closing. 

   

ARTICLE 21 

   

TAXES AND PRORATIONS  

  

 21.1 Documentary Transfer Taxes and Certain Fees. 

  

 21.1.1 Sellers on the one hand and Purchaser on the other hand shall each pay one-half of (i) all real estate transfer tax imposed on the consideration from conveyance of real property under this Agreement and (ii) all recording, filing and escrow fees and closing costs imposed in connection with the conveyance of real property under this Agreement. 

  

 21.2 Other Taxes. 

  

 21.2.1 Sellers shall pay when due all sales, use, gross receipts or excise taxes and any environmental fees imposed upon the transfer of any part of the Assets pursuant to this Agreement, and shall deliver to Purchaser written evidence of such payment. Sellers shall indemnify and defend Purchaser and its Affiliates against, and shall hold them harmless from, and pay, any and all liabilities arising out of or resulting from any failure to pay any such taxes when due. 

  

 21.2.2 It is understood between Sellers and Purchaser that the consideration from the sale of certain of Sellers tangible personal property may be exempt from California sales tax as sale for resale as defined under California Revenue and Taxation Code Sections 6091-6092. Sellers and Purchaser agree to cooperate with each other to the extent possible to substantiate any values or claimed exemptions as required by the State of California. Purchaser shall provide to Sellers at the Closing a Resale Exemption certificate regarding the Inventory. 

  

 21.2.3 Sellers and Purchaser will provide each other with such cooperation and information as each may reasonably request of the other with regard to the preparation and filing of Returns, or the conduct of an audit or other proceeding in respect of taxes. 

  

 21.3 Prorations. The following prorations shall be made as of the date of Closing on the basis of a 365 day year: 

  

 21.3.1 For Fee Sites, real estate taxes shall be prorated as of the Closing based on the most recent tax statement ,for the Site. If such proration is not made on the basis of the 

   ##### 

  

 

current tax year, or if supplemental taxes are assessed after the Closing for
the period prior to the Closing, the parties shall make any necessary
adjustments after the Closing by cash payment to the party entitled thereto
so that Sellers shall have borne all taxes allocable to the period prior to
the Closing and Purchaser shall bear all taxes allocable to the period after
the Closing. 

   

 21.3.2 For Leased Sites, rent and other payments due under the Lease shall be prorated as of the Closing in the same manner as set forth in Sections 21.3.1 and 21.3.4. 

  

 21.3.3 Nonreimbursable utilities and operating expenses of the Sites shall be prorated as of the Closing on the assumption that utility charges were uniformly incurred during the billing period in which the Closing occurs. 

  

 21.3.4 Personal property taxes shall be prorated as of the Closing based on the most recent tax statements. If such proration is not made on the basis of the current tax year, or if supplemental taxes are assessed after the Closing for the period prior to the Closing, the parties shall make any necessary adjustments after the Closing by cash payment to the party entitled thereto so that Sellers shall have borne all taxes allocable to the period prior to the Closing and Purchaser shall bear all taxes allocable to the period after the Closing. 

  

 21.3.5 Prepaid expenses (including royalty payments) attributable to the Assets and payments due under the Contracts shall be prorated based on a schedule approved by Purchaser and Sellers. 

  

 21.4 Proration Schedule. The parties hereto and Escrow Holder shall use their respective best efforts to prepare and distribute among them a closing prorations schedule not later than seven business (7) days before the Closing. 

  

ARTICLE 22 

   

LIQUOR LICENSE TRANSFERS  

  

 22.1 Procedure. Attached hereto as _Exhibit CC_ is a list of all beer and wine licenses and liquor licenses held by Sellers for the Sites (the "Liquor Licenses"). Purchaser shall pay Sellers $1,000 for each of the Liquor Licenses at the Sites; such amount is included within the Purchase Price (the "License Consideration") and shall be withheld at closing to make payments as required pursuant this Article 22\. Unless otherwise required by the laws of the jurisdiction where the Site is located, there shall be no separate escrow for the License Consideration and the Liquor Inventory, except for the License Consideration and Liquor Inventory for California Sites Nos. 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 837 and 850 which have liquor licenses (rather than merely beer and wine licenses). The Parties agree that for California Sites, if permitted pursuant to California Business and Professions Code Section 24074.4, Sellers may deliver to the California Department of Alcohol Beverage Control a guaranty to Sellers creditors in conformity with such Section 24074.4 duly executed by USA Petroleum Corporation and that all claims of Sellers creditors with respect to Liquor Inventory shall first be satisfied pursuant to such guaranty. If any governing law requires an escrow for the transfer of a Liquor License and Liquor Inventory, without any alternative method (e.g. guaranty) agreeable by Sellers, then Sellers and Purchaser shall establish a separate escrow with Alcoholic Beverage Consulting 

   ##### 

  

 

Service ("ABC") or, if such company is unable to provide services outside of
California, such other escrow holder(s) as may be agreeable to the Parties
("ABC Escrow Holder") into which the License Consideration and the Liquor
Inventory consideration shall be deposited. Sellers and Purchaser hereby
instruct the ABC Escrow Holder to use the License Consideration and the Liquor
Inventory consideration to pay claims of Sellers creditors in compliance
with applicable law. Sellers shall use their best reasonable efforts and
shall take all actions reasonably required or necessary to facilitate the
transfer of the Liquor Licenses to Purchaser. If Sellers is unable to transfer
the Liquor License for any of the Sites on the date of Closing for the Site,
then (i) Sellers shall transfer possession of (but not title to) the Liquor
Inventory at the such Site(s) to Purchaser on the applicable Closing date for
the Site(s), which Purchaser shall hold for Sellers as a bailee, and (ii) if
there is no escrow, Purchaser shall hold the License Consideration and the
Liquor Inventory consideration for Sellers or, if there is an escrow, the ABC
Escrow Holder shall retain in escrow the portion of the License Consideration
and the Liquor Inventory consideration attributable to such Site(s). Sellers
shall transfer title to the Liquor Inventory at each Site to Purchaser upon
completion of transfer of the Liquor License for the Site. Upon such
transfer, Purchaser or the ABC Escrow Holder, as applicable, shall distribute
to Sellers the License Consideration and the Liquor Inventory consideration
for the Site, less any amounts paid to creditors under this Article 22\.
Purchasers obligation to consummate the purchase and sale of the Assets is
not conditioned upon transfer of the Liquor Licenses or the Liquor Inventory;
provided, however, that the closing of the purchase and sale of the Assets
shall be a condition precedent to transfer of the Liquor Licenses and the
Liquor Inventory. In the event that any of the Liquor Licenses are not
transferred on or before the date three months after the Closing Date for
any Site, then (i) to the extent previously deposited by Purchaser with
escrow, ABC Escrow Holder shall return the License Consideration and the
Liquor Inventory consideration for the particular Sites to Purchaser (without
interest) and neither Party shall have any further obligation with respect
to the transfer of the Liquor Licenses for the affected Sites and (ii)
Purchaser shall either return to Sellers the Liquor Inventory held by
Purchaser as a bailee from the date of Closing or pay to Sellers the cash
value of the Liquor Inventory (without interest) as of the date of Closing for
the affected Sites. All escrow costs shall be divided equally between Sellers
and Purchaser. Purchaser shall be responsible for all license fees and
transfer fees in connection with the transfer of the Liquor Licenses. 

   

ARTICLE 23 

   

ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATES  

  

 23.1 Estoppel Certificates. For each Leased Site, Sellers shall, as a condition to the Closing, obtain from the Landlord a full and complete estoppel certificate (each, an "Estoppel Certificate") substantially in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit J_, duly executed by the Landlord and certifying for the benefit of Purchaser (i) that the Lease is in full force and effect, (ii) that there are no defaults on the part of Sellers or the Landlord, (iii) the current monthly rent due under the Lease, (iv) the date to which all rents have been paid, (v) that, if required under the terms of the Lease, the Landlord consents to the assignment of the Lease to Purchaser, and (vi) such other matters as Purchaser may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall be deemed to satisfy the closing condition described in Section 3.4.1.6 and this Article 23 if Estoppel Certificates are not obtained for ten or less Leased Sites by Closing and Sellers deliver 

   ##### 

  

 

a certification pursuant to Section 23.2 for each such Leased Site for which
an Estoppel Certificate is not obtained. 

   

 23.2 Sellers Certifications in Lieu of Estoppel Certificates. In the event that, despite good faith efforts, Sellers are unable to obtain an Estoppel Certificate from one or more of the Landlords, Sellers may deliver, with respect to no more than ten Sites in the aggregate, a certification in lieu of an Estoppel Certificate, executed by a duly authorized officer of a Seller, setting forth the matters required to be included in the Estoppel Certificate. Without limiting any other requirement hereunder, such certification in lieu of an Estoppel Certificate shall constitute a representation by Sellers that the matters set forth therein are true, complete and not misleading. 

  

ARTICLE 24 

   

ASSIGNMENT  

  

 24.1 Limitation on Assignment. Except as may be necessary in order to effect a like-kind exchange pursuant to the terms of Article 25, Sellers shall have no right to assign all or any part of this Agreement without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent may be granted or withheld by Purchaser in Purchasers sole and absolute discretion. In addition to such assignments as may be necessary in order to effect a like-kind exchange pursuant to the terms of Article 25, Purchaser may assign its rights under this Agreement or designate a nominee to take title to the Assets to any Affiliate of Purchaser without the consent of Sellers by delivering written notice of such assignment or nomination to Sellers and Escrow Holder together with an assignment and assumption agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit DD._ For purposes of this Section 24.1 only, "Affiliate" shall mean, as used with respect to any Person (as defined below), any other Person or Persons directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with, such Person. For purposes of this definition, "Person" or "Persons" shall mean any individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, trust, or other legal entity and the term "control" (including the correlative meanings of the terms "controlling," "controlled by" and "under common control with"), as used with respect to any Person or Persons, shall mean (x) the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management policies of such Person or Persons, whether through the ownership of voting securities or by contract or otherwise and/or (y) ownership in such Person or Persons of fifty-one percent (51%) or more of all equity, capital and profit interests. In any assignment under this Agreement, the assignor shall bind the assignee in respect to such assigned interests to assume the obligations of assignor under this Agreement. Otherwise, Purchaser shall not have the right to assign its interest in this Agreement or designate a nominee to take title to the Assets without obtaining the prior written consent of Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. In this regard, in the event that Sellers fails to respond within five (5) business days following such request for consent, then Sellers shall be deemed to have provided such consent. To the extent any assignment of Purchasers interest in this Agreement is consented to by Sellers or permitted by this provision, the term "Purchaser," as used in this Agreement, shall include such permitted assignee. Any assignment permitted hereunder shall not relieve the assignor of its obligations hereunder, including but not limited to the indemnities and other covenants in this Agreement, and shall not delay the Closing in any way. Any 

   ##### 

  

 

assignment document shall provide that assignor is not relieved of its
obligations as set forth in this Agreement. 

   

 24.2 Scope of Permitted Assignments. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon the parties and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns, except that any such assignment shall not relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement is not intended to, and does not create, any rights in any third parties. 

  

 24.3 Post-Closing Assignments. After the Closing, upon the sale of any or all of the Sites, Purchaser, and Purchasers successors in interest shall have the right from time-to-time to transfer any rights accruing to the benefit of Purchaser, or Purchasers successors, as applicable, hereunder, that survived the Closing, including, without limitation, Sellers environmental obligations related to the Assets as set forth in Article 7 herein. Likewise after the Closing, upon the sale of any or all of the Sites, Purchaser, and Purchasers successors in interest, shall obligate and bind any subsequent acquirer of any or all of the Sites, to assume Purchasers obligations as set forth in this Agreement in respect to such Site or Sites. Upon the request of Purchaser, or Purchasers successors in interest, as applicable, Sellers shall issue a certificate for the benefit of Purchaser, or Purchasers successors, as applicable, and a designated party evidencing Sellers continuing obligations under the Agreement. As an accommodation to Sellers Purchaser, or Purchasers successors in interest, as applicable, shall notify Sellers of any said assignment within thirty (30) days of the completion of the assignment. This Section 24.3 shall survive the Closing, and any subsequent closings. 

  

ARTICLE 25 

   

TAX DEFERRED EXCHANGE  

  

 The parties agree that either party may consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement through a tax deferred exchange which qualifies for non-recognition of gain under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. If Purchaser or Sellers desire to effect such exchange, it shall give written notice to the other at least twenty (20) days prior to the Closing of its intention to do so. Upon receipt of such notice, the parties shall cooperate with each other in attempting to effectuate such exchange, including, but not limited to, the execution of such agreements and other documents as may be reasonably necessary to complete and otherwise effectuate the tax deferred exchange, provided that: (a) a partys obligations hereunder shall not be increased; (b) such documents shall not modify a partys representations, warranties or obligations hereunder; (c) the Purchase Price paid by Purchaser shall not be different from that which Purchaser would have paid pursuant to Article 2; (d) the non-exchanging party shall not incur any additional cost, expense, liability or undue burden as a result of its cooperation in such exchange; and (e) neither party shall be required to take title to any real property not part of the Assets.

ARTICLE 26 

   

PAYMENTS  

  

 26.1 Form and Method of Payment. All references herein to dollars ($) refer to U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise specified herein, any payment to be made hereunder shall be made in U.S. dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds, without discount or deduction, or by such other means as the parties may agree in writing. 

  

 26.2 Interest on Past Due Payments. Any amount not paid by either party when due hereunder, or in any associated agreements, shall bear interest from the date upon which payment was due through the date of payment at a rate equal to one percent (1%) above the prime rate of interest as announced by Bank of America, NA, from time to time. 

  

ARTICLE 27 

   

ARBITRATION  

  

 27.1 Negotiation of Disputes and Disagreements. In the event of any controversy or claim ("Claim"), whether based on contract, tort, statute or other legal or equitable theory (including, but not limited to, any claim of fraud, misrepresentation or fraudulent inducement or any question of validity or effect of this Agreement including this Section) arising out of or related to this Agreement (including any amendments or extensions and any documents delivered or to be delivered pursuant hereto), or the breach or termination thereof, which the parties have been unable to settle or agree upon within a period of thirty (30) days after the dispute or disagreement arises, each party shall nominate a senior officer of its management to meet at a mutually agreed time and place not later than forty five (45) days after the dispute or disagreement has arisen to attempt to resolve such dispute or disagreement. Should a resolution of such dispute or disagreement not be obtained within fifteen (15) days after nomination of senior officers for such purpose, either party may then, by notice to the other, submit the dispute to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Section 27.2. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser shall have the right to seek specific performance of this Agreement and any related injunctions in a court of law, in lieu of arbitration. 

  

 27.2 Arbitration Resolution. Any Claim shall be submitted to binding arbitration before a single arbitrator conducted by JAMS-Endispute, Santa Monica, California in accordance with its then-current rules and procedures. The arbitration shall be held in Los Angeles, California. Sellers and Purchaser shall attempt to select a mutually agreed to individual to serve as the single arbitrator within fifteen (15) days following the date that either party receives a notice to arbitrate. Within five (5) business days after Purchaser or Sellers receive a notice to arbitrate, Purchaser and Sellers shall provide the other with a list of three (3) names of current JAMS-Endispute arbitrators. If the name of one arbitrator is listed by each party, the parties agree to use that arbitrator. If more than one arbitrator is on the list, the parties shall use the arbitrator with the lowest hourly rate. If Sellers and Purchaser do not list one of the same arbitrators on the respective lists, they shall request the Santa Monica, California office of JAMS-Endispute to submit to them a list identifying five (5) of its members qualified to conduct 

   ##### 

  

 

an arbitration involving the issue raised in the notice to arbitrate, in
accordance with JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedure. Sellers,
on the one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand, may each strike two (2)
persons from the list. If Sellers and Purchaser are unable to select an
arbitrator from the remaining persons on the list (for example, if there is
more than one individual remaining on the list), JAMS-Endispute shall select
the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall determine the Claims of the parties and
render a final award in accordance with the law of the State of California.
The arbitrator shall set forth the reasons for the award in writing. 

   

 27.3 Conduct of the Arbitration. Arbitration shall be subject to the following additional provisions: 

  

 27.3.1 the hearing shall be conducted on a confidential basis without continuance or adjournment; 

  

 27.3.2 any offer made or the details of any negotiation of the dispute subject to arbitration prior to arbitration shall not be admissible; 

  

 27.3.3 Purchaser and Sellers shall be entitled to all rights and privileges granted by the arbitrator to the other; 

  

 27.3.4 each party shall be entitled to compel the attendance of witnesses or production of documents, and for this purpose, the arbitrator shall have the power to issue subpoenas in accordance with the law of the State of California; 

  

 27.3.5 each party shall have the right (upon leave of the arbitrator) to take depositions and obtain other discovery of the scope and in the manner which the arbitrator deems reasonably necessary to the preparation and presentation of the partys case; 

  

 27.3.6 the arbitrator shall have the power to impose on any party such terms, conditions, consequences, liabilities, sanctions and penalties as they deem necessary or appropriate (which shall be conclusive, final and enforceable as the award on the merits) to compel or induce compliance with discovery and the appearance of, or production of documents in the custody of, any officer, director, agent or employee of a party or any Affiliate of such party; 

  

 27.3.7 the arbitrator shall award reasonable attorneys fees and costs, and the costs of arbitration, including the fees charged by the arbitrator and by JAMS-Endispute, to any substantially prevailing party; and 

  

 27.3.8 the arbitrator shall schedule the arbitration within ninety (90) days after the appointment of the arbitrator and render his or her decision in writing within sixty (60) days after the arbitration is concluded. 

  

 27.4 Breach. The parties recognize that irreparable injury will result from a breach of any provision of this Agreement and that money damages will be inadequate to fully remedy the injury. In order to prevent such irreparable injury, the arbitrator shall have the power to grant temporary or permanent injunctive or other equitable relief. Prior to the appointment of an 

   ##### 

  

  

arbitrator, a party may, notwithstanding any other provision of this
agreement, seek temporary injunctive relief from any court of competent
jurisdiction; provided that the party seeking such relief shall (if
arbitration has not already been commenced) simultaneously commence
arbitration. Such court-ordered relief shall not continue more than ten (10)
days after the appointment of the arbitrator (or in any event for longer than
sixty (60)days). 

   

 27.5 Arbitration Awards. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator is final and binding upon the parties. The parties hereby consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the state or federal courts of the State of California for the enforcement of any award rendered by the arbitrator.

AMENDMENTS  

  

 This Agreement cannot be altered, amended, changed or modified in any respect or particular unless each such alteration, amendment, change or modification shall have been agreed to by each of the parties and reduced to writing in its entirety and signed and delivered by each party. 

  

ARTICLE 29 

   

SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  

  

 All obligations of the parties contained herein which by their terms do not arise until after the Closing, and any other provisions of this Agreement which by their terms survive the Closing, shall survive the Closing. All representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing. It is the parties intent that such surviving representations and warranties shall not merge in the Closing or in the conveyancing instruments delivered at the Closing. All representations and warranties of Sellers related to title matters 

   ##### 

  

 

pursuant to Section 5.19 above or pursuant to the Grant Deeds shall survive
forever. All representations and warranties of Sellers related to taxes or
tax matters shall survive until the expiration of the last applicable statute
of limitations period. All other representations and warranties of Sellers
hereunder shall survive for a period of eighteen (18) months after
the Closing. Nothing set forth in this Article 29 shall in any way limit or
effect the survival of Sellers covenants and Sellers environmental
obligations set forth in this Agreement. 

   

ARTICLE 30 

   

SELLERS COOPERATION WITH PURCHASER  

  

 Sellers agree to cooperate with Purchaser in providing for an orderly transition of the Assets. The provisions of this Article 30 shall survive the Closing. 

  

ARTICLE 31 

   

INDEMNITIES/DAMAGES  

  

 Sellers agree, acknowledge and covenant that they jointly and severally retain all liabilities, and shall be responsible for discharging all obligations relating to the ownership and/or operation of the Assets prior to the Closing, whether by any Seller or prior owners of the Assets (other than, with regards to Assets previously owned by Purchaser, obligations and liabilities arising during or prior to Purchasers previous ownership), as set forth in this Agreement, including matters shown on _Exhibit U_ and _Exhibit V._ Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, including the specific limitations on environmental liabilities set forth in Article 7, Sellers shall jointly and severally assume, discharge, protect (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser), indemnify and hold Purchaser, its parent, subsidiaries and Affiliates and their respective officers, employees, attorneys, business invitees, guests, customers, contractors and agents harmless from and against each and every liability in any way pertaining or relating to (i) a breach of any representation or warranty of any Seller contained herein, either as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date, subject to the provisions pertaining to representations and warranties in this Article 31 below, (ii) a breach of any covenant contained herein, (iii) any Taxes of Sellers or (iv) the Assets, or any portion thereof or any interest therein, including, without limitation, the use, ownership or operation of the Assets by any person (including, without limitation, Sellers and any prior owner of the Assets other than, with regards to Assets previously owned by Purchaser, Purchaser and all owners prior to Purchasers previous ownership) arising on or before the Closing or existing as of the Closing applicable to the Asset in question or arising thereafter with respect to any period of time prior thereto. Except as otherwise provided in the Trademark License Agreement with respect to Sellers use of the Licensed Trademarks, Purchaser shall assume, discharge, indemnify and hold Sellers, its parent, subsidiaries and Affiliates and their respective officers, employees, attorneys, business invitees, guests, customers, contractors and agents harmless from and against each and every liability in any way pertaining or relating to the Assets, or any portion thereof or any interest therein, arising for the first time after the Closing and with respect to any period of time subsequent thereto that Purchaser owns the Assets. The foregoing is not intended to waive, and shall not constitute a waiver by Purchaser, of Purchasers rights against Sellers in the event Sellers shall have failed to 

   ##### 

  

 

comply with any of the covenants, agreements, representations, warranties,
terms and conditions to be performed and complied with by Sellers.
Furthermore, in the event of such a breach by any Seller, Sellers liability
shall not be in any way satisfied, reduced or excused by virtue of any rights
granted to Purchaser to investigate the Assets or by any information which
Purchaser may acquire by virtue of such investigation. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, except with respect to Sellers
title and Tax representations and warranties (to which none of the
limitations set forth in this sentence applies), Sellers aggregate liability
for indemnification with respect to all Claims by Purchaser for breach of
representations and warranties under or related to this Agreement (i) shall
be conditioned on a Claim being made therefore by Purchaser within 18 months
after the Closing Date; (ii) shall not apply unless the aggregate damage
amount of all Claims shall exceed ONE MILLION DOLLARS ($1,000,000), in which
case only the aggregate damage amount exceeding ONE MILLION DOLLARS
($1,000,000) shall be indemnified, and (iii) shall not exceed SEVENTY MILLION
DOLLARS ($70,000,000). For the avoidance of doubt, none of Sellers
indemnities under this Agreement (other than clause (i) above for breach
of representations and warranties), and none of Sellers covenants under this
Agreement, shall be subject to the limitations of the immediately preceding
sentence. Neither party shall have liability under this Agreement for
exemplary or punitive damages or damages for lost profits, except those
awarded to a third party. The rights and obligations conferred by this Article
31 constitute contractual obligations of Sellers and Purchaser to one another
and are not intended to confer on any other third party, except successors or
assignees of Purchaser as provided in this Agreement, any benefit or right to
enforce. Nothing in this Article 31 shall limit any liability with respect to
fraud. With regard to any indemnity claim concerning representations
and warranties for title, Purchaser shall first be required to pursue such
claim against the Title Policy. 

   

ARTICLE 32

Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, Purchaser and Sellers shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy the conditions to Closing and otherwise consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practical. TIME AND EACH OF THE TERMS, 

    ##### 

  

  

COVENANTS, CONDITIONS AND CONTINGENCIES OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY
MADE OF THE ESSENCE. 

   

 32.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and any party may execute any such counterpart, each of which when executed by both parties and delivered shall be deemed to be an original. It shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement or any counterparts hereof to produce or account for any of the other counterparts. 

  

 32.11 Extensions of Time; Waiver. It is agreed that any party to this Agreement may extend time for performance by any other party or waive the performance of any obligation of any other party or waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party, but any such waiver shall be in writing, and shall not constitute or be construed as a waiver of any other obligation, condition, representation or warranty under this Agreement. 

  

 32.12 Further Assurances. Purchaser and Sellers shall take such additional action, and shall cooperate with one another, as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the terms of this Agreement and any agreement or instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 32.13 No Presumption Against Drafter. Purchaser and Sellers have each fully participated in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an ambiguity, question of intent or question of interpretation arises, this Agreement must be construed as if drafted jointly, and there must not be any presumption, inference or conclusion drawn against either party by virtue of the fact that its representative or counsel have authored this Agreement or any of its terms. 

  

 32.14 Expenses. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, each party to this Agreement shall bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including attorneys fees and expenses. Purchaser shall bear the fees and expenses of Manatt, Phelps and Phillips, LLP in connection with representation of the parties regarding public relations and contacts with governmental agencies and authorities necessary to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 32.15 Interpretation. The use of the phrase "including," or phrases of similar import, shall be deemed to include the phrase "without limitation". 

  

 32.16 Attorneys Fees. Without limiting the arbitration requirements set forth in this Agreement, in any action or Claim between the parties hereto seeking the enforcement of any of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, or in connection with the Assets or the Escrow, the prevailing party in such action shall be awarded, in addition to damages, injunctive or other relief, its reasonable costs and expenses, and reasonable attorneys fees. 

  

 32.17 Force Majeure. Sellers and Purchaser shall not be responsible for any loss or breach due to delay in delivery or performance hereunder caused by third parties, governmental regulations, outbreak of a state of emergency, acts of God, war or terrorist event, civil commotion, riots, epidemics, earthquakes or other natural casualties, fires, strikes, walk-outs, or other similar cause or causes beyond the control of the parties. The parties shall exercise reasonable diligence to remedy any condition of force majeure and resume performance hereunder, and the suspension for force majeure shall not continue beyond any time when a party 

   ##### 

  

 

so affected could resume performance through the exercise of reasonable
diligence; provided however, that neither party shall be obligated to settle
any strikes or labor disputes on terms it deems unsatisfactory. 

   

 32.18 Condition of Assets. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL OF THE ASSETS TO BE CONVEYED HEREUNDER WILL BE CONVEYED ON AN "AS IS," WHERE IS," AND "WITH ALL FAULTS" BASIS AT THE CLOSING. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, SELLERS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, CONCERNING THE PHYSICAL CONDITION, UTILITY, FITNESS OR OPERATIBILITY OF ANY OF THE ASSETS, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR OF FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR OR ORDINARY USES OR PURPOSES. PURCHASER HEREBY WAIVES THE UNIFORM COMMERICAL CODE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ALL OTHER IMPLIED WARRANTES WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSETS. 

  

 32.19 Bulk Sales. Except in relation to the transfer of the liquor licenses as set forth hereinabove, Sellers and Purchaser agree to waive compliance with any applicable bulk sales laws. Sellers shall indemnify, defend and protect (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser) Purchaser and its Affiliates against, and shall hold them harmless from, and pay, any and all losses, penalties, costs, expenses, damages and liabilities arising out of or resulting from any failure to comply with or perform any action in connection with such bulk sales provisions as they apply to the transfer of the Assets consistent with this Agreement. Sellers shall comply with the bulk sales tax notice requirement of the State of California. 

  

 32.20 Judicial Notice. In different sections of this Agreement, Purchaser has the right to reduce the Purchase Price by the amount of $1,800,000 per Site. Purchaser and Sellers have chosen this $1,800,000 number at random, and such number shall in no way be attributed as the value the parties assigned to any particular Sites, but rather as a mechanism to facilitate the Closing. The actual value of any particular Site is to be determined post-closing by the parties hereto, and if said parties are unable to agree on said values, by the arbitrator in accordance with Article 27 above. 

  

 32.21 Facsimiles. This Agreement may be delivered to Escrow Holder and the other parties by facsimile transmission. 

  

 32.22 Joint and Several Liability. All obligations of Sellers under this Agreement are joint and several and each Seller shall be fully liable for the obligations of Sellers hereunder. The obligation of each Seller under this Agreement shall be direct and independent of and not secondary to the obligations of any other Seller. Each Seller expressly waives any right to require Purchaser to (i) proceed against any other Seller or any other person; (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security or (iii) pursue any other remedy. Purchaser may exercise or not exercise any right or remedy it has against any other Seller or any security it holds (including the right to foreclose by judicial or nonjudicial sale) without affecting any Sellers liability hereunder. Each Seller further expressly waives any rights to participate in any security held by Purchaser, any demands for performance, notices of nonperformance or the benefit of any act or omission by Purchaser which directly or indirectly results in or aids the discharge of any other Seller from 

   ##### 

  

 

any of the obligations under this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise.
Each Seller acknowledges that, to the extent such Seller has or may have
rights of subrogation or reimbursement against any other Seller for claims
arising out of this Agreement, those rights may be impaired or destroyed if
Purchaser elects to proceed against any real property security of such other
Seller by non-judicial foreclosure. That impairment or destruction could,
under certain judicial cases and based on equitable principles of estoppel,
give rise to a defense by a Seller against its obligations under this
Agreement. Each Seller waives that defense and any others arising
from Purchasers election to pursue non-judicial foreclosure. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Seller expressly waives all
rights, benefits and defenses, if any, applicable or available to it under
either California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 580a or 726,
which provide, among other things, that the amount of any deficiency judgment
which may be recovered following either a judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure
sale is limited to the difference between the amount of any indebtedness owed
and the greater of the fair value of the security or the amount for which the
security was actually sold. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each Seller further expressly waives all rights, benefits and defenses, if
any, applicable or available to it under either California Code of Civil
Procedure Sections 580b, providing that no deficiency may be recovered on a
real property purchase money obligation, or 580d, providing that
no deficiency may be recovered on an obligation secured by a deed of trust on
real property if the real property is sold under a power of sale contained in
the deed of trust. No failure on the part of Purchaser to exercise, no delay
in exercising and no course of dealing with respect to, any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right. No compromise, settlement, release, renewal,
extension, indulgence, change in, waiver or modification of any of the
obligations under this Agreement, or the release or discharge of any other
Seller from its performance of any of the obligations of Sellers hereunder
shall release or discharge any Seller from the performance of the obligations
hereunder.
