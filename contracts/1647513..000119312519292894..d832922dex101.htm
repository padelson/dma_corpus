qualifications, reservations and encumbrances with respect thereto that could
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect and (b) such rights-of-way that, if not obtained,
could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect; and each of the Partnership and the Subsidiaries has
fulfilled and performed, in all material respects, its obligations with

a Material Adverse Effect; and the Partnership Entities own or possess or

and other authorizations (" _Permits_ ") and have properly filed with the
appropriate authorities all notices, applications and other documents
necessary to lease or own their respective properties and to carry on their
respective businesses as presently conducted, except where the failure to
possess such licenses or authorizations or make such filings would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. No event has occurred that would prevent the Permits

time would allow, revocation or termination thereof or results in any
impairment of the rights of the holder of any such Permit. None of the

trade names or other intellectual property (collectively, " _Intellectual
Property_ ") necessary to carry on the business now operated by them, and none
of the Partnership nor any of the Subsidiaries has received any notice or is
otherwise aware of any infringement of or conflict with asserted rights of
others with respect to any Intellectual Property or of any facts or
circumstances that would render any Intellectual Property invalid or
inadequate to protect the interest of the Partnership or any of the
Subsidiaries therein, and which infringement or conflict (if the subject of
any unfavorable decision, ruling or finding) or invalidity or inadequacy,
singly or in the aggregate, would result in a Material Adverse Effect.

by any of the Partnership or any of the Subsidiaries under any such policy or
instrument as to which any insurance company is denying liability or
defending under a reservation of rights clause; and none of the Partnership or
any of the Subsidiaries has any reason to believe that it will not be able to
renew its existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or
to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to
continue its business at a cost that could not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Purchasers for a brokerage commission, finders fee or like payment in
connection with the offering and sale of the Purchased Units. The Partnership
agrees that it will indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser from and
against any and all claims, demands or liabilities for brokers, finders,
placement or other similar fees or commissions incurred by the Partnership in
connection with the purchase of the Purchased Units or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 3.32 _No Side Agreements_. There are no agreements by, among or
between the Partnership or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby other than the Operative Documents nor
promises or inducements for future transactions between or among any of such
parties.

Section 3.33 _No Registration_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations
and warranties of the Purchaser contained in _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ and
_Section_ __ _ 4.7_, the issuance and sale of the Purchased Units pursuant to
this Agreement is exempt from registration requirements of the Securities
Act, and neither the Partnership nor, to the knowledge of the Partnership, any
authorized Representative acting on its behalf has taken or will take any
action hereafter that would cause the loss of such exemption. 

Section 3.34 _No Integration_. The Partnership has not, directly or through
any agent, issued, sold, offered for sale, solicited offers to buy or
otherwise negotiated in respect of, any security (as defined in the Securities
Act), that is or will be integrated with the issuance and sale of the
Purchased Units contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the
Securities Act, the rules and regulations thereunder or the interpretations
thereof by the Commission.

Section 3.35 _MLP Status_. The Partnership is properly treated as a
partnership for United States federal income tax purposes, and more than 90%
of the Partnerships gross income for the current period is, and for each of
the Partnerships taxable years ending after September 20, 2016 has been,
"qualifying income" under Section 7704(d) of the Code.

Section 3.36 _Qualifying Income of Contributed Interests_. After the closing
date of the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, the
Partnership expects that more than 90% of the gross income of the Partnership
in 2019 will be "qualifying income" under Section 7704(d) of the Code.

Section 3.37 _Investment Company_. The Partnership is and, as of the Closing
Date after giving effect to the offer and sale of the Purchased Units and the
application of the proceeds therefrom, will not be, (a) an "investment
company" or a company "controlled" by an "investment company" within the
meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and
regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the " _Investment
Company Act_ ") or (b) a "business development company" (as defined in
Section 2(a)(48) of the Investment Company Act).

Section 3.38 _Disclosure Controls and Procedures_. To the extent required by
Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, the Partnership has established and
maintains an effective system of "disclosure controls and procedures" (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that
complies with the requirements of the Exchange Act; the Partnerships
"disclosure controls and procedures" are reasonably designed to ensure that
all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
the Partnership in the reports to be filed or submitted under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the

 



29

    

 time periods specified in the Exchange Act, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Partnerships management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of
the General Partner required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports.

 

Section 3.39 _Internal Controls_. The Partnership Entities maintain systems of
"internal control over financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) that comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
have been designed by, or under the supervision of, their respective principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP, including, but not limited to, internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (a)
transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or specific
authorizations; (b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
asset accountability; (c) access to assets is permitted only in accordance
with managements general or specific authorization; and (d) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. As
of the date of the most recent balance sheet of the Partnership and
its consolidated subsidiaries reviewed or audited by KPMG LLP, there were no
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the Partnerships internal
controls. Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports, the Partnership is not aware
of (i) any material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting
or (ii) any change in internal control over financial reporting that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Partnerships internal control over financial reporting.

Section 3.40 _Placement Agent Reliance_. The Partnership acknowledges that
each of the Placement Agents may rely upon the representations and warranties
made by the Partnership to each Purchaser in this Agreement.

 

Section 3.41 _Legal Sufficiency of the Contribution Agreement_. The
Contribution Agreement is legally sufficient to transfer or convey to the
Partnership (a) all of the transferors right, title and interest in and to
the Contributed Interests and (b) all of the ownership interests, assets and
rights in and to the Contributed Interests purported to be transferred
thereby, subject to the conditions, reservations, encumbrances and limitations
contained in the Contribution Agreement. The Partnership, upon consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement, will directly
or indirectly succeed in all material respects to the Contributed Interests.

Section 3.42 _Absence of Price Manipulation_. Neither the Partnership nor, to
the knowledge of the Partnership, any of its Affiliates or its or their
respective directors or officers, has taken, or will take, directly or
indirectly, any action designed to, or that might reasonably be expected to,
cause or result in stabilization or manipulation of the price of the Common
Units to facilitate the sale or resale of the Purchased Units in violation of
Regulation M under the Exchange Act.

Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly, hereby represents and warrants to
the Partnership that:

 

Section 4.1 _Existence_. Such Purchaser is duly organized and validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, with
all requisite power and authority to own, lease, use and operate its
properties and to conduct its business as currently conducted, except where
the failure to have such power or authority would not prevent
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Registration Rights Agreement.

Section 4.2 _Authorization, Enforceability_. Such Purchaser has all necessary
corporate, limited liability company or partnership power and authority to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the
Registration Rights Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, and the execution, delivery and performance by such
Purchaser of this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement has been
duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of such Purchaser; and
this Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement constitute the legal,
valid and binding obligations of such Purchaser, enforceable in accordance
with their terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.

 

Section 4.3 _No Breach_. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement by such Purchaser and the
consummation by such Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby will not (a) conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any
of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, any
material agreement to which such Purchaser is a party or by which such
Purchaser is bound or to which any of the property or assets of such Purchaser
is subject, (b) conflict with or result in any violation of the provisions of
any certificate of limited partnership, formation or incorporation, agreement
of limited partnership, limited liability company agreement, bylaws or any
other organizational documents of such Purchaser, or (c) violate any statute,
order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having
jurisdiction over such Purchaser or the property or assets of such Purchaser,
except in the cases of _clauses (a)_ and _(c)_ , for such conflicts,
breaches, violations or defaults as would not prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Registration Rights
Agreement.

Section 4.4  _Certain Fees_. No fees or commissions are or will be payable by
such Purchaser to brokers, finders, or investment bankers with respect to the
purchase of any of the Purchased Units or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.5 _No Side Agreements_. There are no other agreements by, among or
between such Purchaser and any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the
Partnership or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, other than the Operative Documents, nor
promises or inducements for future transactions between or among any of such
parties.

 



31

    

Section 4.6 _Investment_. The Purchased Units are being acquired for
such Purchasers own account, the account of its Affiliates, or the accounts
of clients for whom such Purchaser exercises discretionary investment
authority (all of whom such Purchaser hereby represents and warrants are
"accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D
promulgated by the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act), not as a
nominee or agent, and with no present intention of distributing the Purchased
Units or any part thereof, and such Purchaser has no present intention of
selling or granting any participation in or otherwise distributing the same in
any transaction in violation of the securities laws of the United States or
any state, without prejudice, however, to such Purchasers right at all times
to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Purchased Units under a
registration statement under the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws or under an exemption from such registration available
thereunder (including, without limitation, if available, Rule 144 promulgated
thereunder). If such Purchaser should in the future decide to dispose of any
of the Purchased Units, the Purchaser understands and agrees (a) that it may
do so only in compliance with the Securities Act and applicable state
securities law, as then in effect, including a sale contemplated by any
registration statement pursuant to which such securities are being offered, or
pursuant to an exemption from the Securities Act, and (b) that stop-transfer
instructions to that effect will be in effect with respect to such securities.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Purchaser may at any time enter into one
or more over-the-counter transactions with respect to such Purchasers
Purchased Units with a third party, provided that such transactions
referencing the Common Units are exempt from registration under
the Securities Act.

Section 4.7 _Nature of Purchaser_. Such Purchaser represents and warrants to,
and covenants and agrees with, the Partnership that, (a) it is an "accredited
investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated by the
Commission pursuant to the Securities Act, (b) by reason of its business and
financial experience it has such knowledge, sophistication and experience in
making similar investments and in business and financial matters generally so
as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective
investment in the Purchased Units and (c) is able to bear the economic risk
of such investment and, at the present time, would be able to afford a
complete loss of such investment.

 

Section 4.8 _Restricted Securities_. Such Purchaser understands that the
Purchased Units are characterized as "restricted securities" under the
federal securities Laws inasmuch as they are being acquired from the
Partnership in a transaction not involving a public offering and that under
such Laws and applicable regulations such securities may not be resold
absent registration under the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom. In
this connection, such Purchaser represents that it is knowledgeable with
respect to Rule 144 of the Commission promulgated under the Securities Act.

 

Section 4.9 _Legend_. Such Purchaser understands that the book entry
evidencing the Purchased Units will bear the legend required by the
Partnership Agreement as well as a legend substantively consistent with the
following legend: "These securities have not been registered under the
Securities Act. These securities may not be sold or offered for sale except
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or
pursuant to an exemption from registration thereunder, in each case in
accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states or other
jurisdictions, and in the case of a transaction exempt from registration,
such securities may only be transferred if the transfer agent for such
securities has received documentation satisfactory to it that such transaction
does not require registration under the Securities Act."

 



32

    

Section 4.10 _Partnership Information_. Such Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that the Partnership has provided or made available to such Purchaser
(through EDGAR, the Partnerships website or otherwise) all SEC Reports, as
well as all press releases or investor presentations issued by the Partnership
through the date of this Agreement that are included in a filing by the
Partnership on Form 8-K or clearly posted on the Partnerships website.

 

Section 4.11 _Placement Agent Reliance_. Such Purchaser agrees that each of
the Placement Agents may rely upon the representations and warranties made by
such Purchaser to the Partnership in this Agreement. In addition, such
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (i) each of the Placement Agents is
acting solely as a placement agent in connection with the private
placement by the Partnership of the Common Units contemplated hereunder and
is not acting as an underwriter or in any other capacity and is not and shall
not be construed as a fiduciary for any Purchaser, the Partnership or any
other person or entity in connection with the transactions set forth
hereunder, (ii) none of the Placement Agents has made and will not make any
representations, declarations or warranties, whether express or implied, of
any kind or character and has not provided any advice or recommendation to
such Purchaser regarding the Partnership or its offering of the Common Units;
(iii) such Purchaser, in making its investment decision with respect to
whether to invest in the Common Units offered by the Partnership hereunder
has relied on its own analysis and decision, and has not relied on any of the
Placement Agents or their respective representatives for any purpose; and (iv)
none of the Placement Agents has offered to sell, or solicited an offer
to buy, any of the Common Units, which such Purchaser proposes to acquire
from the Partnership. Such Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that (A)
except for the representations, warranties and agreements of the Partnership
expressly set forth in the Purchase Agreement, such Purchaser is relying
exclusively on its own sources of information, investment analysis and due
diligence (including professional advice such Purchaser deems appropriate)
with respect to the Purchased Units, the transactions contemplated hereunder
and the business, condition (financial and otherwise), management, operations,
properties and prospects of the Partnership, including but not limited to all
business, legal, regulatory, accounting, credit and tax matters, (B) no
Placement Agent shall have responsibility with respect to (i) any
representations, warranties or agreements made by any person or entity under
or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder or any of
the documents furnished pursuant thereto or in connection therewith, or the
execution, legality, validity or enforceability (with respect to any person)
or any thereof, or (ii) the business, affairs, financial condition,
operations, properties or prospects of, or any other matter concerning the
Partnership or the transactions contemplated hereunder, and (C) no Placement
Agent shall have any liability or obligation (including without limitation,
for or with respect to any losses, claims, damages, obligations, penalties,
judgments, awards, liabilities, costs, expenses or disbursements incurred by
such Purchaser, the Partnership or any other person or entity), whether in
contract, tort or otherwise, to such Purchaser, or to any person claiming
through such Purchaser, in respect of the transactions contemplated hereunder.

Section 4.12 _Short Selling_. Such Purchaser represents that it has not
entered into any Short Sales of the Common Units owned by it since the time it
first began discussions with the Partnership or the Placement Agents about the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;  _provided, however_ , subject
to such Purchasers compliance with its obligations under the U.S.

 



33

    

 federal securities laws and its internal policies, the above shall not
apply, in the case of a Purchaser that is a large multi-unit investment or
commercial banking organization, to activities in the normal course of
trading units of such Purchaser; _provided, further_ , that subject to such
Purchasers compliance with its obligations under the U.S. federal securities
laws and its internal policies: (a) such Purchaser, for purposes hereof,
shall not be deemed to include any employees, subsidiaries or Affiliates that
are effectively walled off by appropriate "Chinese Wall" information barriers
approved by such Purchasers legal or compliance department (and thus have
not been privy to any information concerning this transaction) (a " _Walled
Off Person_ ") and (b) the foregoing representations in this paragraph shall
not apply to any transaction by or on behalf of such Purchaser that was
effected by a Walled Off Person in the ordinary course of trading without the
advice or participation of such Purchaser or receipt of confidential or other
information regarding this transaction provided by such Purchaser to such
entity. 

ARTICLE V

 

COVENANTS

 

Section 5.1 _Taking of Necessary Action_. Each of the parties hereto shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts promptly to take or cause to be taken all
action and promptly to do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law and regulations to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Partnership and each Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make all filings and obtain all Consents of
Governmental Authorities that may be necessary or, in the reasonable opinion
of the other parties, as the case may be, advisable for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents; _provided_ ,
_however_ , and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, that no Purchaser is
under any obligation by reason of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ to make, seek or
receive any filings, notifications, consents, determinations, authorizations,
permits, approvals, licenses or the like with or provide any documentation or
information to any regulatory or self-regulatory body having jurisdiction
over the Partnership or Purchaser other than information that is already
included in this Agreement or is otherwise in the public domain other than as
may be requested by the Commission or pursuant to any applicable securities
or "Blue Sky" laws of the United States. The Partnership shall promptly and
accurately respond, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its transfer agent to respond, to reasonable requests for information (which
is otherwise not publicly available) made by a Purchaser or its auditors
relating to the actual holdings of such Purchaser or its accounts; _provided_
, that the Partnership shall not be obligated to provide any such information
that could reasonably result in a violation of applicable Law or conflict with
the Partnerships insider trading policy or a confidentiality obligation of
the Partnership. The Partnership shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its transfer agent to reasonably cooperate with
each Purchaser to ensure that the Purchased Units are validly and effectively
issued to such Purchaser and that such Purchasers ownership of the Purchased
Units following the Closing is accurately reflected on the appropriate books
and records of the Partnerships transfer agent.

Section 5.2 _Other Actions_. The Partnership shall file prior to the Closing
a supplemental listing application with the NYSE to list the Purchased Units.

 



34

    

Section 5.3 _Expenses_. The Partnership shall pay up to $75,000 of legal fees
of reasonably acceptable counsel to certain of the Purchasers, incurred in
connection with the negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, _provided_ that any request for such payment
is accompanied by a satisfactory written invoice for such expenses. If any
action at law or equity is necessary to enforce or interpret the terms of any
Operative Document, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reasonable
attorneys fees, costs and necessary disbursements in addition to any other
relief to which such party may be entitled.

 

Section 5.4 _Non-Public Information_. On or before 8:30 a.m., New York local
time, on the Business Day immediately following the date hereof, the
Partnership shall issue a press release (the " _Press Release_ ") announcing
the entry into this Agreement and describing the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and any other material, nonpublic information
that the Partnership may have provided any Purchaser at any time prior to the
issuance of the Press Release. On or before the fourth Business Day following
the date hereof, the Partnership shall file a Current Report on Form 8-K with
the Commission describing the terms of the transactions contemplated by the
Operative Documents, and including as an exhibit to such Current Report on
Form 8-K the Operative Documents, in the form required by the Exchange Act.

Section 5.5 _Use of Proceeds_. The Partnership shall use the net proceeds
from the sale of the Purchased Units (after the payment of all related fees
and expenses, including commissions and reimbursement of expenses to the
Placement Agents) to fund a portion of the Cash Consideration for the
Contribution.

ARTICLE VI

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

Section 6.1 _Indemnification by the Partnership_. The Partnership agrees to
indemnify each Purchaser and its Representatives (collectively, " _Purchaser
Related Parties_ ") from, and hold each of them harmless against, any and all
actions, suits, proceedings (including any investigations, litigation or
inquiries), demands, and causes of action, and, in connection therewith, and
promptly upon demand, pay or reimburse each of them for all costs, losses,
liabilities, damages, or expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever, including,
without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and all
other reasonable expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending
or preparing to defend any such matter that may be incurred by them or
asserted against or involve any of them as a result of, arising out of, or in
any way related to the breach of any of the representations, warranties or
covenants of the Partnership contained herein, _provided_ that such claim for
indemnification relating to a breach of the representations or warranties is
made prior to the expiration of the survival period for such representations
or warranties; and _provided further_ , that no Purchaser Related Party shall
be entitled to recover special, consequential (including lost profits) or
punitive damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, consequential
damages shall not be deemed to include diminution in value of the Purchased
Units, which is specifically included in damages covered by Purchaser Related
Parties indemnification above.

 

Section 6.2 _Indemnification Procedure_. Promptly after receipt by an
indemnified party under this  _Article_ __ _ VI_ of notice of any claim or
the commencement of any action, the indemnified party shall, if a claim in
respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this
_Article_ __ _ VI_, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim or
the commencement of that action; _provided, however_ , that the failure to
notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from

 



35

    

 any liability which it may have under _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ of this _Article_
__ _ VI_ except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced (through
the forfeiture of substantive rights and defenses) by such failure and,
_provided, further_ , that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall
not relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party
otherwise than under this _Article_ __ _ VI_. If any such claim or action
shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the
indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other
similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from
the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the
defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to
the indemnified party under this _Article_ __ _ VI_ for any legal or other
expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with
the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; _provided,
however_ , that the indemnified party shall have the right to employ counsel
to represent jointly the indemnified party and those other indemnified
parties and their respective directors, officers, employees and controlling
persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of
which indemnity may be sought under this _Article_ __ _ VI_ if (a) the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party shall have so mutually agreed;
(b) the indemnifying party has failed within a reasonable time to retain
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party; (c) the
indemnified party and its directors, officers, employees and controlling
persons shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses
available to them that are different from or in addition to those available to
the indemnifying party; or (d) the named parties in any such proceeding
(including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnified parties or
their respective directors, officers, employees or controlling persons, on the
one hand, and the indemnifying party, on the other hand, and representation
of both sets of parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to
actual or potential differing interests between them, and in any such event
the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by
the indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall (i) without the prior
written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or
proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought
hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential
parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all
liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding and does not
include a statement as to, or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure
to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party, or (ii) be liable for any
settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but if settled with the consent
of the indemnifying party or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff
in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by
reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an
indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of
counsel to the extent required by  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ hereof, the
indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any
proceeding effected without its written consent if (x) such settlement is
entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of
the aforesaid request and (y) such indemnifying party shall not have
reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request or disputed
in good faith the indemnified partys entitlement to such reimbursement prior
to the date of such settlement.

Section 7.3 _No Waiver; Modifications in Writing_.

 

(a) _Delay_. No failure or delay on the part of any party in exercising any
right, power, or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor

by the Partnership).

 

Section 7.5 _Confidentiality_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, to the extent that any Purchaser has executed or is otherwise bound
by a confidentiality agreement in favor of the Partnership, such Purchaser
shall continue to be bound by such confidentiality agreement in accordance
with the terms thereof.

 

Section 7.6 _Communications_. All notices and demands provided for hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be given by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, electronic mail, air courier guaranteeing overnight
delivery or personal delivery to the following addresses:

 

(a) If to any Purchaser, to the respective address listed on _Schedule A_ to
the Registration Rights Agreement; and

 

(b) If to the Partnership:

Suite 2500 

Houston, Texas 77002

 

Attention: Ramey Layne

 

Email: 

or to such other address as the Partnership or such Purchaser may designate
in writing. All notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly
given: at the time delivered by hand, if personally delivered; at the time of
transmittal, if sent via electronic mail; upon actual receipt if sent by
certified mail, return receipt requested, or regular mail, if mailed; when
receipt acknowledged, if sent via facsimile; and upon actual receipt when
delivered to an air courier guaranteeing overnight delivery.

Section 7.7 _Removal of Legend_. The Partnership, at its sole cost, shall
remove the legend described in Section 4.9 (or instruct its transfer agent to
so remove such legend) from the certificates evidencing Purchased Units issued
and sold to each Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement if (a) such Purchased
Units are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act, (b) such Purchased Units are sold or transferred pursuant to
Rule 144 (if the transferor is not an Affiliate of the Partnership), or (c)
such Purchased Units are eligible for sale under Rule 144, without the
requirement for the Partnership to be in compliance with the current public
information required under Rule 144(c)(1) (or Rule 144(i)(2), if applicable)
as to such securities and without volume or manner of sale restrictions. In
connection with a sale of the Purchased Units by a Purchaser in reliance on
Rule 144, the applicable Purchaser shall deliver to the transfer agent and the
Partnership a customary representation letter providing to the transfer
agent and the Partnership any information the Partnership deems reasonably
necessary to determine that the sale of the Purchased Units is made in
compliance with Rule 144, including, as may be appropriate, a certification
that the Purchaser is not an Affiliate of the Partnership and regarding the
length of time the Purchased Units have been held. Upon receipt of such
representation letter, the Partnership shall promptly direct its transfer
agent to remove the legend referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 4.9_ from the
appropriate book-entry accounts maintained by the transfer agent, and the
Partnership shall bear all costs associated therewith. After any Purchaser or
its permitted assigns have held the Purchased Units for such time as non-
Affiliates are permitted to sell without volume limitations under Rule 144, if
the certificate for such Purchased Units still bears the restrictive legend
referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 4.9_, the Partnership agrees, upon request of
the Purchaser or permitted assignee, to take all steps necessary to promptly
effect the removal of the legend described in _Section_ __ _ 4.9_ from
the Purchased Units, and the Partnership shall bear all costs associated
therewith, regardless of whether the request is made in connection with a sale
or otherwise, so long as such Purchaser or its permitted assigns provide to
the Partnership any information the Partnership deems reasonably necessary to
determine that the legend is no longer required under the Securities Act or
applicable state laws, including a certification that the holder is not an
Affiliate of the Partnership (and a covenant to inform the Partnership if it
should thereafter become an Affiliate and to consent to exchange its
certificates for certificates bearing an appropriate restrictive legend) and
regarding the length of time the Purchased Units have been held.

and the other agreements and documents referred to herein are intended by the
parties as a final expression of their agreement and intended to be a complete
and exclusive statement of the agreement and understanding of the parties
hereto in respect of the subject matter contained herein and therein. There
are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties or undertakings,
other than those set forth or referred to herein or the other Operative
Documents with respect to the rights granted by the Partnership or any of its

any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which counterparts, when so executed and delivered,
shall be deemed to be an original and all of which counterparts, taken
together, shall constitute but one and the same Agreement. In the event that

a ".pdf" format data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding
obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is
executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or ".pdf"
signature page were an original thereof.

 

Section 7.11 _Termination_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement may be
terminated at any time at or prior to the Closing by any Purchaser (with
respect to such Purchaser only), upon a breach in any material respect by the
Partnership of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement shall
automatically terminate at any time at or prior to the Closing if a statute,
rule, order, decree or regulation shall have been enacted or promulgated, or
if any action shall have been taken by any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction that permanently restrains, permanently precludes, permanently
enjoins or otherwise permanently prohibits the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or makes the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement illegal.

 

(c) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.11_, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void.
In the event of such termination, there shall be no liability on the part of
any party hereto, except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and _Article_ __
_ VI_ of this Agreement.

of assets or otherwise) which may be issued in respect of, in exchange for or
in substitution of, the Common Units, and shall be appropriately adjusted for
combinations, unit splits, recapitalizations and the like occurring after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing.

on a firm commitment basis for reoffering to the public or an offering that is
a "bought deal" with one or more investment banks. 

Section 8.2 _Registrable Securities_. Any Registrable Security will cease to
be a Registrable Security (a) when a registration statement covering such
Registrable Security becomes or has been declared effective by the Commission
and such Registrable Security has been sold or disposed of pursuant to such
effective registration statement; (b) when such Registrable Security has been
disposed of (excluding transfers or assignments by a Holder to an Affiliate)
pursuant to any section of Rule 144 (or any similar provision then in effect)
under the Securities Act; (c) when such Registrable Security is held by the
Partnership or one of its subsidiaries or Affiliates; (d) when such
Registrable Security has been sold or disposed of in a private transaction in
which the transferors rights under this Agreement are not assigned to the
transferee of such securities pursuant to _Section 2.11_ hereof or (e) when
such Registrable Security becomes eligible for resale without restriction and
without the need for current public information pursuant to any section of
Rule 144 (or any similar provision then in effect) under the Securities Act.

ARTICLE IX

 

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

 

Section 9.1 _Registration_.

 

(a) _Effectiveness Deadline_. Following the date hereof, but no later than 30
days following the Closing Date, the Partnership shall prepare and file a
registration statement under the Securities Act to permit the public resale of
Registrable Securities then outstanding from time to time as permitted by Rule
415 (or any similar provision then in effect) under the Securities Act with
respect to all of the Registrable Securities (the " _Registration Statement_
"). The Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 2.01(a)_
shall be on such appropriate registration form or forms of the Commission as
shall be selected by the Partnership so long as it permits the continuous
offering of the Registrable Securities pursuant to Rule 415 (or any similar
provision then in effect) under the Securities Act at then-prevailing market
prices. The Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Registration Statement to become

 



Exhibit A to Common Unit Purchase Agreement

4

    

 effective on or as soon as practicable after the filing thereof. Any
Registration Statement shall provide for the resale pursuant to any method or
combination of methods legally available to, and requested by, the Holders of
any and all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement. The
Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Registration Statement filed pursuant to this _Section 2.01(a)_ to be
effective, supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that it
is available for the resale of all Registrable Securities by the Holders until
all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement have ceased
to be Registrable Securities (the " _Effectiveness Period_ "). The
Registration Statement when effective (including the documents incorporated
therein by reference) will comply as to form in all material respects with
all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any prospectus
contained in such Registration Statement or documents incorporated therein by
reference, in the light of the circumstances under which a statement is made).
As soon as practicable following the date that the Registration Statement
becomes effective, but in any event within two (2) Business Days of such date,
the Partnership shall provide the Holders with written notice of the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement. 

(b) _Failure to Go Effective_. If the Registration Statement required by
_Section 2.01(a)_ is not declared effective within 90 days after the Closing
Date, then each Holder shall be entitled to a payment (with respect to the
Purchased Units of each such Holder), as liquidated damages and not as a
penalty, of 0.25% of the Liquidated Damages Multiplier per 30-day period,
that shall accrue daily, for the first 30 days following the 90th day,
increasing by an additional 0.25% of the Liquidated Damages Multiplier per
30-day period, that shall accrue daily, for each subsequent 30 days, up to a
maximum of 1.00% of the Liquidated Damages Multiplier per 30-day period
(the " _Liquidated Damages_ "). The Liquidated Damages payable pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence shall be payable within ten (10) Business
Days after the end of each such 30-day period. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the aggregate of all
Liquidated Damages payable by the Partnership hereunder exceed 5.00% of the
Aggregate Purchase Price. Any Liquidated Damages shall be paid to each Holder
in immediately available funds; _provided_ , _however_ , if the Partnership
certifies that it is unable to pay Liquidated Damages in cash because such
payment would result in a breach of or constitute a default under a credit
facility or other debt instrument, then the Partnership shall pay such
Liquidated Damages using as much cash as is permitted without causing a breach
of or default under such credit facility or other debt instrument and may pay
the balance of any such Liquidated Damages in kind in the form of the issuance
of additional Common Units. Upon any issuance of Common Units as Liquidated
Damages, the Partnership shall promptly (i) prepare and file an amendment to
the Registration Statement prior to its effectiveness adding such Common Units
to such Registration Statement as additional Registrable Securities and (ii)
prepare and file a supplemental listing application with the NYSE (or such
other national securities exchange on which the Common Units are then-listed
and traded) to list such additional Common Units. The determination of the
number of Common Units to be issued as Liquidated Damages shall be equal to
the quotient of (i) the dollar amount of the balance of such Liquidated
Damages due to each such Holder and (ii) the volume-weighted average closing
price of the Common Units on the NYSE, or any other national securities
exchange on which the Common Units are then-traded, for the ten (10) trading
days ending on the first trading day immediately preceding the date on which
the Liquidated Damages payment is due, less a discount to such average closing
price of 2.00%. The payment of Liquidated Damages to a Holder shall cease at
the earlier of (i) the Registration Statement becoming effective or (ii) when
such Holder no longer holds Registrable Securities, assuming that each Holder
is not an Affiliate of the Partnership, and any payment of Liquidated

 



Exhibit A to Common Unit Purchase Agreement

5

    

 Damages shall be prorated for any period of less than 30 days in which the
payment of Liquidated Damages ceases. If the Partnership is unable to cause a
Registration Statement to go effective within 90 days after the Closing Date
as a result of an acquisition, merger, reorganization, disposition or other
similar transaction, then the Partnership may request a waiver of the
Liquidated Damages, and each Holder may individually grant or withhold its
consent to such request in its discretion.

(c) _Termination of Holder s Rights_. A Holders rights under this _Section_
__ _ 2.01_ shall terminate upon the termination of the Effectiveness Period.

 

Section 9.2 _Piggyback Rights_.

 

(a) _Participation_. If the Partnership proposes to file (i) a shelf
registration statement other than the Registration Statement contemplated by
_Section 2.01(a)_, (ii) a prospectus supplement to an effective shelf
registration statement, other than the Registration Statement contemplated by
_Section 2.01(a)_ of this Agreement and Holders may be included without the
filing of a post-effective amendment thereto, or (iii) a registration
statement, other than a shelf registration statement, in each case, for the
sale of Common Units in an Underwritten Offering for its own account and/or
another Person, then as soon as practicable following the engagement of
counsel by the Partnership to prepare the documents to be used in connection
with an Underwritten Offering, the Partnership shall give notice (including,
but not limited to, notification by electronic mail) of such proposed
Underwritten Offering to each Holder (together with its Affiliates) holding at
least $50 million of the then-outstanding Registrable Securities (based on the
Common Unit Price) and such notice shall offer such Holders the opportunity
to include in such Underwritten Offering such number of Registrable Securities
(the " _Included Registrable Securities_ ") as each such Holder may request in
writing;  _provided, however_ , that if the Partnership has been advised by
the Managing Underwriter that the inclusion of Registrable Securities for sale
for the benefit of the Holders will have an adverse effect on the price,
timing or distribution of the Common Units in the Underwritten Offering, then
(A) if no Registrable Securities can be included in the Underwritten Offering
in the opinion of the Managing Underwriter, the Partnership shall not be
required to offer such opportunity to the Holders or (B) if any Registrable
Securities can be included in the Underwritten Offering in the opinion of the
Managing Underwriter, then the amount of Registrable Securities to be offered
for the accounts of Holders shall be determined based on the provisions of
_Section 2.02(b)_. Any notice required to be provided in this _Section
2.02(a)_ to Holders shall be provided on a Business Day pursuant to _Section
3.01_ hereof and receipt of such notice shall be confirmed and kept
confidential by the Holder until such proposed Underwritten Offering is (i)
publicly announced or (ii) such Holder receives notice that such proposed
Underwritten Offering has been abandoned, which such notice shall be provided
promptly by the Partnership to each Holder. Each such Holder shall then have
two (2) Business Days (or one (1) Business Day in connection with any
overnight or bought Underwritten Offering) after notice has been delivered to
request in writing the inclusion of Registrable Securities in the Underwritten
Offering. If no written request for inclusion from a Holder is received within
the specified time, each such Holder shall have no further right
to participate in such Underwritten Offering. If, at any time after giving
written notice of its intention to undertake an Underwritten Offering and
prior to the closing of such Underwritten Offering, the Partnership shall
determine for any reason not to undertake or to delay such Underwritten
Offering, the Partnership may, at its election, give written notice of such
determination to the Selling Holders and, (x) in the case of a determination
not to

 



Exhibit A to Common Unit Purchase Agreement

6

    

 undertake such Underwritten Offering, shall be relieved of its obligation to
sell any Included Registrable Securities in connection with such terminated
Underwritten Offering, and (y) in the case of a determination to delay such
Underwritten Offering, shall be permitted to delay offering any Included
Registrable Securities for the same period as the delay in the Underwritten
Offering. Any Selling Holder shall have the right to withdraw such Selling
Holders request for inclusion of such Selling Holders Registrable Securities
in such Underwritten Offering by giving written notice to the Partnership of
such withdrawal at or prior to the time of pricing of such Underwritten
Offering. Any Holder may deliver written notice (an " _Opt-Out Notice_") to
the Partnership requesting that such Holder not receive notice from the
Partnership of any proposed Underwritten Offering; _provided, however_ , that
such Holder may later revoke any such Opt-Out Notice in writing. Following
receipt of an Opt-Out Notice from a Holder (unless subsequently revoked), the
Partnership shall not be required to deliver any notice to such Holder
pursuant to this _Section 2.02(a)_ and such Holder shall no longer be
entitled to participate in Underwritten Offerings by the Partnership pursuant
to this _Section 2.02(a)_. The Holders indicated on _Schedule_ __ _ A_
hereto as having opted out shall each be deemed to have delivered an Opt-
Out Notice as of the date hereof.

(b) _Priority_. If the Managing Underwriter or Underwriters of any proposed
Underwritten Offering advises the Partnership that the total amount of
Registrable Securities that the Selling Holders and any other Persons intend
to include in such offering exceeds the number that can be sold in such
offering without being likely to have an adverse effect on the price, timing
or distribution of the Common Units offered or the market for the Common
Units, then the Common Units to be included in such Underwritten Offering
shall include the number of Registrable Securities that such Managing
Underwriter or Underwriters advises the Partnership can be sold without having
such adverse effect, with such number to be allocated (i) first, to the
Partnership and (ii) second, pro rata among the Selling Holders who
have requested participation in such Underwritten Offering and, except as
provided in _clause_ __ _ (b)_, any other holder of securities of the
Partnership having rights of registration that are neither expressly senior
nor subordinated to the Registrable Securities (the " _Parity Securities_ ").
The pro rata allocations for each Selling Holder who has requested
participation in such Underwritten Offering shall be the product of (a) the
aggregate number of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold in such
Underwritten Offering multiplied by (b) the fraction derived by dividing (x)
the number of Registrable Securities owned on the Closing Date by such Selling
Holder by (y) the aggregate number of Registrable Securities owned on the
Closing Date by all Selling Holders plus the aggregate number of Parity
Securities owned on the Closing Date by all holders of Parity Securities that
are participating in the Underwritten Offering.

 

(c) _Termination of Piggyback Registration Rights_. Each Holders rights under
this _Section 2.02_ shall terminate upon such Holder (together with its
Affiliates) ceasing to hold at least $50 million of Registrable Securities
(based on the Common Unit Price). Each Holder shall notify the Partnership in
writing when such Holder holds less than $50 million of Registrable
Securities (based on the Common Unit Price).

 



Exhibit A to Common Unit Purchase Agreement

Section 9.3 _Delay Rights_.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Partnership
may, upon written notice to any Selling Holder whose Registrable Securities
are included in the Registration Statement or other registration statement
contemplated by this Agreement, suspend such Selling Holders use of any
prospectus which is a part of the Registration Statement or other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement (in which event the
Selling Holder shall discontinue sales of the Registrable Securities pursuant
to the Registration Statement or such other registration statement
contemplated by this Agreement but may settle any previously made sales of
Registrable Securities) if (i) the Partnership is pursuing an acquisition,
merger, reorganization, disposition, financing or other similar transaction
and the Partnership determines in good faith that the Partnerships ability
to pursue or consummate such a transaction would be materially adversely
affected by any required disclosure of such transaction in the Registration
Statement or such other registration statement or (ii) the Partnership has
experienced some other material non-public event, the disclosure of which at
such time, in the good faith judgment of the Partnership, would materially
adversely affect the Partnership;  _provided, however_ , in no event shall
the Selling Holders be suspended from selling Registrable Securities pursuant
to the Registration Statement or such other registration statement for a
period that exceeds an aggregate of 60 days in any 180-day period or 105 days
in any 365-day period, in each case, exclusive of days covered by any lock-up
agreement executed by a Selling Holder in connection with any Underwritten
Offering. Upon disclosure of such information or the termination of the
condition described above, the Partnership shall provide prompt notice to the
Selling Holders whose Registrable Securities are included in the Registration
Statement or other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement, and
shall promptly terminate any suspension of sales it has put into effect and
shall take such other reasonable actions to permit registered sales of
Registrable Securities as contemplated in this Agreement.

Section 9.4 _Underwritten Offerings_.

 

(a) _General Procedures_. In connection with any Underwritten Offering under
this Agreement, the Partnership shall be entitled to select the Managing
Underwriter or Underwriters. In connection with an Underwritten Offering
contemplated by this Agreement in which a Selling Holder participates, each
Selling Holder and the Partnership shall be obligated to enter into
an underwriting agreement that contains such representations, covenants,
indemnities and other rights and obligations as are customary in underwriting
agreements for firm commitment offerings of securities. No Selling Holder may
participate in such Underwritten Offering unless such Selling Holder agrees
to sell its Registrable Securities on the basis provided in such underwriting
agreement and completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney,
indemnities and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such
underwriting agreement. Each Selling Holder may, at its option, require that
any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements
on the part of, the Partnership to and for the benefit of such underwriters
also be made to and for such Selling Holders benefit and that any or all of
the conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such
underwriting agreement also be conditions precedent to its obligations. No
Selling Holder shall be required to make any representations or warranties to
or agreements with the Partnership or the underwriters other than
representations, warranties or agreements regarding such Selling Holder, its
authority to enter into such underwriting agreement and to sell, and its
ownership of, the securities being registered on its behalf, its intended
method of distribution and any other representation required by Law. If any
Selling Holder disapproves of the terms of an underwriting, such Selling
Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by notice to the Partnership and the
Managing Underwriter; _provided, however_ , that such withdrawal must be made
up to and including the time of pricing of such Underwritten Offering. No
such withdrawal or abandonment shall affect the Partnerships obligation to
pay Registration Expenses. The Partnerships management may but shall not be
required to participate in a roadshow or similar marketing effort in
connection with any Underwritten Offering.

 



Exhibit A to Common Unit Purchase Agreement

(b) _No Demand Rights_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no Holder shall be entitled to any "demand" rights or similar
rights that would require the Partnership to effect an Underwritten Offering
solely on behalf of the Holders.

 

Section 9.5 _Sale Procedures_. In connection with its obligations under this
_Article II_, the Partnership will, as expeditiously as possible:

(a) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to
the Registration Statement and the prospectus and any prospectus supplement
used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep the Registration
Statement effective for the Effectiveness Period and as may be necessary to
comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by the Registration
Statement;

(b) if a prospectus or prospectus supplement will be used in connection with
the marketing of an Underwritten Offering from the Registration Statement and
any Managing Underwriter at any time shall notify the Partnership in writing
that, in the sole judgment of such Managing Underwriter, inclusion of
detailed information to be used in such prospectus or prospectus supplement is
of material importance to the success of the Underwritten Offering of such
Registrable Securities, the Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to include such information in such prospectus or prospectus
supplement;

(c) furnish to each Selling Holder (i) as far in advance as reasonably
practicable before filing the Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement or any supplement or amendment
thereto, upon request, copies of reasonably complete drafts of all such
documents proposed to be filed (including exhibits and each document
incorporated by reference therein to the extent then required by the rules and
regulations of the Commission), and provide each such Selling Holder the
opportunity to object to any information pertaining to such Selling Holder
and its plan of distribution that is contained therein and make the
corrections reasonably requested by such Selling Holder with respect to such
information prior to filing the Registration Statement or such other
registration statement or supplement or amendment thereto, and (ii) such
number of copies of the Registration Statement or such other registration
statement and the prospectus and any prospectus supplement included therein
and any supplements and amendments thereto as such Selling Holder may
reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other disposition
of the Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement or other
registration statement;

(d) if applicable, use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or
qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement or
any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement under the
securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Selling Holders or,
in the case of an Underwritten Offering, the Managing Underwriter,
shall reasonably request; _provided, however_ , that the Partnership will not
be required to qualify generally to transact business in any jurisdiction
where it is not then required to so qualify or to take any action that would
subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is
not then so subject;

 



Exhibit A to Common Unit Purchase Agreement

9

    

(e) promptly notify each Selling Holder, at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered by any of them under the
Securities Act, of (i) the filing of the Registration Statement or any other
registration statement contemplated by this Agreement or any prospectus or
prospectus supplement to be used in connection therewith, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, and, with respect to such Registration Statement or any
such other registration statement or any post-effective amendment thereto,
when the same has become effective; and (ii) the receipt of any written
comments from the Commission with respect to any filing referred to in
_clause_ __ _ (e)_ and any written request by the Commission for amendments
or supplements to the Registration Statement or any such other registration
statement or any prospectus or prospectus supplement thereto;

(f) promptly notify each Selling Holder of (i) the happening of any event as
a result of which the prospectus or prospectus supplement contained in the
Registration Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by
this Agreement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material
fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any
prospectus or prospectus supplement contained therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which such statement is made); (ii) the issuance or
express threat of issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement, or the initiation of any
proceedings for that purpose; or (iii) the receipt by the Partnership of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of any
Registrable Securities for sale under the applicable securities or blue sky
laws of any jurisdiction. Following the provision of such notice, the
Partnership agrees, subject to _Section 2.03_ of this Agreement, to as
promptly as practicable amend or supplement the prospectus or prospectus
supplement or take other appropriate action so that the prospectus or
prospectus supplement does not include an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances
then existing and to take such other commercially reasonable action as is
necessary to remove a stop order, suspension, threat thereof or proceedings
related thereto;

 

(g) upon request and subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations,
furnish to each Selling Holder copies of any and all transmittal letters or
other correspondence with the Commission or any other governmental agency or
self-regulatory body or other body having jurisdiction (including any domestic
or foreign securities exchange) relating to such offering of
Registrable Securities;

(h) in the case of an Underwritten Offering, furnish upon request, (i) an
opinion of counsel for the Partnership dated the date of the closing under
the underwriting agreement and (ii) a "comfort" letter, dated the pricing date
of such Underwritten Offering and a letter of like kind dated the date of the
closing under the underwriting agreement, in each case, signed by the
independent public accountants who have certified the Partnerships financial
statements included or incorporated by reference into the applicable
registration statement, and each of the opinion and the "comfort" letter
shall be in customary form and covering substantially the same matters with
respect to such registration statement (and the prospectus and any prospectus
supplement included therein) as have been customarily covered in opinions of
issuers counsel and in accountants letters delivered to the underwriters in
Underwritten Offerings of securities by the Partnership and such other matters
as such underwriters and Selling Holders may reasonably request;

 



Exhibit A to Common Unit Purchase Agreement

10

    

(i) otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make available to its
security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement,
which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated thereunder;

(j) make available to the appropriate representatives of the Managing
Underwriter and Selling Holders access to such information and Partnership
personnel as is reasonable and customary to enable such parties to establish a
due diligence defense under the Securities Act; _provided_ , that the
Partnership need not disclose any non-public information to any such
representative unless and until such representative has entered into a
confidentiality agreement with the Partnership;

 

(k) cause all such Registrable Securities registered pursuant to this
Agreement to be listed on each securities exchange or nationally recognized
quotation system on which similar securities issued by the Partnership are
then listed;

(l) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable
Securities to be registered with or approved by such other governmental
agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and
operations of the Partnership to enable the Selling Holders to consummate the
disposition of such Registrable Securities;

(m) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable
Securities covered by such registration statement not later than the
effective date of such registration statement;

(n) enter into customary agreements and take such other actions as are
reasonably requested by the Selling Holders or the underwriters, if any, in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities; and

 

(o) if requested by a Selling Holder, (i) incorporate in a prospectus or
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to the Registration
Statement or any other registration statement contemplated by this Agreement
such information as such Selling Holder reasonably requests to be included
therein relating to the sale and distribution of Registrable Securities,
including information with respect to the number of Registrable Securities
being offered or sold, the purchase price being paid therefor and any other
terms of the offering of the Registrable Securities to be sold in such
offering and (ii) make all required filings of such prospectus or prospectus
supplement or post-effective amendment after being notified of the matters to
be incorporated in such prospectus or prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment.

 

The Partnership shall not name a Holder as an underwriter as defined in
Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act in any registration statement without
such Holders consent. If the staff of the Commission requires the Partnership
to name any Holder as an underwriter as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the
Securities Act, and such Holder does not consent thereto, then such Holders
Registrable Securities shall not be included on the Registration Statement (or
any other

 



Exhibit A to Common Unit Purchase Agreement

11

    

 registration statement contemplated by this Agreement), such Holder shall no
longer be entitled to receive Liquidated Damages under this Agreement with
respect thereto, the Partnership shall have no further obligations hereunder
with respect to Registrable Securities held by such Holder and such Holder
shall be deemed to have terminated this Agreement with respect to such Holder.

 

Each Selling Holder, upon receipt of notice from the Partnership of the
happening of any event of the kind described in  _subsection_ __ _ (f)_ of
this _Section 2.05_, shall forthwith discontinue offers and sales of the
Registrable Securities by means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement until
such Selling Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
prospectus or prospectus supplement contemplated by _subsection_ __ _ (f)_ of
this _Section 2.05_ or until it is advised in writing by the Partnership
that the use of the prospectus or prospectus supplement may be resumed and
has received copies of any additional or supplemental filings incorporated by
reference in the prospectus or prospectus supplement, and, if so directed by
the Partnership, such Selling Holder will, or will request the Managing
Underwriter(s), if any, to deliver to the Partnership (at the Partnerships
expense) all copies in their possession or control, other than permanent file
copies then in such Selling Holders possession, of the prospectus or
prospectus supplement covering such Registrable Securities current at the time
of receipt of such notice.

 

Section 9.6 _Cooperation by Holders_. The Partnership shall have no obligation
to include in the Registration Statement, or in an Underwritten Offering
pursuant to _ Section_ __ _ 2.02(a)_, Registrable Securities of a Holder who
has failed to timely furnish such information that the Partnership determines,
after consultation with its counsel, is reasonably required in order for the
registration statement or prospectus or prospectus supplement, as applicable,
to comply with the Securities Act.

 

Section 9.7 _Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable
Securities_. Each Holder of Registrable Securities agrees, if requested by
the underwriters of an Underwritten Offering, to enter into a customary letter
agreement with such underwriters providing such Holder will not effect any
public sale or distribution of Registrable Securities during the 60 calendar
day period beginning on the date of a prospectus or prospectus supplement
filed with the Commission with respect to the pricing of any Underwritten
Offering, _provided_ that (i) the duration of the foregoing restrictions shall
be no longer than the duration of the shortest restriction generally imposed
by the underwriters on the Partnership or the officers, directors or any other
Affiliate of the Partnership on whom a restriction is imposed and (ii) the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 2.07_ shall not apply to any
Registrable Securities that are included in such Underwritten Offering by such
Holder. In addition, this _Section 2.07_ shall not apply to any Holder that
is not entitled to participate in such Underwritten Offering, whether because
such Holder delivered an Opt-Out Notice prior to receiving notice of the
Underwritten Offering or because such Holder holds less than $50 million of
the then-outstanding Registrable Securities.

Section 9.8 _Expenses_.

 

(a) _Expenses_. The Partnership will pay all reasonable Registration Expenses
as determined in good faith, including, in the case of an Underwritten
Offering, whether or not any sale is made pursuant to such Underwritten
Offering. Each Selling Holder shall pay its pro rata share of all Selling
Expenses in connection with any sale of its Registrable Securities hereunder.
In addition, except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.09_ hereof, the
Partnership shall not be responsible for professional fees incurred by Holders
in connection with the exercise of such Holders rights hereunder.

 



Exhibit A to Common Unit Purchase Agreement

(b) _Certain Definitions_. " _Registration Expenses_ " means all expenses
incident to the Partnerships performance under or compliance with this
Agreement to effect the registration of Registrable Securities on the
Registration Statement pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_ or an
Underwritten Offering covered under this Agreement, and the disposition of
such Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, all registration,

any special audits or "comfort" letters required by or incident to such
performance and compliance. " _Selling Expenses_ " means all underwriting
fees, discounts and selling commissions or similar fees or arrangements
allocable to the sale of the Registrable Securities.

 

Section 9.9 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) _By the Partnership_. In the event of a registration of any Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the
Partnership will indemnify and hold harmless each Selling Holder thereunder,
its directors, officers, employees and agents and each Person, if any, who
controls such Selling Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act and
the Exchange Act, and its directors, officers, employees or agents
(collectively, the " _Selling Holder Indemnified Persons_ "), against any
losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) (collectively, " _Losses_ "), joint or several,
to which such Selling Holder Indemnified Person may become subject under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or
actions or proceedings, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof)
arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of any material fact (in the case of any prospectus or prospectus
supplement, in the light of the circumstances under which such statement is
made) contained in the Registration Statement or any other registration
statement contemplated by this Agreement, any preliminary prospectus,
preliminary prospectus supplement, free writing prospectus or final
prospectus or prospectus supplement contained therein, or any amendment or
supplement thereof, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus or
prospectus supplement, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made) not misleading, and will reimburse each such Selling Holder Indemnified
Person for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in
connection with investigating or defending any such Loss or actions or
proceedings; _provided, however_ , that the Partnership will not be liable in
any such case if and to the extent that any such Loss arises out of or is
based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission so made in conformity with information furnished by such
Selling Holder Indemnified Person in writing specifically for use in
the Registration Statement or such other registration statement contemplated
by this Agreement, any preliminary prospectus, preliminary prospectus
supplement, free writing prospectus, or final prospectus or prospectus
supplement contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereof. Such
indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of such Selling Holder Indemnified Person,
and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such Selling Holder.

 



Exhibit A to Common Unit Purchase Agreement

(b) _By Each Selling Holder_. Each Selling Holder agrees severally and
not jointly to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership, the General
Partner, its directors, officers, employees and agents and each Person, if
any, who controls the Partnership within the meaning of the Securities Act or
of the Exchange Act, and its directors, officers, employees and agents, to
the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Partnership to the Selling
Holders, but only with respect to information regarding such Selling Holder
furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Selling Holder expressly for
inclusion in the Registration Statement or any other registration statement
contemplated by this Agreement, any preliminary prospectus, preliminary
prospectus supplement, free writing prospectus or final prospectus
or prospectus supplement contained therein, or any amendment or supplement
thereof; _provided, however_ , that the liability of each Selling Holder shall
not be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of any
Selling Expenses) received by such Selling Holder from the sale of the
Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification.

(c) _Notice_. Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of
notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing thereof, but the omission
so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability
that it may have to any indemnified party other than under this _Section
2.09_. In any action brought against any indemnified party, it shall notify
the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof. The indemnifying party
shall be entitled to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, to
assume and undertake the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to such indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to
such indemnified party of its election so to assume and undertake the defense
thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party
under this _Section 2.09_ for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by
such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than
reasonable costs of investigation and of liaison with counsel so selected;
_provided, however_ , that, (i) if the indemnifying party has failed to
assume the defense or employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnified
party or (ii) if the defendants in any such action include both the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party and counsel to the indemnified
party shall have concluded that there may be reasonable defenses available to
the indemnified party that are different from or additional to those available
to the indemnifying party, or if the interests of the indemnified party
reasonably may be deemed to conflict with the interests of the indemnifying
party, then the indemnified party shall have the right to select a separate
counsel and to assume such legal defense and otherwise to participate in the
defense of such action, with the reasonable expenses and fees of such separate
counsel and other reasonable expenses related to such participation to be
reimbursed by the indemnifying party as incurred. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, no indemnifying party shall settle any
action brought against any indemnified party with respect to which such
indemnified party is entitled to indemnification hereunder without the consent
of the indemnified party, unless the settlement thereof imposes no liability
or obligation on, and includes a complete and unconditional release from all
liability of, the indemnified party.

 



Exhibit A to Common Unit Purchase Agreement

(d) _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in this _Section
2.09_ is held by a court or government agency of competent jurisdiction to be
unavailable to any indemnified party or is insufficient to hold them harmless
in respect of any Losses, then each such indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such Loss in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party on
the one hand and of such indemnified party on the other in connection with
the statements or omissions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations; _provided, however_ , that in no event
shall such Selling Holder be required to contribute an aggregate amount in
excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of Selling Expenses) received by
such Selling Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities giving rise to
such indemnification. The relative fault of the indemnifying party on the one
hand and the indemnified party on the other shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
has been made by, or relates to, information supplied by such party, and the
parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto agree that
it would not be just and equitable if contributions pursuant to this paragraph
were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred
to herein. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the Losses
referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph shall be deemed to include
any legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with investigating or defending any Loss that is the subject of
this paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who is not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

(e) _Other Indemnification_. The provisions of this _Section 2.09_ shall be
in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution that an
indemnified party may have pursuant to law, equity, contract or otherwise.

 

Section 9.10 _Rule_ __ _ 144 Reporting_. With a view to making available the
benefits of certain rules and regulations of the Commission that may permit
the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, the
Partnership agrees to:

 

(a) use commercially reasonable efforts to make and keep public information
regarding the Partnership available, as those terms are understood and
defined in Rule 144 (or any similar provision then in effect) under the
Securities Act, at all times from and after the date hereof;

 

(b) use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the Commission in a
timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Partnership
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act at all times from and after the
date hereof; and

(c) so long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, furnish (i) to the
extent accurate, forthwith upon request, a written statement of the
Partnership that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144
(or any similar provision then in effect) under the Securities Act, and (ii)
unless otherwise available via EDGAR, to such Holder forthwith upon request a
copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Partnership, and
such other reports and documents so filed as such Holder may reasonably
request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the Commission
allowing such Holder to sell any such securities without registration.

Solely for purposes of this _Section 2.10_, the term
"Registrable Securities" shall be read without regard to the limitation set

Section 9.11 _Transfer or Assignment of Registration Rights_. The rights to
cause the Partnership to register Registrable Securities granted to the
Purchasers by the Partnership under this _Article II_ may be transferred or
assigned by any Purchaser to one or more transferees or assignees of
Registrable Securities; _provided, however,_ that (a) unless the transferee
or assignee is an Affiliate of, and after such transfer or assignment
continues to be an Affiliate of, such Purchaser, the amount of Registrable
Securities transferred or assigned to such transferee or assignee shall
represent at least $50 million of Registrable Securities (based on the Common
Unit Price), (b) the Partnership is given written notice prior to any said
transfer or assignment, stating the name and address of each such transferee
or assignee and identifying the securities with respect to which such
registration rights are being transferred or assigned, (c) each such
transferee or assignee assumes in writing responsibility for its portion of
the obligations of such Purchaser under this Agreement and (d) the transferor
or assignor is not relieved of any obligations or liabilities hereunder
arising out of events occurring prior to such transfer.

 

Section 9.12 _Limitation on Subsequent Registration Rights_. From and after
the date hereof, the Partnership shall not, without the prior written consent
of the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities, enter into any
agreement with any current or future holder of any securities of the
Partnership that would allow such current or future holder to require
the Partnership to include securities in any registration statement filed by
the Partnership on a basis other than _pari passu_ with, or expressly
subordinate to the rights of, the Holders of Registrable Securities hereunder.

EXHIBIT B

 

FORM OF OPINION OF VINSON and ELKINS LLP

 

Based on the foregoing, and subject to the qualifications and limitations set
forth herein, we are of the opinion that:

 



     | i. |

The Partnership is a limited partnership organized under the Delaware LP Act
with all limited partnership power and authority, as applicable, (i) to enter
into the Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement, to the
extent a party thereto, and to perform its obligations thereunder, and (ii) to
own its properties and to conduct its business as described in the SEC
Reports. We confirm that the Partnership is validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and is qualified to do
business as a foreign limited partnership in the states set forth opposite
its name on _Exhibit A_ hereto. 

---|---|--- 



     | ii. |

The General Partner is a limited liability company organized under the
Delaware LLC Act with all limited liability company power and authority to
own its properties, to conduct its business and to act as the general partner
of the Partnership, as applicable, as described in the SEC Reports. We confirm
that the General Partner is validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware and is qualified to do business as a foreign
limited liability company in the states set forth opposite its name on Exhibit
A hereto. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | i. |

The Units to be issued and sold by the Partnership pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement and the limited partner interests represented thereby have been
duly authorized in accordance with the Partnership Agreement and, when issued
and delivered by the Partnership against payment therefore in accordance with
the terms of the Purchase Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid (to
the extent required under the Partnership Agreement), nonassessable (except as
such nonassessability may be affected by Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804
of the Delaware LP Act) and free of preemptive rights arising from the
Partnership Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



     | ii. |

The execution, delivery and performance of the Purchase Agreement by the
Partnership have been duly authorized by all necessary limited partnership
action; and the Purchase Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Partnership. 

---|---|--- 



     | iii. |

The execution, delivery and performance of the Registration Rights Agreement
have been duly authorized by all necessary limited partnership action of the
Partnership, and the Registration Rights Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Partnership and is the legally valid and binding agreement of
the Partnership, enforceable against the Partnership in accordance with its
terms, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by (i) applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and (ii) public policy,
applicable law relating to fiduciary duties and indemnification and
implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing. 

---|---|--- 

Exhibit B to Common Unit Purchase Agreement

 



1

         | iv. |

As of the date hereof, the execution and delivery of the Operative Documents
by the Partnership, the offering, issuance and sale of the Units by the
Partnership to the Purchasers pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents do
not: 

---|---|--- 
 



     | a. |

violate the Certificate of Limited Partnership of the Partnership or the
Partnership Agreement;  

---|---|--- 



     | b. |

result in the breach of or a default under any material agreements filed as an
exhibit 10 to the Partnerships Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 19,
2019 and any subsequently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q; or 

---|---|--- 
 



     | c. |

violate any federal or New York statute, rule or regulation applicable to the
Partnership Entities or the Delaware LP Act or the Delaware LLC Act; or 

---|---|--- 



     | d. |

require any consents, approvals, or authorizations to be obtained by the
Partnership Entities from, or any registrations, declarations or filings to
be made by the Partnership Entities with, any governmental authority under any
federal or New York statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Partnership
Entities or the Delaware LP Act or the Delaware LLC Act on or prior to the
date hereof that have not been obtained or made; 

---|---|--- 

except in clauses (b), (c) and (d) above for any such breaches, defaults,
violations, consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations, declarations
or filings that, individually or in the aggregate, the occurrence of which or
the failure to have obtained have not materially impaired and will not
materially impair the ability of any of the Partnership Entities to consummate
the transactions provided for in the Operative Documents or would not
reasonably be expected to have a Partnership Material Adverse Effect;
provided, however, that we express no opinion in this paragraph (vi) with
respect to federal or state securities laws.



     | v. |

The Partnership is not and, immediately after giving effect to the issuance
and sale of the Units in accordance with the Purchase Agreement and the
application of the proceeds therefrom, it will not be, required to register as
an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | vi. |

Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each Purchaser
and the Partnership contained in the Purchase Agreement, the issuance and
sale of the Units pursuant to the Purchase Agreement are exempt from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We
express no opinion, however, as to when or under what circumstances you may
reoffer or resell any Units.

Private Placement by Noble Midstream Partners LP 

---|---|--- 
 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

The undersigned understands that Noble Midstream Partners LP, a Delaware
limited partnership (the " _Partnership_ ") has entered into a Common Unit
Purchase Agreement, dated as of November [ ], 2019 (the "
_Purchase Agreement_ "), with the purchasers party thereto providing for the
private placement of common units representing limited partner interests in
the Partnership (the " _Common Units_ ").

 

It is anticipated that in connection with the private placement, the
Partnership shall, following completion of the private placement, file
a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Registration Statement_ "), with respect to the possible resale, from time to
time, of the Common Units and that such Registration Statement will be filed
by the Partnership within the time period specified by, and the Partnership
will keep the Registration Statement effective until such time as may be
provided in, the definitive agreements entered into in connection with the
private placement of the Common Units.

In recognition of the benefit that such a private placement will confer upon
the undersigned, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the undersigned agrees with
each of BofA Securities, Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (together, the
" _Agents_ "), and each investor named in the Purchase Agreement that, during
the period beginning on the Closing Date (as defined in the Purchase
Agreement) and ending on the date that is [ ] days1 from
consummation of the purchase and sale of the Purchased Units (as defined in
the Purchase Agreement) (the " _Lock-Up Period_"), the undersigned will not,
without the prior written consent of the Agents, directly or indirectly, (i)
offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to
purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right or
warrant for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of or transfer any Common Units
or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common
Units, whether now owned or hereafter acquired by the undersigned or with
respect to which the undersigned has or hereafter acquires the power of
disposition (collectively, the " _Lock-Up Units_"), or exercise any right with
respect to the registration of any of the Lock-up Units, or file or cause to
be filed any registration statement in connection therewith, under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (other

 than pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement between the Partnership
and the purchasers, the form of which is attached to the Purchase Agreement),
or (ii) enter into any swap or any other agreement or any transaction that
transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, the economic
consequence of ownership of the Lock-Up Units, whether any such swap or
transaction is to be settled by delivery of Common Units or other securities,
in cash or otherwise.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to the conditions below, the
undersigned may transfer the Lock-Up Units without the prior written consent
of the Agents, provided that (i) the Agents receive a signed lock-
up agreement for the balance of the Lock-Up Period from each donee, trustee,
distributee or transferee, as the case may be, (ii) any such transfer shall
not involve a disposition for value, (iii) such transfers are not required to
be reported with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") on
Form 4 in accordance with Section 16 (" _Section_ __ _ 16_") of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and
(iv) the undersigned does not otherwise voluntarily effect any public filing
or report regarding such transfers:

 



     | (i) |

as a bona fide gift or gifts; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) |

to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the undersigned or the
immediate family of the undersigned (for purposes of this lock-up agreement,
"immediate family" shall mean any relationship by blood, marriage or adoption,
not more remote than first cousin); 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) |

as a distribution to limited partners or unitholders of the undersigned; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) |

to the undersigneds affiliates or to any investment fund or other entity
controlled or managed by the undersigned; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (v) |

any exercise of options or vesting or exercise of any other equity-based
award, in each case, outstanding on the date of this Lock-Up Agreement, and
in each case under the Partnerships equity incentive plan or any other plan
or agreement described in the prospectus included or incorporated by reference
in the Registration Statement, and the withholding of Common Units by the
Company for the payment of taxes due upon such exercise or vesting, provided
that any Common Units received upon such exercise or vesting will also be
subject to this Lock-Up Agreement. 

---|---|--- 

Furthermore, the restrictions in the third paragraph of this letter agreement
shall not apply to (i) the establishment of a trading plan pursuant to Rule
10b5-1 under the Exchange Act for the transfer of Common Units, provided that
(a) such plan does not provide for the transfer of Common Units during the
Lock-up Period and (b) to the extent a public announcement or filing under the
Exchange Act, if any, is required of or voluntarily made by or on behalf of
the undersigned or the Partnership regarding the establishment of such plan,
such announcement or filing shall include a statement to the effect that no
transfer of Common Units may be made under such plan during the Lock-up
Period, (ii) sales pursuant to any Rule 10b5-1 plan currently in effect on the
date hereof, (iii) existing pledges pursuant to loan or similar agreements
in effect on the date hereof, as amended from time to time, or any successor
to any such agreement, or any transfers pursuant to any such agreement, or
(iv) the deemed disposition of Common Units under Section 16 upon the cash
settlement of phantom units or unit appreciation rights outstanding as of the
date of this Agreement.

 



Exhibit C to Common Unit Purchase Agreement

Furthermore, the undersigned may sell Common Units of the Partnership
purchased by the undersigned on the open market following the private
placement if and only if (i) such sales are not required to be reported in any
public report or filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 4
in accordance with Section 16 and (ii) the undersigned does not otherwise
voluntarily effect any public filing or report regarding such sales.
