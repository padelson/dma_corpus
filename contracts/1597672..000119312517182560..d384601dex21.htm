This ARRANGEMENT AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of May 24, 2017,
is by and between Rayonier Advanced Materials Inc., a corporation organized
and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (" _Acquiror_ "), and
Tembec Inc., a corporation continued and existing under the laws of Canada ("

Agreement shall have the meaning set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.13_.

 

WHEREAS, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Acquiror would
acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Company (the " _Company
Common Shares_ "), in exchange for the issuance and payment of cash and shares
of common stock, par value U.S.$0.01 per share, of Acquiror (the " _Acquiror
Common Stock_ "), pursuant to a plan of arrangement, in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ (as amended from time to time in accordance with
this Agreement, the " _Plan of Arrangement_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously approved the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Plan of Arrangement, and Company has agreed, in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, to submit for approval (a) a special resolution in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (as amended from time to time in accordance
with this Agreement, the " _Arrangement Resolution_ "), to the holders of the
outstanding Company Common Shares and (b) the Plan of Arrangement to the
Superior Court of Quebec (the " _Court_ ");

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Acquiror (the " _Acquiror Board_ ") has
unanimously approved the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Plan of Arrangement, including, but not limited to, the issuance of Acquiror
Common Stock contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Share Issuance_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, certain officers
and directors of Company have entered into a support and voting agreement
with Acquiror, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D; and

WHEREAS, Acquiror and Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties and covenants in connection with, and to prescribe certain
conditions to, the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
intending to be legally bound, Acquiror and Company agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1 __

 

THE ARRANGEMENT

Section 1.1. _Effect of the Arrangement_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time and as more
fully set forth in the Plan of Arrangement:

 

(a) Each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time held by a shareholder of Company that has validly exercised
its Dissent Right in respect of the Arrangement will be transferred by such
shareholder to Acquiror. (b) Each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Company Common Shares owned, directly or
indirectly, by Acquiror and other than Company Common Shares with respect to
which Dissent Rights in respect of the Arrangement have been properly
exercised and not withdrawn) will be transferred by such shareholder to
Acquiror in exchange for (i) in the case of a Company Common Share with
respect to which an election to receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been
properly made and not lost pursuant to _Section 1.10_  (each, a " _Cash
Electing Share_ "), C$4.05 in cash without interest (the " _Per Share Cash
Amount_ "), or (ii) in the case of a Company Common Share with respect to
which an election to receive Acquiror Common Stock (a " _Share Election_ ")
has been properly made and not lost pursuant to _Section 1.10_ (each, a "
_Stock Electing Share_ "), 0.2302 (such ratio, as it may be adjusted pursuant
to _Section 1.9_ , the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable share of Acquiror Common Stock and, if applicable, cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock payable in accordance with
the Plan of Arrangement (the " _Per Share Stock Consideration_ "), in each
case subject to _Section 1.10(f)_ and _Section 1.10(g)_ (the consideration
payable in accordance with this _Section 1.1(b)_ , the " _Consideration_ ").
Any Company Common Share with respect to which neither a Share Election nor a
Cash Election has been properly made and not lost pursuant to _Section 1.10_
shall be deemed to be a Stock Electing Share.

 

(c) Each warrant to purchase Company Common Shares pursuant to the 2012 IQ
Loan Agreement and the 2013 IQ Loan Agreement (each, an " _IQ Warrant_ ")
that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) __ the excess, if any,
of the Consideration Cash Value _over_ the exercise price per Company Common
Share of such IQ Warrant, _multiplied by_ (ii) _ ___ the number of Company
Common Shares subject to such IQ Warrant as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _IQ Warrant Consideration_ "); _provided_ that any IQ
Warrant that has an exercise price per Company Common Share that equals or
exceeds the Consideration Cash Value shall be cancelled for no consideration.

(d) Each performance-conditioned share unit award, performance-conditioned
deferred share unit award and non-performance based deferred share unit award
granted under any Company Share-Based Plan (each, a " _Company DSU Award_ "),
whether vested or unvested, shall fully vest (to the extent not vested)
and shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the Consideration Cash Value in respect of
each Company Common Share underlying such Company DSU Award as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Acquiror shall pay the consideration described
in this _Section 1.1(d)_, less applicable tax withholdings, within five
Business Days following the Effective Date.

 

(e) If the Aggregate Share Consideration to be issued in connection with the
Arrangement would exceed the Maximum Share Number, the Cash Consideration
Number for all purposes under this Agreement will be increased by the minimum
extent necessary such that the Aggregate Share Consideration does not exceed
the Maximum Share Number; it being understood that the Per Share Cash Amount
and the Exchange Ratio shall not change as a result of this _Section
1.1(e)_.

 



\- 2 - Section __ 1.2. _Interim Order_.

material respects with the applicable requirements of the Canadian Securities

(e) Each of the financial statements of Company included in the
Company Securities Reports, as of their respective dates (and as of the date
of any amendment to the respective Company Securities Report), (i) have been
prepared in accordance with IFRS (except, in the case of unaudited statements,
subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnote
disclosure) applied on a consistent basis during the periods and the dates
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and (ii) __ fairly

disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable
assurance that all material information required to be disclosed by Company
in its annual filings, interim filings or other reports filed or submitted
under Canadian Securities Laws is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified by Canadian Securities Laws, and that all
such material information is accumulated and communicated to the management
of Company as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Companys internal control over financial reporting (as such terms
are defined in National Instrument 52-109  _Certification of Disclosure in
Issuers_ __ _Annual and Interim Filings_ ) is sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with

transactions and dispositions of the assets of Company and its Subsidiaries;
(ii) __ provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with

regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or

material effect on its financial statements. The management of Company has

over financial reporting for the year ended September __ 24, 2016, and such
assessment concluded that such controls were effective. To the knowledge of
Company, as of the date of this Agreement, (i) __there are no material
weaknesses in the design and implementation or maintenance of its internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in National Instrument 52-109 
_Certification of Disclosure in Issuers  Annual and Interim Filings_) that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) __there is no
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Company s internal control over financial
reporting. As of the date of this Agreement, no executive officer of Company

structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on

Reports, as of their respective dates (or, if amended or superseded by a

contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the

regulations of the applicable U.S. Securities Laws with respect thereto, (ii)

and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)

that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,

management of Acquiror as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant
to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_
"). Acquirors internal control over financial reporting is sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that: (i) fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of

authorizations of management and directors of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries;
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of
Acquiror or its Subsidiaries that could have a material effect on
its financial statements. The management of Acquiror has completed its
assessment of the effectiveness of Acquirors internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2016, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective. To the knowledge of Acquiror, as of the
date of this Agreement, (i) __ there are no material weaknesses in the design

Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect Acquirors ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) __ there is no fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Acquirors internal control over financial reporting. As of the date of this

transaction or relationship between or among Acquiror or one of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,
on the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or effect of
such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries in

the knowledge of Acquiror, threatened against Acquiror or any of its

capacity) or affecting any of their respective businesses or assets that, if

would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror.

annexes and schedules thereto, collectively, the " _Commitment Letter_ ") to
provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing to

fully paid or caused to be fully paid any and all commitment fees or other
fees required to be paid in connection with the Commitment Letter that are

Acquiror, each of the other parties thereto and is in full force and effect,
in each case, except to the extent that such enforceability (i) __ may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
preference, moratorium and other similar laws of general
application affecting or relating to the enforcement of creditors rights

considered in a proceeding at law or in equity (the " _Bankruptcy and

breach under the Commitment Letter by Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries, or,
to the knowledge of Acquiror, any other parties thereto, and (y) __ no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Acquiror, any other parties thereto,

of any facts or circumstances or any reason to believe that any facts or
circumstances exist that, assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set

the Marketing Period, would be reasonably likely to result in any of the
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter not being satisfied or the
funding contemplated in the Commitment Letter not being made available on the
Effective Date. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter is not subject to
any conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder
(including pursuant to any flex provisions in the related fee letter or
otherwise) to make the full amount of the Financing available at the Closing,
or any contingencies that would permit the parties thereto to reduce the
amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth therein. As of the
date hereof, there are no side letters, arrangements or other Contracts to
which Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries is a party which could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the availability of the Financing, other than as
expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter (and the related fee letter).

\- 41 -  and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to
attend and participate, with the exception of meetings relating to the

analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals relating to any such filing, application, submission,
investigation or inquiry made or submitted by or on behalf of either Party. No
Party shall be required to share information related to its valuation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Either Party may, as it deems advisable,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive or confidential material or
information provided to the other Party under this _Section 4.4_ as "outside
counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be
given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and shall not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to directors, officers, employees or other

request to divest, sell, grant a license, dispose of, hold separate or
restrict its ownership and operation of, all or any portion of the business or
assets of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, including, for this purpose, Company

dispositions or holdings separate, or restrictions of ownership or operation
are, individually and in the aggregate, _de minimis_ in relation to the
businesses, operations and assets of Company, Acquiror and their respective

of license, dispositions or holdings separate, or restrictions of ownership or
operation would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected

expected benefits to Acquiror of the transactions contemplated hereby. For
greater certainty, with respect to the Investment Canada Act Approval,
Acquiror and its Subsidiaries will, if requested by a Governmental
Entity, agree to such undertakings as are commercially reasonable. At the
request of Acquiror, Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
cooperate with Acquirors negotiations to agree to divest, sell, grant a

fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated herein or
necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading in light of
the circumstances in which they are made and shall contain sufficient detail
to permit the shareholders of Company to form a reasoned judgment concerning
the matters to be placed before them at the Company Special Meeting. Upon
reasonable request, Acquiror shall furnish Company with all
information reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Circular or any amendment or supplement thereto. Without limiting the

Company shall (i) provide Acquiror and its legal counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and (ii) __
include in such document or response all reasonable comments that Acquiror
proposes. On the date of their filing or delivery, Company shall provide the
Acquiror with a copy of all such filings with, and all such responses
delivered to, the Court. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by
reference) to the Proxy Circular shall be made without the prior written
consent of Acquiror; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section
4.5(d)_ will limit Companys ability to exercise its rights under _Section
4.8_.

Section 4.6. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Acquiror shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued
and paid in the Arrangement to be approved for listing on the New York Stock

furnish information with respect to Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person
(and its Representatives) making such Company Acquisition Proposal pursuant to
a confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to Acquiror
promptly after its execution) not less restrictive of such Person than the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that such confidentiality agreement may
not include any provision calling for an exclusive right to negotiate with
Company and may not restrict Company from complying with this _Section 4.8_;
_provided_ , _further_ , that all such oral or written information (to the
extent that such information has not been previously provided to

 



\- 44 -  Acquiror) is provided or made available to Acquiror prior to or

_further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant this _Section

\- 63 - Section 6.3. _Acknowledgment_. __ Each Party acknowledges that the
agreements contained in _Section 6.2_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that without these agreements
the other Party would not enter into this Agreement, and that the amounts set
out in  _Section 6.2_ represent liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-
estimate of the damages, including opportunity costs, which either Party will
suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such damages and
resultant termination of this Agreement, and is not a penalty. Each Party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that any such
liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. In the event the amounts set out
in _Section 6.2_ are paid to the applicable Party (or as it directs), no
other amounts will be due and payable as damages or otherwise by (i) __ the
Party making such payments or (ii) __ in the case of payment of the Acquiror
Termination Fee, the Party making such payments and any Financing Source, and
the Party to whom such payments are made hereby accepts that such payments are
the maximum aggregate amount that (i) __ the Party making such payments or
(ii) __ in the case of payment of the Acquiror Termination Fee, the Party
making such payments and any Financing Source, shall be required to pay in
lieu of any damages or any other payments or remedy which the Party to whom
such payments are made may be entitled to in connection with this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement the Commitment Letter, the
transactions contemplated thereby, the Financing or the performance of
services with respect thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that this limitation
shall not apply in the event of fraud or willful and material breach by the
Party making such payments or any of its Subsidiaries of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (which
breach and liability therefore shall not be affected by termination of this
Agreement or any payment of the amounts set out in _Section 6.2_, as
applicable).

 

Section 6.4. _Amendment_. This Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement may, at
any time and from time to time before or after the Company Requisite
Shareholder Vote is obtained but not later than the Effective Time, be amended
by mutual written agreement of the Parties, and any such amendment may,
subject to the Interim Order and the Final Order and applicable Law,
without limitation:

(a) change the time for performance of any of the obligations or acts of the
Parties;

 

(b) waive any inaccuracies or modify any representation or warranty contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto;

 

(c) waive compliance with or modify any of the covenants herein contained and
waive or modify the performance of any of the obligations of the Parties;

(d) waive compliance with or modify any mutual conditions precedent herein
contained; or

 

(e) waive inaccuracies in any of the other Partys representations or
warranties contained herein or in any document delivered by the other Party;

 



\- 64 - _provided_ that (i) any such change or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party and, unless
otherwise provided in the written waiver, will be limited to the specific
breach or condition waived and (ii) no amendment to or waiver of any DFS
Provision that is materially adverse to any Financing Source shall be
effective without the written consent of such Financing Source or any
Commitment Party (as defined in the Commitment Letter) related to such
Financing Source.

 

Section 6.5. _Waiver_. Any Party may: (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or acts of the other Party; (b) __ waive
compliance, except as provided herein, with any of the other Partys
agreements or the fulfilment of any conditions to its own obligations
contained herein; or (c) __ waive inaccuracies in any of the other Partys
representations or warranties contained herein or in any document delivered by
the other Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such Party and, unless otherwise provided in the written waiver, will be
limited to the specific breach or condition waived. A Partys failure or delay
in exercising any right under this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of
that right. A single or partial exercise of any right will not preclude a
Party from any other or further exercise of that right or the exercise of any
other right.

Section 7.4. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

 

(a) This Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all prior understandings, agreements
or representations, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of this Agreement shall
supersede any conflicting provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) Except as provided in _Section 4.14_, this Agreement shall not confer any
rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their
respective permitted successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Financing Sources shall be express third-party beneficiaries with
respect to _Section 6.2(c)_ , _Section 6.2(d)_,  _Section 6.3_, the proviso
to _Section 6.4_, this proviso to this _Section 7.4(b)_, the second proviso
to _Section 7.6(a)_, the proviso to _Section 7.6(b)_, _Section 7.9_ and 
_Section 7.11_, and any provision or definition of this Agreement to the
extent a modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify
the substance of any of the foregoing provisions as they pertain to any
Financing Source (collectively, the " _DFS Provisions_ ").

Section 7.5. _Assignment; Binding Effect_. No Party may assign this Agreement
or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder (whether by operation
of Law or otherwise, including a merger or amalgamation) without the prior
written approval of the other Party, and any attempted assignment without such
prior written approval shall be void and without legal effect; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) Acquiror may assign its rights, interests and obligations
to an Affiliate of Acquiror at any time (but no such assignment shall relieve
Acquiror of its obligations under this Agreement) and (ii) __ this _Section
7.5_ shall not prohibit the assignment for security of Acquirors rights and
interests hereunder to Secured Parties (as defined under the credit
agreement referenced below (or any replacement, extension, renewal or
refinancing thereof)) under the terms of Acquirors existing credit agreement
with Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent (or any replacement,
extension, renewal or refinancing thereof) (but no such assignment shall
relieve Acquiror of its obligations under this Agreement). Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and
permitted assigns.

Section 7.6. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the Province of Quebec and the laws of Canada applicable therein;
_provided_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, subject in all respects to the
provisions of any other agreement (including any commitment letter or
definitive agreement relating to any financing) between any 

 



\- 67 -  Financing Source and any party hereto, all matters relating to any action or
claim against any Financing Source, and all matters relating to the
interpretation, construction, validity and enforcement (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise) against any Financing Source in
any way relating to the Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the
Financing, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws
of the State of New York.

(b) Each of Company and Acquiror hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
consents to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the
Province of Quebec for any litigation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence
any litigation relating thereto except in such court), waives any objection
to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the courts of the Province of
Quebec; _provided_ , _however_ , each Party agrees that it will not bring or
support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources (including each
Financing Sources and its respective Affiliates respective officers,
directors, employees, advisors, agents, Affiliates, controlling persons,
successors, partners, representatives and assigns) in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated therein, or the Financing
or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom).

 

Section 7.7. _Severability_. If the term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, then all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby
are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

Section 7.8. _Enforcement of Agreement_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform any
provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled in Law or in equity. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Party has
an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with such order or
injunction.

and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including
any legal proceeding against the Financing Sources arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, the Commitment
Letter, the transactions contemplated thereby, the Financing or the

end on the next succeeding Business Day. Any reference to any
supranational, national, state, provincial, municipal, local or foreign Law

the Arrangement pursuant to and in the manner set forth in Section 190 of the
CBCA, as modified by the Interim Order and this Section 5.1; provided that,

assigned and transferred all Company Common Shares held by such Dissenting
Shareholder, and in respect of which Dissent Rights have been validly
exercised, to Acquiror free and clear of all Liens, as provided in Section
3.1(c) and if such Dissenting Shareholder: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | is ultimately entitled to be paid fair value for its Company
Common Shares, such Dissenting Shareholder: (A) shall be deemed not to have
participated in the transactions in Article 3 (other than Section 3.1(c));
(B) will be entitled to be paid the fair value of such Company Common Shares
by Acquiror, which fair value, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Part XV of the CBCA, shall be determined as of the close
of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which the
Arrangement Resolution was adopted; and (C) will not be entitled to any other
payment or consideration, including any payment that would be payable under

such Dissenting Shareholder shall be removed from the register of Company
Shareholders as to those Company Common Shares in respect of which Dissent
Rights have been validly exercised at the same time as the event described in

with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

   Section 6.3 | Withholding Rights. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | Each of Company, Acquiror and the Depositary shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to
any Affected Securityholder under this Plan of Arrangement, such amounts as
Company, Acquiror or the Depositary is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to such payment under the Tax Act or any provision of applicable Laws
and shall remit such amounts to the appropriate Governmental Entity. To the
extent that amounts are so deducted, withheld and remitted, such deducted,

Dear Sirs/Madams:

Re: Support and Voting Agreement

I understand that you and Tembec Inc. (the "Corporation") wish to enter into
an arrangement agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "Arrangement
Agreement") contemplating an arrangement (the "Arrangement") of the
Corporation pursuant to Section 192 of the _Canada Business Corporations Act_
, the result of which shall be your acquisition of all the outstanding common
shares of the Corporation. I am the beneficial owner of [●] common shares of
the Corporation (the "Holder Securities"). Capitalized terms used but not
defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the
Arrangement Agreement.

I understand that I will have the right to terminate this letter agreement in
the event that, without my prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld), the Arrangement Agreement is amended to reduce or
adversely change the consideration to be received by holders of common shares
of the Corporation or is amended in any other respect that is materially
adverse to me.

I,  , hereby agree, in my capacity as
securityholder and not in my capacity as an officer or director of the
Corporation, from the date hereof until the earlier of the date on which the
(i) parties hereto agree otherwise in writing, (ii) Arrangement Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms, or (iii) Outside Date occurs:



     | (a) | to vote or to cause to be voted the Holder Securities, and
any other securities directly or indirectly acquired by or issued to the
undersigned after the date hereof (including without limitation any common
shares issued upon further exercise of options to purchase shares), (i) in
favour of the Arrangement and any other matter necessary for the consummation
of the Arrangement at the meeting of shareholders of the Corporation held to
consider it or any adjournment thereof and (ii) against any proposed action
or agreement which could impede, interfere with, delay or otherwise adversely
affect the consummation of the Arrangement; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | if requested by you, acting reasonably, to deliver or to
cause to be delivered to the Corporation, duly executed proxies or voting
instruction forms, as applicable, in your favour or in favour of the
Corporation, such proxies instructing the holder thereof to vote in favour of
the Arrangement; 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | not to exercise any rights to dissent in connection with the
Arrangement; 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | except in my capacity as director or officer to the extent
permitted by the Arrangement Agreement, not to take any action which may in
any way adversely affect the success of the Arrangement; 
---|---|--- extent permitted by the Arrangement Agreement, not to, directly or indirectly,
make or participate in or take any action that would reasonably be expected to
result in an Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any discussion, negotiation
or inquiries relating thereto or accept any Acquisition Proposal; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | not to, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, gift,
exchange, tender, pledge or assign or agree to sell, transfer, gift, exchange,
tender, pledge or assign any of the Holder Securities or any interest therein,
without your prior written consent. 
---|---|--- 

I hereby represent and warrant that (a) I am the sole beneficial owner of the
Holder Securities, with good and marketable title thereto free of any and all
encumbrances and demands of any nature or kind whatsoever, and I have the sole
right to vote and sell (in the case of transferable Holder Securities) all of
the Holder Securities, (b) except for the Arrangement Agreement, no person
has any agreement or option, or any right or privilege (whether by law, pre-
emptive or contractual) capable of becoming an agreement or option for the
purchase, acquisition or transfer from the undersigned of any of the Holder
Securities or any interest therein or right thereto, and (c) the only
securities of the Corporation (other than cash-settled deferred share
units) beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by the undersigned on the
date hereof are the Holder Securities.

Notwithstanding any provision of this letter agreement to the contrary, the
undersigned makes no agreement or understanding in this letter agreement in
the undersigneds capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation or any
of its subsidiaries, and nothing in this letter agreement: (a) will limit or
affect any actions or omissions taken by the undersigned in his/her capacity
as such a director or officer, including in exercising rights under the
Arrangement Agreement, and no such actions or omissions shall be deemed
a breach of this letter agreement or (b) will be construed to prohibit, limit
or restrict the undersigned from exercising his or her fiduciary duties as an
officer or director to the Corporation.

 

This letter agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Province of Quebec
and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein.

 

If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding and is agreed to by
you, please signify your acceptance by executing the enclosed copies of
this letter where indicated below and returning the same to the undersigned,
upon which this letter as so accepted shall constitute an agreement among us.
