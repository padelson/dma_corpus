as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the Closing,
neither NYB, Synergy nor any of their Affiliates shall knowingly take any
action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any

income tax consequences to Synergy stockholders as a result of the

reduced in amount; and (iii) such modification will not delay materially or
jeopardize the receipt of Regulatory Approvals or other consents and approvals
relating to the consummation of the Merger or the Bank Merger or otherwise
cause any condition to Closing set forth in Article IX not to be capable of
being fulfilled. The parties hereto agree to appropriately amend this
Agreement, or the Bank Merger Agreement, and any related documents in order to
reflect any such revised structure.

otherwise, in NYB its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of Synergy or its Subsidiaries; or (ii) otherwise

8 ARTICLE III

CONVERSION OF SHARES

3.1. _Conversion of Synergy Common Stock; Merger Consideration._  

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of NYB, Synergy or the holders of any of the shares of Synergy Common
Stock, the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the following terms:

3.1.1. Each share of NYB Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and outstanding
following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

3.1.2. Each share of Synergy Common Stock owned by NYB immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in
connection with debts previously contracted) shall, at the Effective Time,
cease to exist, and the certificates for such shares shall be canceled as
promptly as practicable thereafter, and no payment or distribution shall be
made in consideration therefor.

3.1.3. Each share of Synergy Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall become and be converted into, as
provided in and subject to the adjustments, if applicable, set forth in
Sections 3.1.5, 3.1.7 or 11.1.11 in this Agreement, the right to receive 0.80
shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of NYB Common Stock.

3.1.4. After the Effective Time, each share of Synergy Common Stock shall be
no longer outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease
to exist, and shall thereafter by operation of this section represent the
right to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions
with respect thereto, and any dividends or distributions with a record date
prior to the Effective Time that were declared or made by Synergy on such
shares of Synergy Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
on or prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective
Time.

3.1.5. In the event NYB changes (or establishes a record date for changing)
the number of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of NYB Common
Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result in each
case of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or
similar transaction with respect to the outstanding NYB Common Stock and the
record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio
shall be proportionately and appropriately adjusted.

3.1.6. The consideration that a holder of one share of Synergy Common Stock
is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article III is referred to herein as
the "Merger Consideration" and the consideration that all of the holders of
Synergy Common Stock are entitled to receive pursuant to this Article III is
referred to herein as the "Aggregate Merger Consideration."

3.1.7. _No Fractional Shares._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
NYB Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to NYB Common Stock
shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share interest, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of NYB. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, NYB shall pay to each former holder of Synergy Common Stock
who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of NYB Common
Stock, an amount in  



 

9  cash, rounded to the nearest cent and without interest, equal to the product
of (i) the fraction of a share to which such holder would otherwise have been
entitled and (ii) the closing sales price of a share of NYB Common Stock as
reported on the Stock Exchange for the trading day immediately preceding the
Closing Date. For purposes of determining any fractional share interest, all
shares of Synergy Common Stock owned by a Synergy stockholder shall be
combined so as to calculate the maximum number of whole shares of NYB Common
Stock issuable to such Synergy stockholder.

3.2. _Procedures for Exchange of Synergy Common Stock._

3.2.1. _NYB to Make Merger Consideration Available._ On or before the Closing
Date, NYB shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of the holders of Synergy Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this Section 3.2, certificates representing the shares of NYB
Common Stock (and cash, if applicable, pursuant to Section 11.1.11) pursuant
to this Article III (including any cash that may be payable in lieu of any
fractional shares of Synergy Common Stock) (such cash and certificates for
shares of NYB Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). 

3.2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. NYB shall take all commercially reasonable
steps necessary to cause the Exchange Agent, within five (5) business days
after the Effective Time, to mail to each holder of a Certificate or
Certificates, a form letter of transmittal for return to the Exchange Agent
and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates for
the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, into
which the Synergy Common Stock represented by such Certificates shall have
been converted as a result of the Merger. The letter of transmittal (which
shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Synergy) shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent. Upon
proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefore, as applicable, (i) a certificate representing that number
of shares of NYB Common Stock to which such former holder of Synergy Common
Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1.3
hereof (and, if applicable, pursuant to Section 11.1.11), and (ii) a check
representing the amount of cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of NYB
Common Stock, which such former holder has the right to receive in respect of
the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1.7, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

3.2.3. _Rights of Certificate Holders after the Effective Time_. The holder
of a Certificate that prior to the Merger represented issued and outstanding
Synergy Common Stock shall have no rights, after the Effective Time, with
respect to such Synergy Common Stock except to surrender the Certificate in
exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement. No
dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time with
respect to NYB Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof surrenders such
Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.2. After the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.2, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with
respect to shares of NYB Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

3.2.4. _Surrender by Persons Other than Record Holders_. If the Person
surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying letter of transmittal
is not the record holder thereof, then it shall be a condition of the payment
of the Merger Consideration that: (i) such Certificate is properly endorsed to
such Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either
case signed exactly as the name of the record holder appears on such
Certificate, and is otherwise in proper form for transfer, or is accompanied
by appropriate evidence of the authority of the Person surrendering such
Certificate and  



 

10  signing the letter of transmittal to do so on behalf of the record holder;
and (ii) the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange
Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or
is not payable.

3.2.5. _Closing of Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of Synergy of the Synergy
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be exchanged for the
Merger Consideration and canceled as provided in this Section 3.2.

3.2.6. _Return of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the twelve (12) month
period after the Effective Time, NYB shall be entitled to require the Exchange
Agent to deliver to it any portions of the Exchange Fund which had been made
available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates
(including, without limitation, all interest and other income received by the
Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look to NYB (subject to abandoned property,
escheat and other similar laws) with respect to any Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither NYB nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
holder of a Certificate for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of
such Certificate to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property,
escheat or other similar law.

3.2.7. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by NYB, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as NYB
may reasonably require as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof.

3.2.8. _Withholding._ NYB or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Synergy Common Stock such amounts as NYB (or any
Affiliate thereof) or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable
provision of federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that
such amounts are properly withheld by NYB or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the holder of the Synergy Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding were made by NYB or the Exchange Agent.

3.3. _Treatment of Synergy Options._

3.3.1 _Exchange for New Options_

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any holder of an option, each Synergy Option that is outstanding and
unexercised, whether vested or unvested, immediately prior thereto shall be
converted into an option (each, a "New Option") to purchase such number of
shares of NYB Common Stock at an exercise price determined as provided below
(and otherwise having the same duration and other terms as the original
Synergy Option);



     | (i) |

the number of shares of NYB Common Stock to be subject to the New Option shall
be equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Synergy Common
Stock purchasable   

---|---|--- 



 

11  upon exercise of the original Synergy Option and (B) the Exchange Ratio, the
product being rounded to the nearest whole share where (i) a tenth of a share
of 4 or less shall be rounded down and (ii) a tenth of a share of 5 or more
shall rounded up; and 

---|--- 



     | (ii) | the exercise price per share of NYB Common Stock under the
New Option shall be equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Synergy
Common Stock under the original Synergy Option divided by (B) the Exchange
Ratio, rounded to the nearest cent. 
---|---|--- 

With respect to any Synergy Options that are "incentive stock options" (as
defined in Section 422(b) of the Code), the foregoing adjustments shall be
effected in a manner consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. Synergy, or
its Board of Directors or an appropriate committee thereof, has taken all
action necessary on its part to give effect to the provisions of this Section
3.3.1.

At or prior to the Effective Time, Synergy shall make all necessary
arrangements with respect to its plans to permit assumption of the unexercised
Synergy Options by NYB pursuant to this Section 3.3.1 and as of the Effective
Time NYB shall assume such Synergy Options and the Synergy Option Plan under
which they have been issued. It is intended that such assumption shall be
undertaken consistent with and in a manner that will not constitute a
"modification" under Section 409A of the Code. 

NYB shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for future issuance a
sufficient additional number of shares of NYB Common Stock to provide for the
satisfaction of its obligations with respect to the New Options. Within three
(3) business days after the Effective Time, NYB shall file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor registration statement)
and make any state filings or obtain state exemptions with respect to the NYB
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the New Options and shall use
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus contained
therein) for so long as any New Option remain outstanding.

3.3.2 _Cash Out of Synergy Options_

Not later than ten (10) days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Synergy
shall be entitled to make a written offer to the holders of Synergy Stock
Options that are either then exercisable or shall become exercisable upon the
Effective Time permitting such holders to irrevocably elect to have all or a
designated number of their Synergy Stock Options cancelled at the Effective
Time for a per share cash cancellation price equal to the average closing
sales price of a share of NYB Common Stock as reported on the Stock Exchange
for the twenty (20) trading days next preceding the Closing Date multiplied
by the Exchange Ratio less the exercise price per share, which per share
cancellation price shall be paid by Synergy immediately prior to Effective
Time less applicable withholding taxes. In order to be binding, the written
irrevocable election of an optionholder must be received by Synergy not later
than the 2nd day prior to the anticipated Closing Date. Each written offer
notice to be issued by Synergy and the written election document to be
delivered by optionholders shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to NYB.

3.4. _Reservation of Shares._

NYB shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of the NYB Common
Stock for the purpose of issuing shares of NYB Common Stock to the
Synergy stockholders in accordance with this Article III.

execution of this Agreement, approval of this Agreement by the stockholders

forgiveness of indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due to any director or any
employee of Synergy or any Synergy Subsidiary under any Synergy Compensation

Mention", "Substandard", "Doubtful", "Loss", "Classified", "Criticized",
"Watch list" or words of similar import, together with the principal amount of
and accrued and unpaid interest on each such Loan and the identity of the
obligor thereunder, (4) where a reasonable doubt exists as to the timely
future collectability of principal and/or interest, whether or not interest is
still accruing or the loans are less than 90 days past due, (5) where, during
the past three years, the interest rate terms have been reduced and/or the
maturity dates have been extended subsequent to the agreement under which the
loan was originally created due to concerns regarding the borrowers ability
to pay in accordance with such initial terms, or (6) where a specific
reserve allocation exists in connection therewith, and (G) all assets
classified by Synergy Bank or any Synergy Bank Subsidiary as real estate
acquired through foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure, including in-substance
foreclosures, and all other assets currently held that were acquired through
foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure.

4.16.3. All loans receivable (including discounts) and accrued interest
entered on the books of Synergy and the Synergy Subsidiaries arose out of bona
fide arms-length transactions, were made for good and valuable consideration
in the ordinary course of Synergys or the appropriate Synergy Subsidiarys
respective business, and the notes or other evidences of indebtedness with
respect to such loans (including discounts) are true and genuine and are what
they purport to be. To the Knowledge of Synergy, the loans, discounts and the
accrued interest reflected on the books of Synergy and the Synergy
Subsidiaries are subject to no defenses, set-offs or counterclaims (including,
without limitation, those afforded by usury or truth-in-lending laws), except
as may be provided by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting
creditors rights generally or by general principles of equity. Except as set
forth in SYNERGY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.16.3, all such loans are owned by
Synergy or the appropriate Synergy Subsidiary free and clear of any liens.



 

24 4.16.4. The notes and other evidences of indebtedness evidencing the loans

same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at
the time for comparable transactions with other Persons, and (c) did not
involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other
unfavorable features. No loan or credit accommodation to any Affiliate of
Synergy or any Synergy Subsidiary is presently in default or, during the three
year period prior to the date of this Agreement, has been in default or has
been restructured, modified or extended. Neither Synergy nor any Synergy
Subsidiary has been notified that principal and interest with respect to any
such loan or other credit accommodation will not be paid when due or that the
loan grade classification accorded such loan or credit accommodation by
Synergy is inappropriate.

of the NJBCA (collectively, the "Takeover Laws").

more of Synergys Subsidiaries or their customers (all of which are set forth
in SYNERGY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.22), were in all material respects entered
into in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and
regulatory policies, and to the Knowledge of Synergy, with counterparties
believed to be financially responsible at the time; and to Synergys Knowledge
each of them constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of Synergy
or one of its Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance with its terms (except
as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights or by general equity
principles), and is in full force and effect. Neither Synergy nor any Synergy

stockholders from a financial point of view. Such opinion has not been
amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement. NYB shall be promptly
advised of any change, amendment or rescission of such opinion.

all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including but not limited to
accounts for which it serves as trustee, agent, custodian, personal
representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance

commitment relating to any of the foregoing. To the Knowledge of Synergy, the

each Synergy Subsidiary is in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable laws respecting employment and employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment and wages and hours, and are not engaged in any
unfair labor practice.

None of Synergy or Synergy Subsidiaries records, systems, controls, data or
information are recorded, stored, maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or

means of access thereto and therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership
and direct control of it or its subsidiaries or accountants except as would

6.2. _Current Information_.

ongoing operations at such times as NYB may reasonably request. Synergy will
promptly notify NYB of any material change in the normal course of its
business or in the operation of its  



 

37  properties and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, of any
governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the institution or the
threat of material litigation involving Synergy or any Synergy Subsidiary.

6.2.2. Synergy Bank and New York Community Bank shall meet on a regular basis
to discuss and plan for the conversion of Synergy Banks data processing and
related electronic informational systems to those used by New York Community
Bank, which planning shall include, but not be limited to, discussion of the

arrangements effective at the Effective Time or at a date thereafter, non-
renewal of personal property leases and software licenses used by Synergy
Bank in connection with its systems operations, retention of outside
consultants and additional employees to assist with the conversion, and
outsourcing, as appropriate, of proprietary or self-provided system services,
it being understood that Synergy Bank shall not be obligated to take any such
action prior to the Effective Time and, unless Synergy Bank otherwise agrees,
no conversion shall take place prior to the Effective Time, with the goal
of conducting such conversion simultaneously with the consummation of the
Bank Merger. In the event that Synergy Bank takes, at the request of New York
Community Bank, any action relative to third parties to facilitate the
conversion that results in the imposition of any termination fees or charges,
New York Community Bank shall indemnify Synergy Bank for any such fees and
charges, and the costs of reversing the conversion process, if the Merger is
not consummated for any reason other than a breach of this Agreement by
Synergy, or a termination of this Agreement under Section 11.1.9 or 11.1.10.

6.2.3. Synergy Bank shall provide New York Community Bank, within fifteen
(15) business days of the end of each calendar month, a written list of
nonperforming assets (the term "nonperforming assets," for purposes of this

in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15, "Accounting by Debtors
and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructuring," (ii) loans on nonaccrual,
(iii) real estate owned, (iv) all loans ninety (90) days or more past due) as

material features of the loan.

6.2.4. Synergy shall promptly inform NYB upon receiving notice of any legal,
administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, demands, notices, audits or
investigations (by any federal, state or local commission, agency or board)
relating to the alleged liability of Synergy or any Synergy Subsidiary under
any labor or employment law.

6.3. _Access to Properties and Records_.

In order to facilitate the consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger and
the integration of the business and operations of the parties to
this Agreement, subject to Section 12.1 hereof, Synergy shall permit NYB and
its officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives, reasonable access, upon reasonable notice and throughout the
period before the Effective Time, to its resources, personnel and properties
and those of the Synergy Subsidiaries, and shall disclose and make available
to NYB and its officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives during normal business hours all of its books, papers and
records relating to the assets, properties, operations, obligations and
liabilities, including, but not limited to, all books of account (including
the general ledger), tax records, minute books of directors (other than
minutes that discuss any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
any Acquisition Proposal or any other subject matter Synergy reasonably
determines should be treated as confidential) and stockholders meetings,
organizational documents, Bylaws, material contracts and agreements, filings
with any regulatory authority, litigation files, plans affecting employees,
and any other business activities or prospects in  



 

38  which NYB may have a reasonable interest; provided, however, that Synergy
shall not be required to take any action that would provide access to or
to disclose information where such access or disclosure would violate or
prejudice the rights or business interests or confidences of any customer or
other Person or would result in the waiver by it of the privilege protecting
communications between it and any of its counsel. Synergy shall upon NYBs
reasonable request provide NYB with access to Synergys records and systems
for the purpose of allowing NYB to obtain account and transaction information
in connection with NYBs efforts to complete a migration or integration of
such data into its systems and planning for same. Such access shall include,
without limitation, computer data linkage to Synergys system prior to the
Effective Time if NYB deems that to be reasonably necessary or appropriate.
Synergy hereby consents to NYB sharing such information, on a confidential
basis and in compliance with the provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and
any applicable regulations, with such vendors as NYB deems to be necessary or
appropriate for the purpose of preparing for and implementing the required
systems integration or account migration. Synergy shall provide and shall
request its auditors to provide NYB with such historical financial
information regarding it (and related audit reports and consents) as NYB may
reasonably request for securities disclosure purposes. NYB shall use
commercially reasonable best efforts to minimize any interference with
Synergys regular business operations during any such access to Synergys
property, books and records. Synergy and each Synergy Subsidiary shall permit
NYB, at NYBs expense, to cause a "phase I environmental audit" and a "phase
II environmental audit" to be performed at any physical location owned or
occupied by Synergy or any Synergy Subsidiary.

6.4. _Financial and Other Statements_. 

6.4.1. Promptly upon receipt thereof, Synergy will furnish to NYB copies of
each annual or special audit of the books of Synergy and the Synergy
Subsidiaries made by its independent accountants and copies of all internal
control reports submitted to Synergy by such accountants in connection with
each annual, interim or special audit of the books of Synergy and the
Synergy Subsidiaries made by such accountants.

6.4.2. As soon as reasonably available, but in no event later than the date
such documents are filed with the SEC, Synergy will deliver to NYB the
Securities Documents filed by it with the SEC under the Securities Laws unless
the Securities Documents are available on the EDGAR System maintained by the
SEC, in which instance, Synergy shall notify NYB of the filing on the date
thereof. Synergy will furnish to NYB copies of all documents, statements and
reports as it or any Synergy Subsidiary shall send to its stockholders, the
FDIC, the FRB, the OTS or any other regulatory authority, except as legally
prohibited thereby. Within twenty-five (25) days after the end of each month,
Synergy will deliver to NYB a consolidated balance sheet and a consolidated
statement of operations, without related notes, for such month prepared in
accordance with current financial reporting practices.

6.4.3. With reasonable promptness, Synergy will furnish to NYB such
additional financial data that Synergy possesses and as NYB may reasonably
request, including without limitation, loan reports.

6.5. _Maintenance of Insurance_.

Synergy shall maintain, and cause each Synergy Subsidiary to maintain,
insurance in such amounts as Synergy deems reasonable to cover such risks as
are customary in relation to the character and location of theirs properties
and the nature of their business.



 

39 6.6. _Disclosure Supplements._

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, Synergy will promptly
supplement or amend the SYNERGY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES delivered in
connection herewith with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if
existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be set forth or described in such SYNERGY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE or
which is necessary to correct any information in such SYNERGY DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE which has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement
or amendment to such SYNERGY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE shall have any effect for the
purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX
and shall be for informational purposes only.

6.7. _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties_. 

Synergy shall use all commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain as soon
as practicable all consents and approvals necessary or desirable for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan

shall utilize the services of a professional proxy soliciting firm to
provide assistance in obtaining the stockholder vote required to be obtained
by it hereunder.

6.8. _All Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, Synergy agrees to use all
commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan of Bank
Merger.

6.9. _Failure to Fulfill Conditions_.

In the event that Synergy determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the Merger or the Bank Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will
not waive that condition, it will promptly notify NYB.

6.10. _No Solicitation_.

From and after the date hereof until the termination of this Agreement,
neither Synergy, nor any Synergy Subsidiary, nor any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, representatives, agents or affiliates
(including, without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by Synergy or any of its Subsidiaries), will, directly or indirectly,
initiate, solicit or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public
information or assistance) any inquiries or the making or implementation of
any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined below), or enter into or maintain or continue
discussions or negotiate with any Person in furtherance of such inquiries, or
authorize or permit any of its officers, directors, or employees or any of its
subsidiaries or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant
or other representative retained by any of its subsidiaries to take any
such action, and Synergy shall notify NYB orally (within one business day)
and in writing (as promptly as practicable) of all of the relevant details
relating to all inquiries and proposals which it or any of its Subsidiaries or
any such officer, director, employee, investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other representative may receive relating to any of
such matters, _provided, however_ , that nothing contained in this Section
6.10 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of Synergy from furnishing
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any Person
that makes an unsolicited written proposal to acquire Synergy pursuant to a
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, tender or
exchange offer or other similar  



 

40  transaction, if, and only to the extent that, (A) the Board of Directors of
Synergy determines, after consultation with and after considering the
advice of its independent financial advisor, that such proposal is superior
to the Merger from a financial point-of-view to Synergys stockholders, (B)
the Board of Directors of Synergy, after consultation with and after
considering the advice of independent legal counsel, determines in good faith
that the failure to furnish information to or enter into discussions with such
Person would be inconsistent with the Board of Directors of Synergys
fiduciary duties under applicable law; (C) such Acquisition Proposal was not
solicited by Synergy and did not otherwise result from a breach of this
Section 6.10 by Synergy (such proposal that satisfies (A), (B) and (C) being
referred to herein as a "Superior Proposal"); (D) Synergy promptly notifies
NYB of such inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such information
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to be initiated
or continued with Synergy or any of its representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice the material terms and conditions of any
inquiries, proposals or offers, and receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement; and (E) the Synergy Stockholders Meeting has not
occurred. For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any
proposal or offer as to any of the following (other than the transactions
contemplated hereunder) involving Synergy or any of its Subsidiaries: (i) any
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, or other similar
transactions; (ii) any sale, lease, share exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer
or other disposition of the consolidated assets of Synergy, in a
single transaction or series of transactions other than in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice; (iii) any tender offer or
exchange offer for 25% or more of the outstanding shares of capital stock of
Synergy or the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act in
connection therewith; or (iv) any public announcement of a proposal, plan or
intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the
foregoing.

6.11. _Reserves and Merger-Related Costs_.

Synergy agrees to consult with NYB with respect to its loan, litigation and
real estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications
and levels of reserves). NYB and Synergy shall also consult with respect to
the character, amount and timing of restructuring charges to be taken by
Synergy in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and shall take
such charges as NYB shall reasonably request, provided that no such actions
need be effected until the conditions set forth in Sections 9.1. and 9. 3
have been satisfied and until NYB shall have irrevocably certified to Synergy
that all conditions set forth in Article IX to the obligation of NYB to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than the delivery of
certificates or opinions) have been satisfied or, where legally permissible,
waived. No action taken by Synergy in accordance with this Section 6.11 shall
constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy
any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition or other
provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether
any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred.

 

6.12. _Takeover Laws_.

If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Synergy, in conjunction with NYB,
and the members of Synergys Board of Directors, in conjunction with NYBs
Board of Directors, will grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary (other than any action requiring the approval of Synergys
stockholders other than as contemplated by Section 8.1) so that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of any Takeover Laws on any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

described in such NYB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE or which is necessary to correct any
information in such NYB DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE which has been rendered materially
inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such NYB DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE shall have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Article IX and shall be for informational purposes
only.

7.5. _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties_.

NYB shall use all commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain as soon as
practicable all consents and approvals necessary or desirable for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by  



 

42  this Agreement and the Plan of Bank Merger.

7.6. _All Reasonable Best Efforts_.

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, NYB agrees to use all
commercially reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan of
Bank Merger.

7.7. _Failure to Fulfill Conditions_.

In the event that NYB determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the Merger or the Bank Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will
not waive that condition, it will promptly notify Synergy.

7.8. _Employee Benefits._

7.8.1. Subject to Section 4.9.4, NYB agrees that it will honor all Synergy
Compensation and Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time as disclosed in the SYNERGY
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may
be required by the terms of this Agreement. NYB will review all Synergy
Compensation and Benefit Plans that are generally and uniformly provided to
employees to determine whether to maintain, terminate or continue such plans.
In the event employee compensation and/or benefits as currently provided by
Synergy or any Synergy Subsidiary are changed or terminated by NYB, in whole
or in part, NYB shall provide Continuing Employees (as defined below) with
compensation and benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially similar to
the compensation and benefits provided to similarly situated employees of NYB
or its applicable NYB Subsidiary (as of the date any such compensation or
benefit is provided); provided, however, that Continuing Employees shall not
be eligible to participate in the NYB employee stock ownership plan until
the first day of the first plan year beginning after the Effective Time.
Continuing Employees who become participants in an NYB compensation and
benefit plan shall, for purposes of determining eligibility for and for any
applicable vesting periods of such employee benefits only (and not for
benefit accrual purposes except for vacation or as otherwise specifically set
forth herein) be given credit for meeting eligibility and vesting requirements
in such plans for service as an employee of Synergy or any Synergy Subsidiary
or any predecessor thereto prior to the Effective Time. This Agreement shall
not be construed to limit the ability of NYB or New York Community Bank to
terminate the employment of any employee or to review employee
benefits programs from time to time and to make such changes as they deem
appropriate.

7.8.2. In the event of any termination or consolidation of any Synergy health
plan with any NYB health plan, NYB shall make available to employees of
Synergy or any Synergy Subsidiary who continue employment with NYB or a NYB
Subsidiary ("Continuing Employees") and their dependents employer-provided
health coverage on the same basis as it provides such coverage to NYB
employees. Unless a Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates coverage
under a Synergy health plan prior to the time that such Continuing Employee
becomes eligible to participate in the NYB health plan, no coverage of any of
the Continuing Employees or their dependents shall terminate under any of the
Synergy health plans prior to the time such Continuing Employees and their
dependents become eligible to participate in the health plans, programs and
benefits generally available to all employees of NYB and New York Community
Bank and their dependents. In the event of a termination or consolidation of
any Synergy health plan, terminated Synergy employees and qualified
beneficiaries will have the right to continued coverage under group health
plans of NYB in accordance with Code Section 4980B(f), consistent with the
provisions below. In the event of any termination of any Synergy health plan,
or consolidation of any Synergy health plan with any NYB health plan, any
coverage limitation  



 

43  under the NYB health plan due to any pre-existing condition shall be waived
by the NYB health plan to the degree that such condition was covered by
the Synergy health plan and such condition would otherwise have been covered
by the NYB health plan in the absence of such coverage limitation. All Synergy
Employees who cease participating in a Synergy health plan and become
participants in a comparable NYB health plan shall receive credit for any co-
payment and deductibles paid under Synergys health plan for purposes of
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the
NYB health plan, upon substantiation, in a form satisfactory to NYB that such
co-payment and/or deductible has been satisfied.

7.8.3. Neither party hereto nor any of its Subsidiaries shall take or refrain
from taking any action or be required to take or refrain from taking any
action with respect to any Synergy Compensation and Benefit Plan that would
subject any participant thereunder to additional tax under Section 409A of
the Code.

7.8.4 NYB or New York Community Bank shall establish an advisory board and
offer membership to those individuals serving as directors of Synergy or
Synergy Bank as of the Effective Time. Members shall receive $10,000 per year
for service on such advisory board which shall remain in place for a minimum
of two years.

7.9. _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

7.9.1. NYB shall maintain in effect for six (6) years following the Effective
Time, the current directors and officers liability insurance policies
maintained by Synergy (provided, that NYB may substitute therefor policies of
at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not
materially less favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior to or at
the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event shall NYB be required
to expend in the aggregate pursuant to this Section 7.9.1 more than 150% of
the annual cost currently expended by Synergy with respect to such insurance
(the "Maximum Amount"); _provided, further,_ that if the amount of the annual
premium necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the
Maximum Amount, NYB shall maintain the most advantageous policies of
directors and officers insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the
Maximum Amount. In connection with the foregoing, Synergy agrees in order for
NYB to fulfill its agreement to provide directors and officers liability
insurance policies for six years to provide such insurer or substitute insurer
with such reasonable and customary representations as such insurer may
request with respect to the reporting of any prior claims.

7.9.2. In addition to 7.9.1, from and after the Effective Time, NYB shall
indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or who has been at any
time before the date hereof, or who becomes before the Effective Time, an
officer or director of Synergy (the "Indemnified Parties") against all
losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including attorneys fees),
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement (which
settlement shall require the prior written consent of NYB, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, or
administrative (each a "Claim"), in which an Indemnified Party is, or is
threatened to be made, a party or witness in whole or in part on or arising
in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director or
officer of Synergy or a Synergy Subsidiary if such Claim pertains to any
matter of fact arising, existing or occurring at or before the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed
before, or after, the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Liabilities"), to the
fullest extent permitted under Synergys Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws to the extent permitted by applicable law. NYB shall pay expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each
Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by applicable state or Federal
law upon receipt of an undertaking to repay such advance payments if the  



 

44  Indemnified Party shall be adjudicated or determined to be not entitled to
indemnification in the manner set forth below. Any Indemnified Party wishing
to claim indemnification under this Section 7.9.2 upon learning of any Claim,
shall notify NYB (but the failure so to notify NYB shall not relieve it from
any liability which it may have under this Section 7.9.2, except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices NYB) and shall deliver to NYB the
undertaking referred to in the previous sentence. In the event of any such
Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective Time) (1) after the
Effective Time NYB shall have the right to assume the defense thereof (in
which event the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such
matter) and upon such assumption NYB shall not be liable to any Indemnified
Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof, except that if NYB elects not to assume such defense, or counsel for
the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that there
are or may be (whether or not any have yet actually arisen) issues which raise
conflicts of interest between NYB and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified
Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them, and NYB shall pay
the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties,
(2) NYB shall be obligated pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one firm
of counsel for all Indemnified Parties whose reasonable fees and expenses
shall be paid promptly as statements are received except to the extent the
interests of such Indemnified Parties may conflict, (3) NYB shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), and (4)
no indemnification shall be available to the extent the person seeking
indemnification has not acted in good faith and in a manner such person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of Synergy
or a Synergy Subsidiary or its successor, and with respect to any criminal
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The
determination shall be made by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of
the Directors of NYB who are not involved in such proceeding.

7.9.3. NYB shall pay all expenses (including attorneys fees) that may
be reasonably incurred by an Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations of NYB under this Section 7.9; provided, however, that NYB
shall only be required to pay such expenses contemplated if it is first
determined by final judicial decision that such Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnity under this Section 7.9.

7.9.4. In the event that either NYB or any of its successors or assigns to
the extent not assumed by operation of law, transfers all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of NYB
shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.9.

7.9.5. The obligations of NYB provided under this Section 7.9 are intended to
be enforceable against NYB directly by the Indemnified Parties and shall be
binding on all respective successors and permitted assigns of NYB.

7.10. _Stock Listing_.

NYB agrees to list on the Stock Exchange (or such other national securities
exchange on which the shares of the NYB Common Stock shall be listed as of the
date of consummation of the Merger), subject to official notice of issuance,
the shares of NYB Common Stock to be issued in the Merger.

7.11. _Stock Reserve._

NYB agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the Merger
Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of shares
of its common stock to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.



 

45 7.12. _Section 16(b) Exemption_.

NYB and Synergy agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain
Synergy Insiders in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the
Effective Time, it is desirable that Synergy Insiders not be subject to a risk
of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of
Synergy Common Stock into shares of NYB in the Merger, and for that
compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section
7.12. Assuming that Synergy delivers to NYB the Synergy Section 16 Information
in a timely fashion prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
NYB, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined
for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably
promptly thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a
resolution providing in substance that the receipt by the Synergy Insiders (as
defined below) of NYB Common Stock in exchange for shares of Synergy Common
Stock and/or New Options for Synergy Options, pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are listed in the
Synergy Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law. "Synergy Section 16 Information" means
information accurate in all material respects regarding the Synergy Insiders,
the number of shares of Synergy Common Stock held by each such Synergy Insider
and expected to be exchanged for NYB Common Stock in the Merger and the
number and description of the Synergy Options expected to be converted to New
Options in connection with the Merger; provided the requirement for a
description of any Synergy Options shall be deemed to be satisfied if copies
of all plans and copies of all executed agreements, under which such options
have been granted have been delivered to NYB. "Synergy Insiders" means those
officers and directors of Synergy who are subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and who are expected to be
subject to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to NYB Common Stock
subsequent to the Effective Time.

sentence, the Board of Directors of Synergy shall (i) recommend approval of
this Agreement by the Synergy stockholders, (ii) take all reasonable lawful
action to solicit approval of this Agreement by the Synergy stockholders and

modify or qualify any such recommendation only if such Board of Directors,
after having consulted with and considered the advice of outside counsel to

best efforts to file the Merger Registration Statement, including the

SEC and shall give Synergy and its counsel the opportunity to review and
comment on all amendments and supplements to the Proxy Statement-Prospectus
and all responses to requests for additional information and replies to
comments prior to their being filed with, or sent to, the SEC. Each of NYB and
Synergy agrees to use all reasonable best efforts, after consultation with the
other party hereto, to respond promptly to all such comments of and requests
by the SEC and to cause the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and all required
amendments and supplements thereto to be mailed to the holders of Synergy
Common Stock entitled to vote at the Synergy Stockholders Meeting hereof at
the earliest practicable time.

8.2.3. Synergy and NYB shall promptly notify the other party if at any time it
becomes aware that the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Merger Registration
Statement contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. In such event, Synergy shall cooperate with NYB in
the preparation of a supplement or amendment to such Proxy Statement-
Prospectus that corrects such misstatement or omission, and NYB shall file an
amended Merger Registration Statement with the SEC, and Synergy shall mail an
amended Proxy Statement-Prospectus to the Synergy stockholders.

8.3. _Regulatory Approvals_.

Each of Synergy and NYB will cooperate with the other and use all reasonable
best efforts to promptly prepare all necessary documentation, to effect all

Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger, and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Synergy shall have the right to review and

Synergy: 

11.1.1. At any time by the mutual written agreement of the Boards of Directors
of each of NYB and Synergy;

11.1.2. By the Board of Directors of either party (provided, that the
terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have
been a material breach of any of the representations or warranties set forth
in this Agreement on the part of the other party, which breach by its nature
cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date or shall not have been cured
within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach by the terminating
party to the other party provided, however, that neither party shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1.2 unless the
breach of representation or warranty, together with all other such breaches,
would entitle the terminating party not to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby under Section 9.2.1 (in the case of a breach of a
representation or warranty by Synergy) or Section 9.3.1 (in the case of a
breach of a representation or warranty by NYB);

which failure by its nature cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date or
shall not have been cured within thirty (30) days after written notice of
such failure by the terminating party to the other party provided, however,
that neither party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 11.1.3 unless the breach of covenant or agreement, together

such partys material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
other agreement contained in this Agreement;

Synergy shall have voted at the Synergy Stockholders Meeting on this
Agreement and such vote shall not have been sufficient to approve this

against Synergy or its Subsidiaries under this Agreement, it being agreed that
the acceptance of the NYB Fee under Section 11.2.2(C) will constitute the sole

When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or Exhibits,
such reference shall be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The recitals hereto constitute an integral part of this
Agreement. References to Sections include subsections, which are part of the
related Section (e.g., a section numbered "Section 5.5.1" would be part of
"Section 5.5" and references to "Section 5.5" would also refer to material
contained in the subsection described as "Section 5.5.1"). The table of
contents, index and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation". The phrases "the date of this Agreement", "the date
hereof" and terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires,

or indirectly, by such Person within the meaning of Section 2(2) of the HOLA.
When a reference is made in this Agreement to an affiliate of a Person, the
term "affiliate" (or "Affiliate") means those other Persons that, directly or
indirectly, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with, such
Person.

(b) Insofar as any provision of the Agreement shall require a subsidiary or an
affiliate of a party to take or omit to take any action, such provision shall
be deemed a covenant by NYB or Synergy, as the case may be, to cause such
action or omission to occur.

12.12. _Waiver of Jury Trial_.

Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise
under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues,
and therefore each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any
right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation,
directly or indirectly, arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement, or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party certifies and
acknowledges that (a) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not,
in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) each
party understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) each
party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) each party has been induced to
enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 12.12.

AFFILIATES AGREEMENT

_____________________, 2007

New York Community Bancorp, Inc.

615 Merrick Avenue

Westbury, New York 11590

Gentlemen:

I have been advised that I might be considered to be an "affiliate" of Synergy
Financial Group, Inc., a New Jersey corporation ("Synergy"), for purposes of
paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act").

New York Community Bancorp, Inc. ("NYB") and Synergy have entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of _____________________, 2007 (the
"Agreement"). Upon consummation of the merger contemplated by the Agreement
(the "Merger"), I may receive shares of common stock of NYB ("NYB Common
Stock") (i) in exchange for my shares of common stock, par value $0.10 per
share, of Synergy ("Synergy Common Stock") or (ii) as a result of the exercise
of Rights (as defined in the Agreement). This agreement is hereinafter
referred to as the "Letter Agreement."

I represent and warrant to, and agree with, NYB as follows:

1\. I have read this Letter Agreement and the Agreement and have discussed
their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell,
pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of shares of NYB Common Stock to be
received by me pursuant to the Merger, to the extent I felt necessary, with my
counsel or counsel for Synergy.

2\. I have been advised that any issuance of shares of NYB Common Stock to me
pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the SEC. I have also been
advised, however, that, because I may be an "affiliate" of Synergy at the time
the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders of Synergy and my
disposition of such shares has not been registered under the Securities Act, I
must hold such shares indefinitely unless (i) such disposition of such shares
is subject to an effective registration statement and to the availability of
a prospectus under the Securities Act, (ii) a sale of such shares is made in
conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act, (iii)
a sale of such shares is made following expiration of the restrictive period
set forth in Rule 145(d)(2) or (iv) in an opinion of counsel, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to NYB, I am advised that some other
exemption from registration is available with respect to any such proposed
disposition of such shares.

3\. I understand and agree that stop transfer instructions will be given to
the transfer agent of NYB with respect to the shares of NYB Common Stock I
receive pursuant to the Merger and that there will be placed on the
certificate representing such shares, or any certificates delivered in
substitution therefor, a legend stating in substance:

The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to
which Rule 145 under the Securities Act applies. The shares represented by
this certificate may only be transferred in  



 

C-1  accordance with Rule 145(d) or an effective registration statement or
exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

4\. Unless a transfer of my shares of the NYB Common Stock is a sale made in
conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d), made following expiration
of the restrictive period set forth in Rule 145(d) or made pursuant to any
effective registration statement under the Securities Act, NYB reserves the
right to put an appropriate legend on the certificate issued to my transferee.

It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and be
of no further force and effect if the Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms. It is also understood and agreed that this Letter
Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect and the stop
transfer instructions set forth above shall be lifted forthwith upon the
delivery by the undersigned to NYB of a copy of a letter from the staff of
the SEC, an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to NYB, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to NYB, to the effect that a
transfer of my shares of NYB Common Stock will not violate the Securities Act
or any of the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. In addition, it is
understood and agreed that the legend set forth in Paragraph 3 above shall be
removed forthwith from the certificate or certificates representing my shares
of NYB Common Stock upon expiration of the restrictive period set forth in
Rule 145(d)(2), so long as NYB is then in compliance with SEC Rule 144(c), or
if NYB shall have received a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, an
opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to NYB, or
other evidence satisfactory to NYB that a transfer of my shares of the NYB
Common Stock represented by such certificate or certificates will be a sale
made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d), or made pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act. __

5\. NYB hereby agrees (i) to make available adequate public information with
respect to itself as provided in Rule 144(a) under the Securities Act, (ii) to
provide and pay for a legal opinion (prepared by in-house attorneys for NYB or
legal counsel to NYB) with respect to compliance with Rule 144 and 145 if
required for my transfer or sale of shares in accordance therewith, and (iii)
to otherwise cooperate to the extent reasonably possible in order that I may
legally transfer or sell my shares of NYB Common Stock.

6\. I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my
spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouses occupying my home, (iii) any
trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10%
beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in
any similar capacity and (iv) any corporation or other organization in which
I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity
securities or of the equity interest.

7\. I further recognize that in the event I become a director or officer of
NYB upon consummation of the Merger, any sale of NYB Common Stock by me may
subject me to liability pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended.

8\. Execution of this Letter Agreement should not be construed as an admission
on my part that I am an "affiliate" of Synergy as described in the first
paragraph of this Letter Agreement or as a waiver of any rights I may have to
object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this
Letter Agreement.

successful integration of the operation of Synergys business with the
Banks business and wishes to secure the Employees continued services during
a transition period following the Effective Time by providing the Employee
with a financial incentive to remain in the Banks employ. The Employee,
understanding the circumstances, has agreed to execute this Agreement and
observe its terms.



     | 1. | _Term of Agreement_. 
---|---|--- 

This Agreement shall become effective and begin immediately following the
Effective Time (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) and shall

     | 2. | _Place of Employment and Extent of Services_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) During the Term, the Employees principal place of employment and office
shall be at the same location as immediately before the Effective Time.

(b) During the Term, the Employee shall serve as an employee of the Bank,
performing such duties and having such position, title and authority as may be
assigned to him by the President of the Bank. The Employee shall devote his
full business time and attention (other than during weekends, holidays,

to the business and affairs of the Bank and shall use his best efforts to
advance its best interests.



     | 3. | _Compensation and Benefits_. 
---|---|---

D-1 ---|---|--- 

The Employees employment with the Bank may be terminated during the Term at

discharge for cause (as hereinafter defined), the Bank shall pay to the
Employee (or, in the event of his death, to his estate) his earned but
unpaid compensation (including, without limitation, salary and all other
items which constitute wages under applicable law) as of the date of his

manner prescribed by law applicable to the payment of wages but in no event

of which the Employee qualifies for disability insurance benefits under the
Banks group long-term disability insurance plan or under the federal Social
Security Act, the Bank shall pay the Employee the amount, if any, of the
remaining amount of Retention Compensation the Employee would have received
over the Term but for the early termination of the Agreement. The Bank shall
pay such amount, if any, in a single lump sum as soon as practicable following
termination of employment.

The Bank shall have the right to discharge the Employee for "cause" if it
determines that the Employee has committed gross negligence in the performance
of, or continually neglects, after due notice, to perform his assigned duties
which are reasonable in light of the employees position and experience; has
been convicted or entered a plea of guilty or _nolo contendere_ to, the

profit or other circumstance likely, in the reasonable judgment of the Bank,
to have a material adverse effect on the Bank or its business, operations or
reputation; or has violated, in any material respect, any law,
rule, regulation, written agreement or final cease-and-desist order
applicable to the Bank in his performance of services for the Bank.



     | 5. | _Termination After the Term_.

result in a termination of the Employees employment with the Bank. Upon the
termination of the Employees employment, other than for cause (as defined
above), for a period of thirty-six months following the Employees
termination date, the Employee and Employees dependent family shall continue
to be eligible to participate in the medical, vision care and dental insurance
plans sponsored by the Bank or any successor thereto with the total cost of
such premiums paid by the Bank. The provisions of this Section shall survive
the expiration of the Term or the termination of this Agreement. Upon
termination of employment of the Employee for any reason, the Bank will

The Employee agrees that he will not, at any time, disclose to any unauthorized Persons, or use for his own account or for the benefit of any third party any Confidential Information, whether or not the Confidential Information is embodied in writing or other physical form, without NYBs express written consent, unless and to the extent that such Confidential Information is or becomes generally known to and available for use by the public other than as a result of Employees fault or the fault of any other Person bound by a duty of confidentiality to NYB. 

5. Compensation. In consideration of the covenants contained in this Agreement, NYB shall pay the Employee (or his estate) the sum of $600,000 in accordance with the following schedule: (i) $400,000 on the date of his termination of employment for any reason with New York Community Bank and $200,000 on the first anniversary of such employment termination date. All payments shall be less applicable withholding taxes. In the event of the death of the Employee on or after the date of the consummation of the Merger, the unpaid amounts under this Section 5 shall become immediately payable in full in a single lump sum payment to the estate of the Employee, which payment shall be made within thirty (30) days after his death. 

6. Remedies. The parties hereto, recognizing that irreparable injury will result to NYB, its business and property in the event of the Employees breach of this Agreement, hereby consent, in the event of any such breach by the Employee, to an injunction in favor of NYB, in addition to any other remedies and damages available, to restrain the violation hereof by the Employee, the Employees partners, agents, servants, employers, employees and all persons acting for or with the Employee. The Employee represents and admits that the Employees experience and capabilities are such that the Employee can obtain employment in a business engaged in other industries and/or of a different nature than NYB, and that the enforcement of a remedy by way of injunction will not prevent the Employee from earning a livelihood. Nothing herein will be construed as prohibiting NYB from pursuing any other remedies available to NYB for such breach or threatened breach, including the recovery of damages from the Employee. In no event will NYBs monetary relief for damages be less than all amounts previously paid by it to the Employee pursuant to this Agreement. 

7. Waiver. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the  



 

E-2  other party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable
except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to
or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such
party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take
further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement.

8. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Employee and NYB and will inure to the benefit of NYB and its affiliates, successors and assigns and the Employee and the Employees assigns, estate, heirs and legal representatives. 

9. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to conflicts of laws principles. 

10. Severability. If any provision in this Agreement is declared or determined by any court to be illegal, void, or unenforceable, the illegality or unenforceability of such provision shall have no effect upon, and shall not impair, the enforceability or validity of any other provisions in this Agreement. If any of the covenants set forth in this Agreement are held to be unreasonable, arbitrary, or against public policy, such covenants will be considered divisible with respect to scope, time, and geographic area, and in such lesser scope, time and geographic area, will be effective, binding and enforceable against the Employee. 

11. Arbitration. Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration, conducted before a single arbitrator selected mutually by NYB and Employee, which arbitration shall be conducted within the State of New York in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. 

12. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

13. Termination. This Agreement shall be terminated and shall have no further force or effect if, and at such time as, the Merger Agreement is terminated. 



 

E-3 The parties hereto have executed and delivered this Noncompetition Agreement
as of the date first written above.

E-4 EXHIBIT F

May 13, 2007

Mr. John S. Fiore

310 North Avenue East

Cranford, NJ 07016

Dear Mr. Fiore:

In connection with the anticipated merger (the "Merger") of Synergy Financial
Group, Inc. (the "Company") with and into New York Community Bancorp, Inc.
("NYB") as contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May
13, 2007, by and between NYB and the Company (the "Merger Agreement"), which
is entered into as of today, the Company, NYB and you hereby enter into this
agreement (this "Agreement"). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined
in this Agreement shall have the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement.

1. Effective Time Payment. __ Subject to Paragraph 4 below, at the Effective Time, the Company or NYB shall pay you $1,090,000. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, you agree that this payment and the payment described in Paragraph 2 below, shall not be taken into account in computing any benefits under any plan, program or arrangement of the Company or its Affiliates in which you participate or to which you are a party. Not later that 10 business days prior to the scheduled payment date, NYB shall be provided with sufficient information by the Company to enable its Tax Advisor (as defined below) to determine whether such payment is in compliance with Paragraph 4 of this Agreement and to make any adjustments authorized by Paragraph 4. 

2. Settlement of SERP Obligation. __ Subject to Paragraph 4 below, at the Effective Time, you agree to accept a payment of $883,000 in full satisfaction of all obligations of the Company and NYB under your Supplement Retirement Plan for John S. Fiore. The foregoing action shall not affect your rights under the Executive Life Insurance Agreement under the Salary Continuation Agreement for John S. Fiore (with a death benefit of $2 million) and a separate life insurance benefit under the Executive Life Insurance Agreement (with a death benefit of $1,170,000), each of which shall remain in effect in accordance with their terms. 

3. Termination of Prior Agreements; Agreement to Remain Employed Through Effective Time. You hereby agree that, in consideration for entering into this Agreement, effective as of the date hereof, the separate Employment Agreements by and between the Company, Synergy Bank and you, dated as of January 1, 2005 and the Supplemental Retirement Plan for John S. Fiore, shall be null and void and no person or entity shall be obligated to pay you or any person any amounts or provide any benefits in respect to such Agreements. Further, in consideration of the benefits conferred upon you pursuant to this Agreement, you hereby agree not to terminate your employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates prior to the Effective Time, and, prior to the Effective Time, the Company agrees not to terminate your employment with the Company or its Affiliates without the prior written consent of NYB. 

4. Withholding and Reduction. The Company will withhold and deposit all federal, state and local income and employment taxes that are owed with respect to all amounts paid or benefits provided to or for you by the Company, NYB or any Affiliate pursuant to this Agreement. 

 

It is the intention of the parties that no payment be made or benefit be
provided to you under this Agreement or otherwise that would constitute
an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and any regulations  



 

F-1  thereunder, thereby resulting in a loss of an income tax deduction by the
Company or NYB or the imposition of an excise tax on you under Section 4999
of the Code. If, at any time, the Tax Advisor (as defined below) determines
that some or all of the payments or benefits scheduled to be made or provided
under this Agreement, when combined with any other payments or benefits
provided to you by NYB, the Company and/or any Affiliate required to be
aggregated with NYB or the Company under Section 280G of the Code, would
constitute nondeductible excess parachute payments under Section 280G of the
Code, then the payments or benefits scheduled under this Agreement will be
reduced to the maximum amount which may be paid or provided without causing
any such payments or benefits scheduled under to be nondeductible. The
determination made as to the reduction of benefits or payments required
hereunder by the Tax Advisor shall be binding on the parties, unless within 15
days after such determination, a reputable tax advisor retained by you
disputes such determination in writing. If the two (2) tax advisors cannot
resolve the dispute within five (5) business days, they shall jointly appoint
a third tax advisor to make the final determination. If a dispute arises, the
joint determination of the two (2) tax advisors or the determination of the
third tax advisor, as applicable, shall be binding on the parties. You shall
have the right to designate within a reasonable period which payments or
benefits scheduled under this Agreement will be reduced; provided, however,
that if you do not provide such direction, the Company will implement any
necessary reductions in its discretion. For purposes of this paragraph, "Tax
Advisor" shall mean a law firm, benefits consulting firm or independent
accounting firm (which firm may be NYBs independent auditors) appointed by
NYB to make the determination required by this paragraph.

5. Successors. This Agreement is personal to you and without the prior written consent of the Company shall not be assignable by you otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by your legal representatives. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Company, NYB, and their successors and assigns. 

6. Waiver. Failure of the Company or NYB to demand strict compliance with any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such term, covenant or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment of any such term, covenant or condition on any occasion or multiple occasions be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of such term, covenant or condition. 

7. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. The Agreement is governed by and construed under the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of laws rules. You, the Company and NYB (i) hereby consent to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of any Federal court located in the State of New York or any court of the State of New York in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) hereby waive any right to challenge jurisdiction or venue in such courts with regard to any suit, action, or proceeding under or in connection with the Agreement. Each party to this Agreement also hereby waives any right to trial by jury in connection with any suit, action, or proceeding under or in connection with this Agreement. 

8. Entire and Final Agreement. Except for the Noncompetition Agreement and the Retention Agreement entered into between you and NYB and New York Community Bank, respectively dated as of the date hereof, this Agreement shall supersede any and all prior oral or written representations, understandings and agreements of the parties with respect to the matters addressed herein and it contains the entire agreement of the parties with respect to those matters. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not set forth expressly in this Agreement. Once signed by the parties hereto, no provision of this Agreement may be modified or amended unless agreed to in a writing, signed by you and a duly authorized officer of the Company and NYB. Notwithstanding anything in this  



 

F-2  Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall terminate _ab initio_
without further action by the parties if the Merger Agreement is terminated. 

9. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, obligations or interests arising hereunder may be assigned by you. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, obligations or interests arising hereunder may be assigned by the Company without your prior written consent, to a person or entity other than an affiliate or parent entity of the Company or its successors or assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event of the merger, consolidation, transfer, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company with or to any other individual or entity, this Agreement shall, subject to the provisions hereof, be binding upon and inure to the benefit of such successor and such successor shall discharge and perform all the promises, covenants, duties, and obligations of the Company hereunder. 

 

10. Section Headings. The section headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for purposes of convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

11. Notices. All notices required by this Agreement shall be sent in writing and delivered by one party to the other by overnight express mail to the following persons and addresses:
