ARTICLE III.

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

Section 3.01. _Conversion of Securities_. At and as of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company or the Company Stockholders (other than any requisite
approval of the principal terms of the Merger by the Company Stockholders in
accordance with the DGCL):

 

(a) Each Company Share held in treasury and each Company Share that is owned,
directly or indirectly, by a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, without any conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(b) Each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.01(a))_, shall (i) be converted and exchanged automatically
into the right to receive 0.27 shares of Parent Common Stock (such ratio, the
" _Exchange Ratio_ "), payable to the holder thereof, in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.02_, (ii) no longer be outstanding, (iii) automatically be
cancelled and (iv) cease to exist. Each holder of any such converted and
cancelled Company Share shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest. The
Company Shares that are to be so converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration are referred to herein as the " _Merger Shares_."

(c) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

 



14 Section 3.02. _Payment of Merger Consideration; Surrender of Company Shares;
Stock Transfer Books_.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall appoint as
exchange agent a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of paying the Merger Consideration
to Company Stockholders. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Merger Shares,
shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in non-certificated book entry
form) sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be
issued in accordance with this Agreement. Parent shall promptly deposit with
the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid in consideration thereof pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.02(j)_ and any dividends or other distributions which a
holder of Company Shares has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.02(i)_. All shares representing Parent Common Stock and cash deposited with
the Exchange Agent are hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."
Parent will instruct the Exchange Agent to pay the Merger Consideration out of
the Exchange Fund in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and the
Exchange Fund will not be used for any purpose other than the payment of the
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares, dividends and other
distributions in accordance with this _ARTICLE III_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any consideration payable in respect of Company Stock Options,
Company RSUs and/or Company PSUs will not be deposited with the Exchange Agent
but will instead be paid in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 3.03_.

 

(b) The cash portion of the Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange
Agent as directed by Parent; provided that (i) such investments will be in
obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of America or rated A-1 or
P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors
Corporation, respectively, and (ii) no gain or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to the holders of Merger Shares following completion of the
Merger pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_ and Parent shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Exchange Fund includes at all times cash
sufficient to satisfy Parents obligation under this _ARTICLE III_. Subject to
Parents obligations pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_ , any and all interest
and other income earned on the Exchange Fund shall promptly be paid to Parent
or an Affiliate of Parent as directed by Parent.

 

(c) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record of Merger Shares (other than The Depository Trust Company or its
nominee (" _DTC_ ")) as of the Effective Time (and, to the extent commercially
practicable, Parent will, or will cause the Exchange Agent to, make available
for collection by hand, during customary business hours commencing immediately
after the Effective Time, if so elected by any such holder) (i) a letter of
transmittal (each such letter, a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall be
in customary form approved by the Company) and (ii) instructions thereto for
use in effecting the surrender of certificates representing Merger Shares (the
" _Company Share Certificates_ ") and uncertificated Merger Shares held of
record in book entry form (" _Uncertificated Company Shares_ ") in exchange
for the Merger Consideration, including cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.02(j)_.

 

(d) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of (i) Company Share Certificates or
(ii) Uncertificated Company Shares in compliance with the procedures set
forth in the Letter of Transmittal and instructions thereto, together with a
Letter of Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Company Share
Certificates or Uncertificated Company Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, (A) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which
shall be in non-certificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is
specifically requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_ and (B) the amount of cash such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_. DTC, upon surrender
of the Merger Shares held of record by it in accordance with the customary
surrender procedures of DTC and the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to

 



15  receive as promptly as practicable in exchange for each surrendered Merger
Share, (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock that DTC has the
right to receive pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_ and (ii) the amount of cash
DTC has the right to receive pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_. Each Merger Share
surrendered pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.02(d)_ will be cancelled. No
interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash in lieu of fractional shares
payable to holders of Company Share Certificates or Uncertificated Company
Shares, or any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of
Company Share Certificates or Uncertificated Company Shares. No Person
beneficially owning Company Shares through DTC will be required to deliver a
Letter of Transmittal to receive the Merger Consideration. Any such Person
will receive its Merger Consideration in accordance with the customary payment
procedures of DTC following the Effective Time.

 

(e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Merger Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of the applicable Merger Shares may be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Company Share Certificates or
the Uncertificated Company Shares so surrendered are registered if such
Company Share Certificates shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Company Shares shall be
properly documented for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall
pay any transfer Tax or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration in respect thereof or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _
3.02_, each Company Share Certificate or Uncertificated Company Share shall be
deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration.

 

(f) If any Company Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Company Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Company Share Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in
respect of Merger Shares to which such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Share
Certificate relates the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled.

(g) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Merger
Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Company Share Certificates or Uncertificated Company
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation or by applicable Law.

 

(h) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders
of Merger Shares for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered
to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of Merger Shares
who have not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE III_ shall thereafter
look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and the Surviving Corporation
shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration
(and Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Surviving
Corporation has or has access to sufficient funds and shares of Parent Common
Stock to make such payments). Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Merger Shares as of a date which is immediately prior
to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. None of Parent, the
Exchange Agent or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of
Merger Shares for any such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 



16 (i) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Company Shares until such Company Shares are surrendered as
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 3.02_. Following such surrender, subject to
the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, there shall be paid,
without interest, to the record holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock,
if any, issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, all
dividends and other distributions payable in respect of any such shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment
date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender.
For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of shares
of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time.

 

(j) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Shares.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Merger
Shares who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after taking into account all Company Shares (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) surrendered by such holder) shall be
entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 3.02(j)_, in lieu of such fractional shares, cash in
the amount equal to such fractional amount _multiplied by_ the Parent Common
Stock Price.

Section 3.03. _Treatment of Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and Company
PSUs_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering any Company Equity Plan) will adopt
resolutions, and the Company will take all other actions as may be necessary
or required in accordance with applicable Law and each Company Equity Plan
(including, the award agreements in respect of awards granted thereunder)
to give effect to this _Section_ __ _ 3.03_ to provide that:

(a) Each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of any holder
of any Company Stock Option be cancelled and, in exchange therefor,
converted into the right to receive an amount of cash, if any, equal to the
product of (i) the number of Company Shares issuable upon the exercise of the
Company Stock Option, _multiplied by_ (ii) the excess, if any, of the (A) the
Company Equity Award Consideration and (B) the exercise price of the Company
Stock Option. For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Stock Option with an
exercise price equal to or in excess of the Company Equity Award Consideration
shall, automatically and without any action on the part of any holder of any
Company Stock Option, be cancelled without any action on the part of the
holder thereof and without any payment to the holder thereof. As soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay
to each holder of a Company Stock Option, the consideration (if any) required
to be paid to such holder pursuant to this _ Section_ __ _ 3.03(a)_, subject
to  _Section_ __ _ 3.05_.

(b) Each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, shall, automatically and without any action
on the part of any holder of any Company RSU, be cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, converted into the right to receive an amount of cash (without
interest) equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Shares in respect
of the Company RSU, _multiplied by_ (ii) the Company Equity Award
Consideration. As soon as practicable

 



17  following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall pay to each holder of such Company RSUs the consideration
required to be paid to any such holder pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
3.03(b)_, subject to _Section_ __ _ 3.05_; provided, however, that to the
extent that any such Company RSU constitutes nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, such cash payment shall be
paid in accordance with the applicable awards terms and at the earliest time
permitted under the terms of such award that will not result in the
application of a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(c) Each Company PSU that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, vest, and the
underlying number of Company Shares earned be determined, based on the maximum
level of achievement of the applicable performance goals. All Company PSUs
that are vested immediately prior to the Effective Time or vest pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_ shall, automatically and without any action on
the part of any holder of any Company PSU, be cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, converted into the right to receive an amount of cash (without
interest) equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Shares earned in
respect of the Company PSU (as determined pursuant to the preceding
sentences), _multiplied by_ (ii) the Company Equity Award Consideration. As
soon as practicable following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall pay to each holder of such Company PSUs the consideration required to be
paid to any such holder pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.03(c)_, subject
to _Section_ __ _ 3.05_; provided, however, that to the extent that any such
Company PSU constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section
409A of the Code, such cash payment shall be paid in accordance with the
applicable awards terms and at the earliest time permitted under the terms of
such award that will not result in the application of a Tax or penalty under
Section 409A of the Code. 

(d) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Company Equity
Awards that are outstanding as of the Effective Time in accordance with the
terms of this _Section_ __ _ 3.03_ and sponsorship of each Company Equity
Plan, provided that references to the Company therein shall thereupon be
deemed references to Parent and references to Company Common Stock therein
shall be deemed references to Parent Common Stock with appropriate equitable
adjustments to reflect the Transactions. At least 15 days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to the holders of the Company Equity
Awards notices, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent,
setting forth the treatment of the Company Equity Awards pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

Section 3.04. _No Appraisal Rights_. In accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to Company Stockholders or any
other holder of Company Shares in connection with the Merger.

Section 3.05. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any other payment otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Shares, Company
Stock Options, Company RSUs or Company PSUs, as applicable, such amounts or
securities as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. Any applicable Tax withholdings with respect to the
consideration payable to a holder of Company Stock Options, Company RSUs or
Company PSUs, as applicable, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.03_ shall be
withheld and reduce the amounts payable in respect of such holders Company
Stock Options, Company RSUs, or Company PSUs, as applicable. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as appropriate,
shall provide commercially reasonable notice to the Company upon becoming
aware of any such withholding obligation (other than with respect to Company
Stock Options, Company RSUs or Company PSUs) and shall cooperate with the
Company to the extent reasonable to obtain reduction of or relief from such
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so

 



18  withheld and timely paid over to or deposited with the applicable
Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Shares, Company
Stock Options, Company RSUs or Company PSUs, as applicable, in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as applicable.

 

Section 3.06. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Notwithstanding any provision
of this _ARTICLE III_ to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement
and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, split, combination, exchange of
shares or similar transaction, the Merger Consideration and any other
similarly dependent item, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted
to reflect fully the effect of such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction and to provide the holders of Company Shares the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided,
however, that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 3.06_ shall be construed as
permitting the Company to take any action or enter into any transaction
otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

 

Section 3.07. _Tax Characterization of Merger_. The Company and Parent each
acknowledges and agrees that for U.S. federal income Tax purposes the Merger
is intended to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. Each of the Company and Parent shall report the Merger in
accordance with the foregoing and shall not take any position inconsistent
therewith unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the
meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

 

ARTICLE IV.

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except (a) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter or (b) as set forth
in the Company SEC Reports filed from and after April 10, 2017 and prior to
the date of this Agreement (excluding all disclosures in any "Risk Factors"
section and any disclosures included in any such Company SEC Reports that are
forward looking in nature), but only to the extent such disclosure is
reasonably apparent from a reading of such Company SEC Reports that such
disclosure is relevant to such Section of _ ARTICLE_ __ _ IV_ below, the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

Section 4.01. _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
State of Delaware and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own,
operate and lease its properties and assets and carry on its business as now
conducted. The Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a
foreign corporation and is, to the extent applicable, in good standing under
the Laws of any other jurisdiction in which the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it therein or in which the conduct or nature of
its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



19 Section 4.02. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 

(a) The Company has made available to Parent copies of the Company Certificate
and Company Bylaws, and the copies of such documents are complete and correct

Company Stockholders and meetings of or action by the Company Board and each

of the Companys Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, trust or other organization that is duly
incorporated or organized, validly existing and, to the extent applicable, in
good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, except where the failure to be in good standing would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Companys Subsidiaries has the requisite
corporate, limited partnership, limited liability company or similar power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Companys
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
owned, leased or operated by it or the conduct or nature of its business makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except for jurisdictions in which
the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The Company is, directly or indirectly, the record and beneficial owner of
all of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of
each of its Subsidiaries. Other than as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.03(b)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter, all of such shares and other equity
interests so owned by the Company are validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable and are owned by it free and clear of any Liens or
limitations on voting rights, are free of preemptive rights and were issued in
compliance with applicable Law. There are no subscriptions, options, warrants,

outstanding security or other instrument) for any of the capital stock or
other equity interests of, or other ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of
the Company. There are no agreements requiring the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to make contributions to the capital of, or lend or
advance funds to, any Subsidiary of the Company or any other Person.

Disclosure Letter, no Subsidiary of the Company has (i) any legal or
beneficial ownership interest in any Company Shares, (ii) a minimum cash
capitalization or other cash reserve requirement set by Law, Contract or

to the United States of America.

been, in compliance with all Laws applicable to them, any of their properties
or other assets or any of their businesses or operations, except where any
such failure to be in compliance would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. To
the Knowledge of the Company, since February 1, 2015, no Governmental
Authority has issued any notice or notification stating that the Company or

to carry on their businesses as currently conducted (collectively, "
_Permits_ ") and each such material Permit is in full force and effect. Since
February 1, 2015, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received

from any Governmental Authority or, to the Knowledge of the Company, from any
employee, licensee, licensor, vendor or supplier of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that alleges that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is not

Liability under, any Permit that is material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or relating to the revocation or modification

whole. The consummation of the Transactions, in and of itself, will not cause
the revocation or cancellation of any Permit that is material to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(c) With respect to each material Government Contract and Government Bid, (i)
each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material
respects with all requirements of Law pertaining to such Government Contract
or Government Bid, (ii) each representation and certification executed by the

no suspension, stop work order, cure notice or show cause notice in effect for
such Government Contract nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, is any
Governmental Authority threatening to issue one.

criminal investigation, indictment, writ of information or audit of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Governmental Authority with respect
to any alleged or potential violation of Law regarding any material
Government Contract or Government Bid; (ii) suspension or debarment
proceeding, nor any matters pending reasonably likely to lead to a suspension
or debarment proceeding, against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or
(iii) contracting officers decision or legal proceeding by which a
Governmental Authority claims that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
liable to a Governmental Authority, in each case, with respect to any
material Government Contract. Since February 1, 2015, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries,
directors, officers nor, to the Companys Knowledge, employees has conducted
or initiated any internal investigation, or made a voluntary disclosure to any
Governmental Authority, with respect to any alleged material misstatement or
omission arising under or relating to any material Government Contract or
Government Bid.

of ERISA, has occurred with respect to the Plans that could reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in material Liability to
the Company. Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS or is
entitled to rely on a favorable opinion issued by the IRS, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no fact or event has occurred since the date of such

27  any of the trusts under such Plan or the plan administrator, or against any
fiduciary of any Plan with respect to the operation of the Plan (except
routine claims for benefits payable under the Plans) other than any such

penalty, Tax or Liability of any kind imposed under ERISA, the Code or
applicable Law.

 

(d) Except as disclosed in _Section_ __ _ 4.12(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates, contributes to, has contributed to during the past six (6)
years, or otherwise participates in or has any Liability with respect to any
(i) defined benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA), whether or
not subject to ERISA, (ii) Multiemployer Plan or (iii) multiple employer plan
subject to Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA.

Company or its Subsidiaries under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code
(" _ERISA Affiliate_ ") have terminated any a defined benefit plan, or
incurred any outstanding Liability under Section 4062 of ERISA to the Pension
Benefits Guaranty Corporation or to a trustee appointed under Section 4042 of
ERISA. No event has occurred and no condition exists that would subject the
Company or its Subsidiaries, including by reason of its affiliation with any
ERISA Affiliate, to any material Liability imposed under Title IV of ERISA or
Code Section 412 other than premium payments to the PBGC. Each Plan that is
subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code is
listed on Section 4.12(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter and: (i) each such

(iv) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate such Plan; and (v)

aggregate, result in material Liability to the Company, there has not been
any "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA)
during the last six years as to which the 30-day advance notice requirement
has not been waived.

 

(f) With respect to each Multiemployer Plan to which the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has an obligation to contribute

the Knowledge of the Company, no conditions or circumstances exist that could

in respect of any such Multiemployer Plan; and (iii) none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliates would incur any withdrawal Liability

meaning of Part 1 of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) on or prior to the
Closing Date from each Multiemployer Plan to which such entity has any
obligation to contribute on the date of this Agreement.

directors, or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries except as
may be required under Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or state insurance laws.

(h) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.12(h)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, no Plan or other arrangement maintained by the Company or any
Subsidiary, either individually or collectively, exists that, as a result of
the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions,
whether alone or together with any other event(s), could (i) result in any
payment (including severance, deferred compensation, Tax gross-up, retention,
bonus or other payment) becoming due under any of the Plans or other
arrangements, (ii) result in the acceleration or increase in any payment or
benefit, the vesting or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of

jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned, leased or

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.02. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. Parent has made
available to the Company copies of the Parent Certificate and Parent Bylaws,
and the copies of such documents are complete and correct and contain all

portions thereof that relate only to the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company) will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty with respect to
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or

extensions actually obtained) and such Tax Returns are true, complete, and
correct in all respects.

 



45 (ii) All Taxes due and owing by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries have been
timely paid. The unpaid Taxes of Parent and its Subsidiaries did not, as of

or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, audits, assessments or other
actions for or relating to any liability in respect of Taxes of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries. Within the two-year period ending on the date of this
Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has distributed the
stock of any corporation, or had its stock distributed, in a transaction
intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 355 of the Code.

(b) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or agreed to take
any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Merger
from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is aware of any
agreement, plan, fact or other circumstance that would reasonably be expected
to prevent or impede (i) the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (ii) Parent from obtaining
the Parent Tax Opinion.

Section 5.17. _Employee Plans_.

 

(a) Each Parent Plan has been established, maintained, operated and

non-exempt "prohibited transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the
Code and Section 406 of ERISA, has occurred with respect to the Parent Plans
that could, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result
in material Liability to Parent. Each Parent Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS or is entitled to rely on a favorable
opinion issued by the IRS, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no fact or event
has occurred since the date of such determination letter which could
reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of such letter. There are
no investigations by any Governmental Authority, termination proceedings or
other claims or litigation, pending or to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened
or for which there are facts that could form a reasonable basis, against or
relating to any Parent Plan or asserting any rights to or claims for benefits
under any Parent Plan, the assets or any of the trusts under such Parent Plan
or the plan administrator, or against any fiduciary of any Parent Plan with
respect to the operation of the Parent Plan (except routine claims for
benefits payable under the Parent Plans) other than any such investigations,
proceedings or claims that would not reasonably be expected to, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All contributions,
premiums and benefit payments under or in connection with the Parent Plans
that are required to have been made as the date of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of the Parent Plans or applicable Law have been
timely made in all material respects. There has been no act, omission or
condition with respect to any Parent Plan that would be reasonably likely to
subject Parent or its Subsidiaries to any material fine, penalty, Tax or
Liability of any kind imposed under ERISA, the Code or applicable Law.

(b) With respect to each Parent Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section
302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code and except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect: (i) each such Parent Plan satisfies all minimum

 



46  funding requirements under Sections 412, 430 and 431 of the Code and
Sections 302, 303 and 304 of ERISA, whether or not waived; (ii) no Lien in
favor of any such Parent Plan has arisen under Section 430(k) of the Code or
Section 303(k) of ERISA; (iii) such Parent Plan is not in "at risk status"
within the meaning of Section 430(i) of the Code or Section 303(i) of ERISA;
(iv) no event has occurred and no condition exists that would subject Parent
or its Subsidiaries, including by reason of its affiliation with any ERISA
Affiliate of Parent, to any material Liability imposed under Title IV of ERISA
or Code Section 412 other than the premium payments to the PBGC; (v) the PBGC
has not instituted proceedings to terminate such Parent Plan; and (vi), there
has not been any "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043
of ERISA) during the last six years as to which the 30-day advance notice
requirement has not been waived.

(c) With respect to each Multiemployer Plan to which Parent, its Subsidiaries
or any ERISA Affiliate of Parent has an obligation to contribute or otherwise
participates in or has any Liability, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect: (i) to the Knowledge of Parent, no such Multiemployer Plan (A) is in
endangered status (under Section 432(b)(1) of the Code or Section 305(b)(1) of
ERISA), (B) is in critical status (under Section 432(b)(2) of the Code or
Section 305(b)(2) of ERISA), or (C) has requested or been granted by the IRS
any waiver of the minimum funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA and
Section 412 of the Code; (ii) none of Parent, its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA
Affiliates of Parent has received, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no
conditions or circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to result
in, a notice of endangered or critical status pursuant to Section
432(b)(3)(D) of the Code or Section 305(b)(3)(D) of ERISA in respect of any
such Multiemployer Plan; and (iii) none of Parent, its Subsidiaries nor any
ERISA Affiliates would incur any withdrawal Liability (within the meaning of
Part 1 of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) if any of Parent, its Subsidiaries
or any ERISA Affiliates withdrew (within the meaning of Part 1 of Subtitle E
of Title IV of ERISA) on or prior to the Closing Date from each Multiemployer
Plan to which such entity has any obligation to contribute on the date of this
Agreement.

(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any material obligation or Liability (contingent or
otherwise) to provide post-retirement life insurance or health benefits
coverage for current or former officers, directors, or employees of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries except as may be required under Part 6 of Title I of
ERISA or state insurance laws.

 

(e) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i) each Parent Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A of the
Code) has been maintained in material compliance with Section 409A of the Code
and the rules and regulations thereunder in both operation and documentation
and (ii) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries have any indemnity or
gross-up obligations for any Taxes imposed under Section 409A of the Code.

 

(f) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each Parent Plan that is
primarily for the benefit of current or former employees, officers, directors
or consultants of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries who are located outside of
the United States (i) has been maintained, operated and funded in all
material respects in accordance with all applicable Law, (ii) if it is
intended to qualify for special tax treatment, has met all material
requirements for such treatment and (iii) if it is intended to be funded
and/or book reserved, is fully funded and/or book reserved, based on
reasonable actuarial assumptions, where applicable.

 



47 Section 5.18. _Environmental Matters_. Except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, (a) there are no investigations or Actions (whether administrative or
judicial) pending or threatened in writing, alleging noncompliance with or
Liability under any Environmental Law, (b) Parent and its Subsidiaries are,
and except for matters that have been fully resolved with the applicable
Governmental Authority, since February 1, 2015 have been, in compliance with

under applicable Environmental Laws to conduct their respective business and
operations as currently conducted, and compliance with the terms and
conditions thereof), (c) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries have

Property or Parent Leased Real Property that has not been remediated, and

of any environmental Permit by, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (d) there
has been no disposal or arrangement of disposal by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries at any other location in violation of Environmental Law or in

Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. § 9601 et
seq. or any foreign or state remedial priority list promulgated or maintained

actions necessary in accordance with applicable Law, Orders and the Company
Certificate and the Company Bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold (on a date selected by the Company and reasonably acceptable to Parent,
which date shall in no event be later than 45 days following the date the
Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC for mailing to the
Company Stockholders) a special meeting of the Company Stockholders (the "
_Company Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_ ") solely for the purpose of obtaining
the Company Stockholder Approval and, if applicable, the advisory vote
required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection therewith.
The Company shall, through the Company Board, make the Company Board
Recommendation, include such Company Board Recommendation in the

use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and
otherwise secure the vote or consent of the Company Stockholders as required
by the rules of NASDAQ, the DGCL or other applicable Law to effect the
Merger, except, in each case, during such time as a valid Adverse
Recommendation Change is in effect. The Company shall give Parent no less than
10 Business Days advance notice (or such shorter period of time as notice is
provided to NASDAQ) of the date which shall be set as the "record date" for
the Company Stockholders eligible to vote at the Company Stockholders
Meeting. The Company may, without the prior consent of Parent, make one or
more successive postponements or adjournments of the Company Stockholders
Meeting (i) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement
required under applicable Law is timely provided to Company Stockholders
within a reasonable amount of time, in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board (after consultation with its outside counsel and Parent), in advance of
the Company Stockholders Meeting, (ii) if required by applicable Law or a
request from the SEC or its staff or (iii) if, on a date for which the Company
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of Company Shares to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present; provided that (A)
the duration of any such adjournment or postponement shall be limited to the
minimum duration reasonably necessary to remedy the circumstances giving rise
to such adjournment or postponement, (B) no single such adjournment or
postponement shall be for more than five Business Days except as may be
required by federal securities Laws, and (C) in the case of clause (iii), the
Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be postponed to later than the date
that is ten Business Days after the date for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting was originally scheduled without the prior written consent of Parent.
All other postponements or adjournments shall require the prior written
consent of Parent. The Company shall ensure that the Company Stockholders
Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all Persons
solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited,
in compliance with all applicable Laws and Orders.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) in no event will the
Companys obligations pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ be affected by
the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company or any other Person of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such
Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal) or the occurrence of an
Intervening Event and (ii) unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, (A) the Companys obligation to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting will not be
affected by the occurrence of an Adverse Recommendation Change and (B) the
Company shall not submit to the vote of the Company Stockholders any
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) prior to the vote
of the Company Stockholders with respect to the Merger at the Company
Stockholders Meeting.

 



55 Section 6.05. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, from the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries
and the Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to, afford Parent
and Merger Sub, and their respective Representatives, reasonable access during
normal working hours upon reasonable advance notice to the officers,
employees, agents, assets, properties, offices, plants and other facilities,
books and records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _ provided_,
_however_ , that none of Parent or Merger Sub, or their respective
Representatives, may access or enter onto any property, office, plant or
other facility, or otherwise inquire about or investigate the Companys or any
of its Subsidiaries operations, for purposes of conducting any environmental
site visit, assessment, investigation (including any testing, sampling or
intrusive measures) without the prior, express written consent of the Company.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ to the contrary, the
Company may withhold any document or information the disclosure of which (i)
would cause a violation of applicable Law or (ii) would be reasonably likely
to risk a loss of legal privilege (provided that the Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure (or as much as
possible) in a manner that would not be reasonably likely to risk a loss of
legal privilege). If any material is withheld by the Company pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, it will, to the extent possible without
violating Law or risking a loss of legal privilege, inform Parent as to the
general nature of what is being withheld. All information obtained by Parent
or its Representatives pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_ will be held
confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement,
dated November 15, 2016 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between the
Company and Parent. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, Parent
shall not be required to provide to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective Representatives, before, on or after the Closing Date, any
right to access or to review any Tax Return or Tax workpaper of Parent or any
of its Affiliates (other than of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period).

 

Section 6.06. _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives
to, immediately (i) cease and terminate, or cause to be terminated, any and
all discussions, solicitations, encouragements or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry,
proposal or request for information that may reasonably be expected to lead
to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) terminate all physical and electronic data
room access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives, and
(iii) request (or, to the extent the Company is contractually permitted to
do so, require) the return or destruction of all copies of confidential
information previously provided to such Persons by or on behalf of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or Representatives. From the date of this Agreement
until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.06(b)_,
the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives
not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, cause or knowingly
facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information) the
submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers or any other efforts or
attempts that constitute or may reasonably be expected to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, or engage in any discussions or negotiations with
respect thereto or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or
knowingly facilitate or encourage, any such inquiries, proposals, discussions
or negotiations, or resolve to or publicly propose to take any of the
foregoing actions, (ii) approve or recommend, or resolve to or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or enter into

any letter of intent, agreement or agreement-in-principle requiring the
Company (whether or not subject to conditions) to abandon, terminate or fail
to consummate the Merger or (iii) (A) withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub the Company Board Recommendation or the
approval or declaration of advisability by the Company Board of this Agreement
and the Transactions (including the Merger) or (B) approve or recommend, or
resolve to or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal (any action described in clause (A) or (B) being referred to as an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
6.06(a)_, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time, (i) the Company has received from a third party a written,
bona fide Acquisition Proposal, (ii) a breach by the Company of this _Section_
__ _ 6.06_ has not contributed to the making of such Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (iv)
after consultation with its outside counsel, the Company Board determines in
good faith that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law, then the
Company may, subject to clauses (x), (y) and (z) below, (A) furnish
confidential information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
regarding such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that the
Company (x) will not, and will not allow its Representatives to, disclose any
non-public information to such Person unless the Company first enters into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person, (y) will promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours) provide to Parent notice of its intention to
enter into such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (z) will provide to
Parent prior to or substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to
such Person any non-public information not previously provided to Parent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _ 6.06(a)_
or in this _Section_ __ _ 6.06(b)_, the Company may, following the receipt
of an Acquisition Proposal or an inquiry, proposal or request for information
that may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, contact
the Person that has made such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or
request to clarify the terms and conditions thereof solely to the extent
necessary to enable the Company Board to determine whether such Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry, proposal or request constitutes or is reasonably likely to
lead to, or result in, a Superior Proposal, and to inform such Person of the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_.

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
Parent, orally and in writing, in the event that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal or
indication by any Person that it is considering making an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information in contemplation of an
Acquisition Proposal relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
(iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) with the identity of such Person and a copy of such
Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (or, where such
Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, a written description of the Companys
understanding of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, indication, inquiry or request), including any modifications
thereto. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis
(and in any event no later than 24 hours after the occurrence of any material
changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of any
Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (including the material
terms and conditions thereof and of any material modification thereto), and
any developments, discussions and negotiations, including furnishing copies
of any written inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation, and written
summaries of any material oral inquiries or discussions. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
notify Parent

 



57  orally and in writing if it determines to begin providing information or to
engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 6.06(b)_ and shall in no event begin
providing such information or engaging in such discussions or negotiations
prior to providing such notice. The Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and Representatives not to, enter into any Contract with any
Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement that would restrict the
Companys ability to provide such information relating to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to Parent, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is currently party to any Contract that prohibits the Company
from providing the information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries described in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.06(c)_ to Parent. The
Company (i) shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, terminate,
waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission or request under,
any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is or becomes a party and (ii) shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to enforce the provisions of any
such agreement.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in _Section_ __ _ 6.06(a)_ to the contrary, if
(i) the Company receives from a third party a written, bona fide Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) a breach by the Company of this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_ has not
contributed to the making of such Acquisition Proposal and (iii) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments to the terms
of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent, including pursuant to
clause (III) below, the Company Board may at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, if it determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to take such action would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable Law, (x) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (y)
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless (A) in advance of or concurrently with such
termination the Company pays the Termination Fee to Parent in immediately
available funds and (B) concurrently with or immediately thereafter such
termination enters into the Alternative Acquisition Agreement; _provided_ _,_
_further_ _,_ _however_ , that the Company Board may not effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless (I) the Company shall
not have breached this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_, (II) the Company shall have
provided prior written notice to Parent, at least five Business Days in
advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to take such action with
respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of
the party making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously
provided to Parent a copy of any proposed definitive agreement(s) with respect
to such Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), (III)
prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this
Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial
advisors, outside counsel and other Representatives to, during the Notice
Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal and (IV) following any negotiation described in the immediately
preceding clause (III), such Acquisition Proposal (provided that the Company
shall have complied with the provisions of the immediately following
sentence) continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any
material revisions to the terms of an Acquisition Proposal after the start of
the Notice Period, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _
6.06(d)_ with respect to such new written notice, and the Notice Period shall
be deemed to have re-commenced on the date of such new notice.

 



58 (e) Notwithstanding anything in _Section_ __ _ 6.06(a)_ to the contrary,
if (i) a material development or change in circumstances in the business,
results of operations or financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (other than and not related to an Acquisition Proposal) that was
neither known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board (assuming,
for such purpose, reasonable consultation with the executive officers of the
Company) on or prior to the date of this Agreement occurs or arises after the
date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval (such development or change, an " _Intervening Event_ "), (ii) the
Intervening Event did not result or arise from a breach of any provision of
this Agreement and (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of the existence of such
Intervening Event, the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable Law, the Company Board may, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change,
provided that the Company Board shall not make an Adverse Recommendation
Change in light of the existence of such Intervening Event unless (A) the
Company has provided to Parent at least four Business Days prior written
notice of its intention to take such action with respect to such Intervening
Event, which notice shall specify, in reasonable detail, the facts underlying
the Company Boards determination that an Intervening Event has occurred and
the rationale and basis for such Adverse Recommendation Change, (B) the
Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisors, outside counsel and
other Representatives to, during such four Business Day notice period,
negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so as to obviate the need for an Adverse Recommendation Change as a
result of the Intervening Event and (C) following any negotiation described in
the immediately preceding clause (B), the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make
such Adverse Recommendation Change in light of such Intervening Event (taking
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement agreed to or proposed
by Parent in connection with the negotiations required by the immediately
preceding clause (B)) would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Law. In the event of any material change
in the circumstances of such Intervening Event or the occurrence of another
Intervening Event, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _
6.06(e)_ with respect to such new written notice.

(f) The Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_ by any of its Representatives shall be deemed to
be a material breach of this Agreement (including this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_)
by the Company.

 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_ shall prohibit the Company
Board from taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that any
disclosure other than (i) a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication
of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (ii) an
express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or (iii) an express
reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation together with a factual
description of events or actions leading up to such disclosure that have been
taken by the Company and that are permitted under _Section_ __ _ 6.06_ or
actions taken or notices delivered to Parent by the Company that are required
by _Section_ __ _ 6.06_, shall, in each case, be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change (including for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 8.01(f))_.

(h) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from the provisions of
"control share acquisitions" contained in any Anti-Takeover Law or otherwise
cause such restrictions not to apply, in each case unless such actions are
taken simultaneously with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(h)_.

 



59 Section 6.07. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From the Effective Time until December 31, 2018, Parent shall cause the
compensation and benefits package provided to each employee of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Employee_ ")
to be no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation and benefits
package, in the aggregate, provided to such Company Employee as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Plans listed on
_Section_ __ _ 4.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, including for
purposes of this comparison any defined benefit plans listed on  _Section_ __
_ 4.12(d)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter and any retiree medical
benefits listed on _Section_ __ _ 4.12(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
and excluding for purposes of this comparison any equity-based compensation
and change of control, sale or similar bonuses provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) For purposes of eligibility, vesting and, solely with respect to severance
and vacation, level of benefit entitlement (but in no event for purposes of
benefit accrual or eligibility for retiree medical or other retiree welfare
benefits) under the Parent Benefit Programs, each Company Employee shall,
subject to applicable Law and applicable Tax qualification requirements, be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar Plans in which such
Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior
to the Effective Time; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits.

(c) For purposes of each Parent Benefit Program providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall cause
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements
of such Parent Benefit Program to be waived for such Company Employee and his
or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived
under a similar Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses
incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents under the Plans
during the portion of the plan year of the Parent Benefit Program ending on
the date such employees participation in the corresponding Parent Benefit
Program begins to be taken into account under such Parent Benefit Program for
purposes of satisfying all deductible and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
Parent Benefit Program.

(d) At Parents election, the Company shall terminate, effective as of the day
immediately preceding the Effective Time, any and all 401(k) Plans sponsored
or maintained by the Company. In such event, Parent shall receive from the
Company evidence that the Companys Plan(s) and/or program(s) have been
terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or a committee
thereof (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and
approval of Parent), effective as of the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time,
Parent shall permit each Company Employee who is a participant in any
terminated 401(k) Plan(s) to roll over his or her account balance(s) and
outstanding loan balance(s), if any, thereunder into a Parent Benefit Program
that is intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code.

(e) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company will notify Parent
reasonably promptly of any notice or other communication received by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from the PBGC regarding any defined benefit
pension plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and the Company will
consult with Parent with respect to any responsive communications with the
PBGC or its representatives and will not enter into any Contract with the PBGC
without Parents prior consent.

 



60 (f) Parent acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Surviving Corporation will
honor the terms of all Plans, as in effect at the Effective Time, subject to
the right of the Surviving Corporation to amend, modify or terminate such
Plans to the extent permitted by the terms thereof, and (ii) the Transactions
shall constitute a "change of control" "change in control" or similar event,
as applicable, under the terms of the Plans listed on _Section_ __ _ 6.07(f)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _
6.07_ shall (i) be treated as an amendment or establishment of any particular
Plan, Parent Benefit Program or any other benefit or compensation arrangement
of Parent, the Company or their respective Affiliates, (ii) give any third
party any right to enforce the provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.07_ or
(iii) require Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates to (A)
maintain any particular Plan or Parent Benefit Program or (B) retain the
employment of any particular employee. 

Section 6.08. _Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _Indemnification and
Insurance of the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor all of the Companys obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer
or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified
Party_ ") as provided in the Company Certificate or Company Bylaws, in each
case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other
agreements in effect on the date of this Agreement, accurate and complete
copies of which have been made available to Parent and are listed in _Section_
__ _ 6.08(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, including provisions relating
to the advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any Action or as
permitted under applicable Law. Parents obligation under this _Section_ __ _
6.08(a)_ shall survive the Merger and shall remain in full force and effect
for a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time. During such
period, Parent shall guarantee the obligations of the Surviving Corporation
with respect to any and all amounts payable under this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_.

 

(b) In addition to Parents indemnification obligations pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 6.08(a)_ above, prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase a "tail" officers and directors
liability insurance policy, which by its terms shall survive the Merger and
shall provide each Indemnified Party with coverage for not less than six
years following the Effective Time on terms and conditions no less favorable
than the terms of the directors and officers liability insurance policy
currently maintained by the Company (a correct and complete copy of which has
been delivered to Parent) (the " _D andO Insurance_") in respect of actions or
omissions of such officers and directors prior to the Effective Time in their
capacities as such; _provided_ _, _ _however_ , that in no event shall Parent
or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend more than 300% of the
current annual premium paid by the Company for such policy to purchase the
"tail" policy (the " _Maximum Amount_ "); _provided_ _,_ _further_ _,_
_however_ , that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to procure
such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent shall spend up to
the Maximum Amount to purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with
such Maximum Amount. The Indemnified Parties may be required to make
reasonable application and provide reasonable and customary representations
and warranties to applicable insurance carriers for the purpose of obtaining
such insurance.

(c) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.08_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall
not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party to whom this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ applies without the
consent of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the
Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.08_, each of whom may enforce
the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.08_).

 



61 Section 6.09. _Further Action; Efforts_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, each of the Parties shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain any consents, approvals or waivers of Governmental
Authorities, and of third parties with respect to any Contracts to which such
Party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, as may be necessary for the
consummation of the Transactions or required by the terms of any Contract as a
result of the execution, performance or consummation of the Transactions.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, prior to the Effective
Time, each Party shall, as promptly as practicable, use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to

in limitation of the foregoing, each Party shall (i) make all filings
required under the HSR Act as promptly as practicable but in no event later
than 10 Business Days after the date of this Agreement, (ii) use reasonable
best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable the termination or
expiration of any waiting period under the HSR Act prior to the Outside Date,
(iii) cooperate and consult with each other in (A) determining which material
consents, approvals, permits, notices or authorizations are required to
be obtained prior to the Effective Time from Governmental Authorities in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and related
agreements and consummation of the Transactions and (B) timely seeking all
such consents, approvals, permits, notices or authorizations.

(b) In connection with, and without limiting, the efforts referenced in 
_Section_ __ _ 6.09(a)_, each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and

other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party, (ii) keep the other party reasonably and promptly informed of
any communication received by such Party (including, to the extent not
prohibited by Law, providing copies of all written correspondence) from, or
given by such Party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other
Governmental Authority and of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding the
Transactions and (iii) permit the other Party to review any communication to
be given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or
conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and
to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable
Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other Party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in _Section_ __ _ 6.09(a)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 6.09(b)_, but
subject to the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.09(e)_, if any objections are
asserted with respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust Law or if any
suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or

Section 9.03. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy or the application of this Agreement to any Person or
circumstance is invalid or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. To such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed
to be severable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order
that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

Section 9.04. _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with
the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter, constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be
assigned, whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise.

 



71 Section 9.05. _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that money damages would not
be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, and accordingly, the
Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof,
without any requirement to post bond, in addition to any other remedy at law
or equity. The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy.

Section 9.06.  _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each Party, and nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, other than the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.08_ (which are
intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby or the Persons
entitled to payment thereunder and may be enforced by such Persons).

Section 9.07. _Governing Law; Forum_.

 

(a) All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or
the Transactions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules of conflict of laws.

 

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard
and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware). The
Parties hereby (i) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware) for the purpose of any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any Party and
(ii) irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that any such Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above-
named courts. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that mailing of process or
other papers in connection with any action or proceeding in the manner
provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.02_ or such other manner as may be permitted by
Law shall be valid and sufficient service of process.

Section 9.08. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. Each
of the Parties (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other Party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other Party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver
and (b) acknowledges that it and the other Parties have been induced to enter
into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section_ __ _ 9.08_. 

 



72 Section 9.09. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or other form of electronic transmission) in two or
more counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each
of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
