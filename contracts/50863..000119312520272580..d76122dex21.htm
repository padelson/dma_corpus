34

    

2.3 _Identity of Parties for First Closing_. If, after the Entity-to-
Entity Asset and Liability Transfer Plan is agreed by the Parties, (a) the
Buyer Parent wishes to change one or more of the Buyers identified therein,
the Buyer Parent shall have the right to designate, by written notice to the
Seller Parent not less than thirty (30) days prior to the First Closing Date,
one (1) or more of its Affiliates to purchase any or all of the First Closing
Transferred Assets and assume responsibility for any or all of the First
Closing Assumed Liabilities, by way of substitution for, or in addition to,
one (1) or more of the entities identified on the Entity-to-Entity Asset and
Liability Transfer Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer Parent shall
not have the right set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.3_ if any such
addition or substitution would, or would be reasonably likely to, (i)
prohibit, delay or impede the First Closing or (ii) result in any material
adverse tax consequence to the Seller Parent, any Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates; or (b) the Seller Parent wishes to change one or more
of the Sellers identified therein, the Seller Parent shall have the right to
amend, by written notice to the Buyer Parent not less than sixty (60) days
prior to the First Closing Date, the list of the Sellers identified on the
Entity-to-Entity Asset and Liability Transfer Plan; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that the Seller Parent shall not have the right set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 2.3_ if such amendment would, or would be reasonably likely to, (i)
prohibit, delay or impede the First Closing or (ii) result in any material
adverse tax consequence to the Buyer Parent, any Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates.

 

2.4 _First Closing Consideration_.

 

(a) _Capital Expenditure_. Attached hereto as _Schedule 2.4(a)_ is the
Seller Parents schedule of projected CapEx by fiscal quarter from the period
commencing on date of this Agreement and ending on December 31, 2021 (as it
may be supplemented pursuant to the following sentence, the " _CapEx Schedule_
"). If, as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021, the Parties
reasonably anticipate that the First Closing Date will occur after December
31, 2021, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to prepare a supplement to
the CapEx Schedule to determine the projected CapEx for each fiscal quarter
of 2022.

(b) _Purchase Price_.

 

(i) At least three (3) Business Days, but not more than five (5) Business Days
prior to the First Closing Date, the Seller Parent shall prepare and deliver
to the Buyer Parent a statement (the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth the Seller Parents good faith estimate of (A) the aggregate
amount of CapEx made by the Seller Parent and its Affiliates during the
period from the date of this Agreement through (and including) the First
Closing Date (the " _Estimated CapEx_ ") and (B) the amount of the Estimated
CapEx Adjustment, which statement shall include reasonable detail regarding
the capital expenditures made during the relevant period. The Estimated CapEx
shall be calculated in a manner consistent with the calculation methodologies
and principles used by the Seller Parent to prepare the CapEx Schedule.
During the period after the delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement and
prior to the First Closing Date, the Buyer Parent shall have an opportunity to
review the Estimated Closing Statement and the Seller Parent shall cooperate
with the Buyer Parent in good faith to mutually agree upon the Estimated
Closing Statement in the event the Buyer Parent disputes any item proposed to
be set forth on such statement; _provided_ that, if the Seller Parent and
the Buyer Parent are not able to reach mutual agreement prior to the First
Closing Date, the Estimated Closing Statement provided by the Seller Parent to
the Buyer Parent shall be binding for purposes of this _Section_ __ _
2.4(b)_, but not, for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of _Section_ __ _
2.4(c)_.

 



35

    

(ii) In consideration for the sale and transfer of the First Closing
Transferred Assets by the Sellers to the Buyer Parent (through the Buyers),
the relevant Buyer shall assume responsibility for the First Closing Assumed
Liabilities as of the First Closing (as set forth on the Entity-to-Entity
Asset and Liability Transfer Plan), and the Buyer Parent shall cause the
Buyers to pay at the First Closing by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by the Seller Parent,
cash consideration equal to the Initial First Closing Purchase Price, which
shall be paid to the Sellers in accordance with the allocation of the Purchase
Price determined in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.13_ and in U.S. Dollars
or such currencies as are agreed by the Parties as part of that allocation
process. For the avoidance of doubt, any purchase price amount stated in any
local transfer agreement as may be entered into at the First Closing is
included in the Initial First Closing Purchase Price and is not payable in
addition thereto.

 

(c) _Determination of Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(i) Promptly after the First Closing Date, and in any event not later than
forty-five (45) days following the First Closing Date, the Buyer Parent shall
either (A) confirm its agreement with the Estimated Closing Statement, in
which case the Estimated Closing Statement shall be deemed final and binding,
and the Initial First Closing Purchase Price shall be deemed to be the Final
First Closing Purchase Price for all purposes hereunder or (B) prepare and
deliver to the Seller Parent a statement (the " _First Closing Statement_ ")
consisting of (1) a schedule setting forth, in reasonable detail, the
aggregate amount of CapEx made by the Seller Parent and its Affiliates during
the period from the date of this Agreement through (and including) the First
Closing Date, which amount shall be calculated in a manner consistent with
the calculation methodologies and principles used by the Seller Parent to
prepare the CapEx Schedule and (2) the Buyer Parents good faith calculations
(the " _Buyer Parent s Proposed Calculations_") of (y) the amount of the
CapEx Adjustment and (z) a calculation of the Final First Closing Purchase
Price. In the event that the Buyer Parent does not deliver to the Seller
Parent the confirmation set forth in the foregoing clause (A) or the First
Closing Statement set forth in the foregoing clause (B) within thirty (30)
days following the First Closing Date, the Estimated Closing Statement shall
be deemed final and binding and the Initial First Closing Purchase Price
shall be deemed to be the Final First Closing Purchase Price for all purposes
hereunder. Upon delivery of the First Closing Statement, the Buyer Parent
shall provide the Seller Parent and its Representatives with reasonable
access, during normal business hours, to the SSD Businesss accounting and
other personnel and to the books and records of the Business, as the case may
be, and any other document or information reasonably requested by the
Seller Parent, and necessary in order to allow the Seller Parent and its
Representatives to verify the accuracy of the First Closing Statement,
including the Buyer Parents Proposed Calculations.

 

(ii) The Seller Parent may object to any First Closing Statement delivered by
the Buyer Parent to the Seller Parent in compliance with _Section_ __ _
2.4(c)(i)_ by delivering to the Buyer Parent a written notice of objection (a
" _Notice of Objection_ ") within thirty (30) days after the Seller Parents
receipt of such First Closing Statement. In the event that the Seller Parent
does not deliver to the Buyer Parent any such Notice of Objection within
thirty (30) days after the Seller Parents receipt of the First Closing
Statement, the recalculation of the Initial First Closing Purchase Price
pursuant to the Buyer Parents Proposed Calculations shall be deemed final and
binding. A Notice of Objection under this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)(ii)_ shall
set forth in reasonable detail the Seller Parents alternative calculations
of (A) the relevant capital expenditure amount and the

 



36

    

 CapEx Adjustment calculated by reference thereto and (B) a recalculation of
the Final First Closing Purchase Price based on such amounts.

 

(iii) If the Seller Parent delivers a Notice of Objection to the Buyer Parent
within the thirty (30) day period referred to in _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)(ii)_,
then any element of the Buyer Parents Proposed Calculations that is not in
dispute on the date such Notice of Objection is given shall be treated as
final and binding and any disputed amounts (all such amounts, the " _Disputed
Amounts_ ") shall be resolved as set forth in this _Section_ __ _
2.4(c)(iii)_:

 

(A) The Seller Parent and the Buyer Parent shall promptly endeavor in good
faith to resolve the Disputed Amounts listed in the Notice of Objection. If a
written agreement determining the Disputed Amounts has not been reached within
ten (10) Business Days (or such longer period as may be agreed by the Seller
Parent and the Buyer Parent) after the date of receipt by the Buyer Parent
from the Seller Parent of the Notice of Objection, the resolution of such
Disputed Amounts shall be submitted to an impartial nationally recognized firm
of independent certified public accounts mutually agreed by the Buyer Parent
and the Seller Parent (the " _Arbitrator_ ").

(B) The Seller Parent and the Buyer Parent shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Arbitrator to render a decision in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)(iii)_ along with a statement of reasons
therefor within thirty (30) days of the submission of the Disputed Amounts to
the Arbitrator. The decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding upon
each Party and the decision of the Arbitrator shall constitute an arbitral
award that is final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a judgment may
be entered by a court having jurisdiction thereover.

 

(C) The Final First Closing Purchase Price shall be recalculated based upon
the final determination of the Arbitrator with respect to the Disputed
Amounts and the Final First Closing Purchase Price, as so recalculated, shall
be deemed to be final and binding. If the Seller Parent and the Buyer Parent
submit any Disputed Amounts to the Arbitrator for resolution, the Seller
Parent and the Buyer Parent shall each pay their own costs and expenses
incurred under this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)(iii)_ and half of the fees and
costs of the Arbitrator.

 

(D) The Arbitrator shall act as an arbitrator to determine, based upon the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)(iii)_, only the Disputed Amounts
and the determination of each amount of the Disputed Amounts shall be made in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)(iii)_.
The Arbitrator shall choose between the position of the Seller Parent or the
position of the Buyer Parent with respect to each Disputed Amount.

 

(iv) Upon the determination, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)(ii)_
or  _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)(iii)_ of the Final First Closing Purchase Price,
the Seller Parent or the Buyer Parent, as the case may be, shall make the
payment required by this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)(iv)_. The amount payable by
the Seller or the Buyer Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.4(c)(iv)_ is
referred to herein as the "Purchase Price Adjustment" and shall be treated as
an adjustment to the purchase price for federal, state, local and foreign
income Tax purposes.

 



37

    

(A) If the Final First Closing Purchase Price is greater than the Initial
First Closing Purchase Price, then (x) the Buyer Parent shall pay to the
Seller Parent for the account of the Sellers the difference between the Final
First Closing Purchase Price and the Initial First Closing Purchase
Price within five (5) Business Days of the determination of the Final First
Closing Purchase Price, such Purchase Price Adjustment to be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
by the Seller Parent in writing to the Buyer Parent promptly after the final
determination of the Final First Closing Purchase Price.

 

(B) If the Final First Closing Purchase Price is less than the Initial First
Closing Purchase Price, then the Seller Parent shall pay to the Buyer Parent
for the account of the Buyers the difference between the Initial First Closing
Purchase Price and the Final First Closing Purchase Price within five (5)
Business Days of the determination of the Final First Closing Purchase Price,
such Purchase Price Adjustment to be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Buyer Parent in writing to the
Seller Parent promptly after the determination of the Final First Closing
Purchase Price.

2.5 _First Closing_. The closing of the First Closing Transactions (the
" _First Closing_ ") shall be held (i) remotely via electronic mail exchange
of executed documents on the seventh (7 _th_ ) Business Day after all of the
conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VIII-A_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature can only be satisfied or waived at the First Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at that time) are satisfied
or waived (to the extent such waiver is permitted by applicable Law) or (ii)
in such other manner on such other date as may be mutually agreed upon in
writing by the Seller Parent and the Buyer Parent (the date on which
the First Closing takes place being the " _First Closing Date_ ") _provided_
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the First Closing shall not occur prior
to November 1, 2021 (the " _Inside Date_ "). The First Closing, and all First
Closing Transactions to occur at the First Closing, shall be deemed to have
taken place at, and shall be effective as of, 12:01 a.m. (Pacific) on the
First Closing Date.

 

2.6 _T_ _ransactions to be Effected in Connection with the First Closing_.
__

 

(a) At the First Closing each of the Seller Parent and the Buyer Parent shall
deliver or perform (or ensure that there is delivered or performed) the First
Closing Transaction Agreements and such duly executed bills of sale,
assignment and assumption agreements, local transfer agreements and other
instruments of transfer necessary for the transfer of the First
Closing Transferred Assets and the assumption of the First Closing Assumed
Liabilities (the " _First Closing Deliverables_ ") as shall be mutually agreed
upon by the Parties prior to the First Closing (the " _First
Closing Transactions_ ").

(b) On the First Closing Date the Seller Parent shall (i) execute, and cause
the applicable Sellers to execute the Restructuring Agreement and (ii)
restructure, or cause the restructure of, the NAND Business (in accordance
with the terms of the Restructuring Agreement). The date upon which such
restructuring of the NAND Business is effective, pursuant to the terms of the
Restructuring Agreement, is referred to herein as the " _Restructuring
Effective Date_ ".

 B. _The Second Closing_. 

 

2.7 _Sale, Purchase and Assumption at the Second Closing_. __ Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Second Closing the
Seller Parent shall, and shall cause the relevant Seller(s) to, sell to the
Buyer Parent (through the Buyer(s)), and the Buyer Parent shall, and shall
cause the other Buyer(s) to, purchase from the relevant Seller(s), all of
such Sellers right, title and interest in and to the OpCo Shares.

2.8 _Identity of Parties for Second Closing_. At least one hundred twenty
(120) days prior to the Second Closing Date, the parties shall mutually agree
to an updated Entity-to-Entity Asset and Liability Transfer Plan, which
updated plan shall detail which Sellers will transfer the OpCo Shares to which
Buyers; _provided_ that in no event shall Buyer Parent or its Affiliates be
required to purchase all OpCo Shares with one Buyer. The Buyer Parent shall
have the right to designate, by written notice to the Seller Parent not less
than thirty (30) days prior to the Second Closing Date, one (1) or more of its
Affiliates to purchase any or all of the OpCo Shares, by way of substitution
for, or in addition to, one (1) or more of the entities identified on the
updated Entity-to-Entity Asset and Liability Transfer Plan;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Buyer Parent shall not have the right set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.8_ if any such addition or substitution would, or would be
reasonably likely to, (a) prohibit, delay or impede the Second Closing or (b)
result in any material adverse tax consequence to the Seller Parent, any
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates. The Seller Parent shall have the
right to amend, by written notice to the Buyer Parent not less than sixty
(60) days prior to the Second Closing Date, the list of the Sellers identified
on the Entity-to-Entity Asset and Liability Transfer Plan;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Seller Parent shall not have the right set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 2.8_ if such amendment would, or would be reasonably likely
to, (a) prohibit, delay or impede the Second Closing or (b) result in any
material adverse tax consequence to the Buyer Parent, any Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates.

 

2.9 _Second Closing Consideration_. In consideration for the sale and transfer
of the OpCo Shares by the Seller(s) to the Buyer Parent (through the Buyers),
the Buyer Parent shall cause the Buyers to pay at the Second Closing by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
in writing by the Seller Parent, (a) cash consideration equal to
US$2,000,000,000 (the " _Second Closing Purchase Price_ ") _plus_ (b) the
Undistributed Deferred Revenue Amount. Seller Parent shall deliver a written
statement to the Buyer Parent no less than ninety (90) days prior to the
Second Closing Date (unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Buyer Parent and
the Seller Parent) providing Seller Parents reasonable estimate of the
Undistributed Deferred Revenue Amount, together with all information and
documentation reasonably needed to calculate the Undistributed Deferred
Revenue Amount. The Undistributed Deferred Revenue Amount shall be deemed
final unless Buyer Parent objects to Seller Parents estimate in writing
within thirty (30) days after receipt of Seller Parents written statement.
In the event of any such objection, Buyer Parent and Seller Parent shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if Buyer Parent and Seller Parent are unable to resolve any dispute with
respect to the Undistributed Deferred Revenue Amount within thirty (30) days
after Seller Parents receipt of such written objection, such dispute shall be
resolved by an impartial, internationally recognized firm of independent
certified public accountants mutually appointed by the Buyer Parent and the
Seller Parent. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be borne
equally by the Buyer Parent and the Seller Parent. The Second Closing
Purchase Price and the Undistributed Deferred Revenue Amount shall be paid to
the Sellers in U.S. Dollars or such currencies as are agreed by the Parties.
For the avoidance of doubt, any purchase price amount stated in any local
transfer agreement

 



39

    

 as may be entered into at the Second Closing is included in the Second
Closing Purchase Price and is not payable in addition thereto.

 

2.10 _Second Closing_. __ The closing of the Second Closing Transactions
(the "Second Closing") shall be held (i) remotely via electronic mail
exchange of executed documents on the seventh (7th) Business Day after all of
the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VIII-B_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature can only be satisfied or waived at the Second Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at that time) are
satisfied or waived (to the extent such waiver is permitted by applicable
Law) or (ii) in such other manner on such other date as may be mutually agreed
upon in writing by the Seller Parent and the Buyer Parent; _provided_ that in
no event shall the Second Closing occur prior to the Earliest Second Closing
Date (the date on which the Second Closing takes place being the " _Second
Closing Date_ "). The Second Closing, and all Second Closing Transactions to
occur at the Second Closing, shall be deemed to have taken place at, and
shall be effective as of, 12:01 a.m. (Pacific) on the Second Closing Date.

 

2.11 _Transactions to be Effected at the_ _Second_ _Closing_. At the
Second Closing each of the Seller Parent and the Buyer Parent shall deliver
or perform (or ensure that there is delivered or performed) the Second Closing
Transaction Agreements and such duly executed local transfer agreements and
other instruments of transfer necessary for the transfer of the Second
Closing Transferred Assets and the assumption of the Second Closing Assumed
Liabilities (the " _Second Closing Deliverables_ ") as shall be mutually
agreed upon by the Parties prior to the Second Closing (the " _Second Closing
Transactions_ ").

2.12 _Non-Assignable Assets._

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to sell, transfer,
assign, convey or deliver to any Buyer, any First Closing Transferred Asset,
or any claim, right, benefit or obligation arising thereunder or resulting
therefrom, or the assumption by any Buyer of any First Closing Assumed
Liability, if such attempted sale, transfer, assignment, conveyance, delivery
or assumption thereof, or an agreement to do any of the foregoing,
without the consent of a third party (including any Governmental Entity) (any
such consent, a " _Transfer Consent_ "), would constitute a breach or other
contravention thereof or a violation of Law or would in any way materially and
adversely affect the rights of the relevant Buyer (as assignee or transferee
of the applicable Seller, or otherwise) thereto or thereunder. If any such
Transfer Consent is required, the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ shall
apply.

 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, neither the failure to transfer any
Transferred Asset or First Closing Assumed Liability in the circumstances set
out in _Section_ __ _ 2.12(a)_ nor any claim, right, or benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom to the relevant Buyer, shall result in any
adjustment to the Purchase Price; _provided_ that this is without prejudice
to the rights of the Buyer Parent and its Affiliates under this Agreement
(including pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2_).

 

2.13 _Allocation of the Purchase Pric_ _e_.

 

(a) [Intentionally omitted.]

 

(b) Within eight (8) months after the date hereof (but in no event less
than ninety (90) days prior to when the First Closing Date is reasonably
expected to occur), the Seller Parent shall deliver to the Buyer Parent a
schedule (the " _First Closing Purchase Price Allocation_ ") allocating the
Initial 

 



40

    

 First Closing Purchase Price (using a reasonable estimate of the Estimated
CapEx Adjustment and including any First Closing Assumed Liabilities treated
as consideration for the First Closing Transferred Assets for income Tax
purposes) among the First Closing Transferred Assets and such other assets or
rights acquired, or to be acquired, by Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates
pursuant to the Transaction Agreements (other than Second Closing Transferred
Assets). The Parties acknowledge and agree that (i) a portion of the Initial
First Closing Purchase Price (as adjusted as set forth above), as determined
in accordance with and subject to the requirements of this  _Section_ __ _
2.13(b)_, shall be treated as amounts paid to OpCo for the provision of future
goods and services pursuant to the Manufacturing and Sale Agreement (such
portion, the " _Deferred Revenue Amount_ ") and (ii) such Deferred Revenue
Amount shall be amortized ratably over the Term (as defined in the
Manufacturing and Sale Agreement). The remainder of the Initial First Closing
Purchase Price (as adjusted as set forth above) shall be allocated
in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign
Law, as applicable). If the fair market value of the First Closing Transferred
Assets (and/or such other assets or rights) is greater than the Initial First
Closing Purchase Price (using a reasonable estimate of the Estimated CapEx
Adjustment and including any First Closing Assumed Liabilities treated as
consideration for the First Closing Transferred Assets for income Tax
purposes), then a portion of the Second Closing Purchase Price shall be
treated as consideration for the First Closing Transferred Assets (and/or such
other assets or rights) to the extent of such excess (other than any amounts
required to be treated as interest under applicable Law); _provided_ that (A)
the determination of the fair market value of the First Closing Transferred
Assets (and/or such other assets or rights) and thus any portion of
the Second Closing Purchase Price treated as consideration for the First
Closing Transferred Assets (and/or such other assets or rights) shall be
subject to the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 2.13(b)_, and (B) the
Parties agree and acknowledge that in the event the Second Closing does not
occur, any portion of the Second Closing Purchase Price allocated to the First
Closing Transferred Assets (and/or such other assets or rights) shall be
reduced to zero for purposes of the First Closing Purchase Price Allocation
and treated as a purchase price reduction with respect to the First Closing
Transferred Assets (and not as cancellation of indebtedness income recognized
by Buyer Parent or its Affiliates), to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, and the Parties shall not take any actions that would be reasonably
expected to affect the foregoing intended tax treatment, except as required by
applicable Law. The First Closing Purchase Price Allocation shall be deemed
final by the Buyer Parent unless the Buyer Parent notifies the Seller Parent
in writing that the Buyer Parent objects to one or more items reflected in the
First Closing Purchase Price Allocation within sixty (60) days after
delivery of the First Closing Purchase Price Allocation to the Buyer Parent.
In the event of any such objection, the Buyer Parent and the Seller Parent
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute; _provided_ , _however_
, that if the Buyer Parent and the Seller Parent are unable to resolve any
dispute with respect to the First Closing Purchase Price Allocation within
thirty (30) days after the delivery of such written objection, such dispute
shall be resolved by an impartial, internationally recognized firm of
independent certified public accountants mutually appointed by the Buyer
Parent and the Seller Parent. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm
shall be borne equally by the Buyer Parent and the Seller Parent. The Parties
shall revise and/or amend the First Closing Purchase Price Allocation with
respect to (i) any material change affecting the composition or relative
values of the First Closing Transferred Assets (or such other assets or
rights acquired, or to be acquired, by Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates
pursuant to the Transaction Agreements (other than Second Closing Transferred
Assets)) or the First Closing Assumed Liabilities between the date the First
Closing Purchase Price Allocation is finalized and the First Closing Date, as
agreed by the Parties (with any dispute resolved by an impartial,
internationally recognized firm of independent certified public accountants
mutually appointed by the Buyer Parent and the Seller Parent, whose fees and
expenses shall be borne equally by

 



41

    

 the Buyer Parent and the Seller Parent), and (ii) any adjustment, if
applicable, pursuant to _ARTICLE X_. The Parties shall not, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates not to, take any position or action inconsistent
with the First Closing Purchase Price Allocation, if any, except upon a final
determination by an applicable Tax Authority. The parties hereby agree that
(A) this _Section_ __ _ 2.13(b)_ applies solely to tax and accounting
treatment and reporting of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreements, and (B) nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.13(b)_ will affect the
amounts of the Initial First Closing Purchase Price, the Final First Closing
Purchase Price, or the Second Closing Purchase Price or when such amounts are
required to be paid.

 

(c) Based on the First Closing Purchase Price Allocation, the Parties shall
agree:

 

(i) on, or prior to, the date any Transfer Taxes and/or VAT are due in respect
of the First Closing Transactions, on a statement setting forth the allocable
portion of the Initial First Closing Purchase Price applicable to any First
Closing Transferred Assets subject to such Transfer Tax and/or VAT; and

 

(ii) at least thirty (30) days prior to the First Closing, in writing in a
form to be mutually agreed upon by the Parties, (A) the allocation of the
Initial First Closing Purchase Price to be paid to each Seller and (B) the
currency(ies) in which the Initial First Closing Purchase Price will be paid
to each Seller.

 

(d) The provisions of _Sections 2.13(b)_ and _2.13(c)_ shall apply to the
Second Closing Transactions _mutatis mutandis_ ; _provided_ that if any
portion of the Second Closing Purchase Price is allocated to the First Closing
Transferred Assets (or such other assets or rights acquired, or to be
acquired, by Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates pursuant to the
Transaction Agreements (other than Second Closing Transferred Assets)) under
_Section_ __ _ 2.13(b)_, such portion shall not be allocated to the Second
Closing Transferred Assets, and in no event shall any additional amount be
required to be paid for the Second Closing Transferred Assets

2.14  _Withholding_. Each Party is permitted to deduct or withhold
amounts from all amounts payable hereunder as required under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , at least twenty (20) days prior to the First Closing
Date and the Second Closing Date, as applicable, the Buyer Parent shall
deliver to the Seller Parent a schedule of expected withholding amounts with
respect to the First Closing Transactions and the Second Closing Transactions,
as applicable, with written explanations for each (which schedule may assume
that each Seller will provide any applicable forms or certificates listed on
such schedule and reasonably required to claim an available reduced rate of,
or exemption from, withholding Taxes). Furthermore, each Party shall
reasonably cooperate to reduce the amount of withholding Taxes imposed on
amounts payable hereunder, including by executing and filing any forms or
certificates reasonably required to claim an available reduced rate of, or
exemption from, withholding Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
or withheld pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.14_ and paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

2.15 _Technology Transfer Agreement_. Notwithstanding (but without
prejudice to) any technology transfer plan developed by the Parties pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 5.13_, in the event that any "intangible personal property"
(within the meaning of the California Revenue and Taxation Code section 

 



42

    

 6012(c)(10)) is transferred through the use of "tangible personal property"
(within the meaning of the California Revenue and Taxation Code section
6012(c)(10)), the Parties agree they intend for this Agreement to be a
"technology transfer agreement" as defined in California Revenue and Taxation
Code section 6012(c)(10) and California Sale and Use Tax Regulations 1507 and
that the fair market value for such tangible personal property shall be
provided on the relevant First Closing Purchase Price Allocation and that no
additional consideration under this Agreement is allocable to any such
tangible personal property, unless otherwise determined upon a
final determination by a Tax Authority.

2.16 _Local Transfer Agreements_.

 

(a) To the extent that the provisions of any local transfer agreement that is
a First Closing Deliverable or a Second Closing Deliverable, as applicable,
are inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement:

(i) the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail; and

(ii) so far as permissible under applicable Law, the Seller Parent and the
Buyer Parent shall cause the provisions of the relevant local transfer
agreement to be amended to give effect to the provisions of this Agreement.

 

(b) The Seller Parent shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to),
bring any claim against the Buyer Parent or the Buyer Parents Affiliates in
respect of or based upon any local transfer agreement as may be entered into
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement except to the extent necessary
to implement any transfer of the Transferred Assets as contemplated by this
Agreement, the assumption of Assumed Liabilities or other terms hereof in a
manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement. All such claims (except as
referred to above) shall be brought and be subject to the provisions, rights
and limitations as set out in this Agreement and no Person shall be entitled
to recover damages or obtain payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity
under or pursuant to any local transfer agreement as may be entered into in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement (but without prejudice to the
establishment of the existence of the claim hereunder).

 

(c) The Buyer Parent shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to)
bring any claim against the Seller Parent or the Seller Parents Affiliates
in respect of or based upon any local transfer agreement as may be entered
into in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, except to the extent
necessary to implement any transfer of the Transferred Assets as contemplated
by this Agreement, the assumption of Assumed Liabilities or other terms hereof
in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement. All such claims
(except as referred to above) shall be brought and be subject to the
provisions, rights and limitations as set out in this Agreement and no Person
shall be entitled to recover damages or obtain payment, reimbursement,
restitution or indemnity under or pursuant to any local transfer agreement as
may be entered into in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (but
without prejudice to the establishment of the existence of the claim
hereunder).

 

ARTICLE III

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER PARENT_

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered to the Buyer Parent
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (as it may be updated
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the " _Disclosure_

 



43

    

  _Schedule_ "), which is organized by reference to the specific Sections and
subsections of this Agreement to which the applicable disclosure relates (
_provided_ that disclosure in any Section or subsection of the Disclosure
Schedule shall apply to any other Section or subsection to the extent that the
relevance of such disclosure to such other Section or subsection is reasonably
apparent on its face and without the need to refer to any other information
or document), the Seller Parent represents and warrants to the Buyer Parent as
follows as of the date of this Agreement, as of the First Closing Date and,
solely with respect to the Second Closing Transferred Assets, the Second
Closing Assumed Liabilities, OpCo, the OpCo Shares and the NAND Business, as
of the Second Closing Date:

3.1  _Organization and Qualification_. Each of the Sellers is a
corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity, duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing (to the extent such concept is
legally recognized) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization,
except, with respect to good standing, where the failure to be in good
standing has not or would not reasonably be expected to (a) prevent, hinder,
impede or materially delay any of the Transactions, as applicable, or (b)
materially impair the ability of a Seller to perform its obligations under
this Agreement or any Transaction Agreements to which it is a party. Each of
the Sellers has all requisite corporate or other organizational power and
authority to carry on its businesses (including the Business) as being
conducted as of the date of this Agreement and is qualified to do business and
is in good standing (to the extent such concept or a comparable status is
recognized) as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the conduct of
its business requires such qualification, except, with respect to good
standing, where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing has not or
would not reasonably be expected to (a) prevent, hinder, impede or materially
delay any of the First Closing Transactions or the Second Closing
Transactions, as applicable, or (b) materially impair the ability of a Seller
to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any Transaction Agreements
to which it is a party.

3.2 _Authority Relative to the Transaction Agreement_ _s_. Each of the
Sellers has all necessary corporate or other organizational, as applicable,
powers and authorities to execute and deliver the Transaction Agreements to
which it is a party and to fully perform its respective obligations hereunder
or thereunder (as applicable) and to consummate the Transactions, as
applicable. Other than any vote or approval from a wholly-owned Affiliate of
any Seller that will be obtained prior to Closing, no vote or approval is
required by any shareholder or other equityholder of any Seller in connection
with execution or consummation of the Transaction Agreements or any of the
Transactions, as applicable, whether under its respective
Organizational Documents or under applicable Law, a shareholder or voting
agreement or otherwise.

 

3.3 _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_.

 

(a) No Permit of, with or from, any Governmental Entity is required on the
part of (i) any Seller for the execution and delivery by such Seller of the
Transaction Agreements to which it is a party and the performance of its
obligations hereunder or thereunder (as applicable) and (ii) any Seller for
the consummation of the Transactions, as applicable, except, in each case of
the foregoing sub-clauses (i) and (ii), (A) as listed in _Section_ __ _
3.3(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule; and (B) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law or in connection with
seeking CFIUS Approval or any other Requisite Governmental Approval. Assuming
compliance with the items described in sub-clauses (A) and (B) of the
preceding sentence and receipt of the Transfer Consents, neither the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or any Transaction
Agreement by any Seller, nor the consummation by any Seller of the
Transactions, as applicable, will (1) conflict with or

 



44

    

 result in any breach or violation of any provision of its respective
Organizational Documents; (2) result in a breach, violation or infringement
of, or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default
(or give rise to the creation of any Lien, except for Permitted Liens, or any
right of or to notice, consent, termination, amendment, cancellation or
acceleration) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
Transferred Contract or (3) violate any Law applicable to any Seller.

(b)   _Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule will include, as
of the date of this Agreement, a true, complete and correct list of all
Transfer Consents.

 

3.4 _Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Copies of the unaudited combined financial statements of the Business
and Fab Assets consisting of (1) the balance sheet as at June 27, 2020 and
the related statement of income for the six months period ending June 27,
2020; and (2) the balance sheet as at December 28, 2019 and the related
statement of income for the year ending December 28, 2019, in each case
excluding any income tax provision balances and/or activity (collectively, the
" _Combined Modified Financial Statements_ ") have been Made Available to the
Buyer Parent. The Combined Modified Financial Statements (A) have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP (applied on a consistent basis with its
application in connection with the audited consolidated balance sheet of the

Date until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Second Closing Date, the Seller
Parent shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and, subject to
reasonable confidentiality undertakings being provided by the Buyer Parent,
afford to, or cause to be afforded to, Representatives of the Buyer Parent
reasonable access during normal business hours to the relevant portions of
books and records of the Business that are not included in the Transferred
Assets that relate to the period before the First Closing with respect to the
First Closing Transferred Assets or the First Closing Assumed Liabilities or
the period before the Second Closing with respect to the Second Closing
Transferred Assets or the Second Closing Assumed Liabilities, in each case to
the extent reasonably required by the Buyer Parent or another Buyer and upon
reasonable advance notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in  _ARTICLE VII_ , the Seller Parent shall not be
required to provide access to any income Tax Return or any consolidated,
combined, unitary, group or similar Tax Return, in each case of the Seller
Parent or any of its Affiliates, or any other Tax Return or Tax record of the
Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates, except if it relates solely to OpCo,
the Business or the Transferred Assets, and (ii) the Buyers agree that any
permitted investigation undertaken by the Buyer Parent pursuant to the access
granted under this _Section_ __ _ 5.1(c)_ shall be conducted in such a manner
as not to unreasonably interfere with the Seller Parents and its Affiliates
business operations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) neither the Seller
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or
disclose information pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.1(c)_ where, upon the
advice of counsel, such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of the Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, contravene
any applicable Laws, violate any confidentiality obligations of the Seller
Parent, any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (including with
respect to MTI Confidential Information), or disclose any Competitively
Sensitive Information and (B) auditors and accountants of the Seller Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to make any work papers
available to any Person unless and until such Person has signed a customary
agreement relating to such access in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to such auditors or accountants.

 

(d) The Buyer Parent agrees to hold, or to cause its relevant Affiliates
to hold (as the case may be), (i) all the SSD Transferred Books and Records
in each case existing on the First Closing Date and not to destroy or dispose
of any thereof for a period of six (6) years from the First Closing Date or
such longer time as may be required by applicable Law and (ii) all the NAND
Transferred Books and Records in each case existing on the Second Closing Date
and not to destroy or dispose of any thereof for

 



64

    

 a period of six (6) years from the Second Closing Date or such longer time
as may be required by applicable Law; _provided_ that if the Buyer Parent
desires to destroy or dispose of such books and records prior to such
applicable date, it will offer in writing, at least sixty (60) days prior to
such destruction or disposition, to surrender them to the Seller Parent. The
Seller Parent agrees to hold all books and records (A) to the extent relating
to the First Closing Transferred Assets or the First Closing Assumed
Liabilities existing on the First Closing Date (but not transferred to any
Buyer) and not to destroy or dispose of any thereof for a period of six (6)
years from the First Closing Date or such longer time as may be required by
applicable Law and (B) to the extent relating to the Second Closing
Transferred Assets or the Second Closing Assumed Liabilities existing on the
Second Closing Date (but not transferred to any Buyer) and not to destroy or
dispose of any thereof for a period of six (6) years from the Second Closing
Date or such longer time as may be required by applicable Law; _provided_ that
if the Seller Parent desires to destroy or dispose of such books and records
prior to such applicable date, it will offer in writing, at least sixty (60)
days prior to such destruction or disposition, to surrender them to the Buyer
Parent.

 

(e) (i) In furtherance of the Parties intent to transfer all of the
Transferred Assets to the Buyer Parent (or the relevant Buyer) at the
applicable Closing, the Buyer Parent or any of its Representatives shall have
the right, subject to the Sellers compliance with their respective
obligations relating to MTI Confidential Information and Competitively
Sensitive Information (and in compliance with all COVID-19 Restrictions), to
meet with representatives of the Seller Parent to conduct an inspection of any
of the sites at which the SSD Business is operated (including sites at which
Transferred Assets are located) to confirm and identify those assets that
constitute, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_, Transferred Assets. Any
inspection at any such site (A) shall take place (x) over a period not to
exceed one-hundred and eighty (180) days after the date of this Agreement, (y)
upon five (5) days prior written notice delivered by Buyer Parent to Seller
Parent, and (z) during the normal business hours of such site and (B) shall
not unreasonably interfere with or disrupt the business or operations at such
site.

 

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing clause (i), with respect
to any site visit to the Dalian Fab prior to the First Closing, the Buyer
Parent shall designate representatives of any Buyer, upon not fewer than five
(5) days prior written notice, during the Dalian Fabs normal business hours,
and at the Buyer Parents sole expense, to visit and inspect the Fab Assets,
which visits shall not occur more than once in any three (3) month period. All
site visits shall be conducted in a manner reasonably designed not to
unreasonably interfere with or disrupt the Dalian Fabs business or
operations; provided, that, if a site visit does unreasonably interfere with
or disrupt the Dalian Fabs business or operations, the site visit shall be
paused while Seller Parent and Buyer Parent reasonably agree on changes to
the site visit procedures that will end such unreasonable interference or
disruption. During any such site visit, all such Buyer representatives shall
(1) be accompanied by one or more representatives of the Seller Parent or a
Seller at all times during such visits, (2) abide by the instructions of such
accompanying representatives of the Seller Parent or a Seller while in the
Dalian Fab if such instructions are reasonably required and indicated to be
for the purposes of protecting against disclosure of any OpCo Restricted
Information (as defined in the Manufacturing and Sale Agreement) and (3) not
be permitted to speak with any manufacturing engineers or otherwise be
provided access to any OpCo Restricted Information. For clarity, such Buyer
representatives shall be permitted to inspect the inventory of Wafers and
scrap Wafers. Except during a site visit as described in this _Section_ __ _
5.1(e)(ii)_, none of the Seller Parent, any other Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives may access the Dalian Fab prior to
the First Closing.

 



65

    

(iii) Any assets so identified as Transferred Assets during the inspections
that the Buyer Parent desires to acquire shall be added to _Schedule
2.2(a)(i)_ (if such added asset is related to the Fab Assets) or to _Schedule
2.2(a)(ii)_ (if such added asset is related to the SSD Business),
which shall, for all purposes under this Agreement, supplement and replace
the applicable schedule delivered to the Buyer Parent on the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ that any costs and expenses associated with transferring
any such additional assets to the Buyer Parent shall be paid by the Seller
Parent.

(f) The Seller Parent shall have the right to download, with respect to
each Closing as of or after the applicable date and time set forth in the
definition of "Made Available", and maintain for its own records a copy of the
Dataroom; _provided_ that if the Seller Parent does download a copy of the
Dataroom, it will prepare and provide the Buyer Parent with the same download.

(g)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each
Party agrees that, prior to the Second Closing Date, none of the Seller
Parent, any other Seller or any of their respective Affiliates will disclose
any, and is entitled to keep strictly confidential all, MTI Confidential
Information.

5.2  _Confidentiality_.

(a) The Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect, in accordance with its terms, except that the term set forth in
Section 3 of the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be modified such
that the confidentiality obligations of the Buyer Parent and its
Affiliates under the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue until (i) with
respect to Confidential Information (as defined therein) relating to the First
Closing Transferred Assets and the First Closing Assumed Liabilities, the
First Closing Date and (ii) with respect to Confidential Information (as
defined therein) relating to the Second Closing Transferred Assets and the
Second Closing Assumed Liabilities, the Second Closing Date.

 

(b) The Buyer Parent agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that,
from and after the Closing until the date that is three (3) years from the
earlier of the Second Closing Date and any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_ , except as otherwise consented to by the Seller
Parent and subject to the terms of any written, binding and enforceable
license or similar right or encumbrance granted to the Seller Parent and the
Buyer Parent and applicable restrictions set forth in the IP License
Agreement, all non-public information relating to the Seller Parent and its
Affiliates, the First Closing Excluded Assets, the Second Closing Excluded
Assets and the Retained Liabilities and all Transaction Information in the
possession of the Buyer Parent or any of its Representatives, including (i)
discussions relating to any such information (whether those discussions occur
before, concurrent with, or following disclosure thereof), (ii) information
Made Available, (iii) information disclosed in, or in connection with, any
management presentations or similar presentations disclosed by the Seller
Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with the Transactions, and (iv)
any data derived, summarized or extracted from any such
information, including, all portions of reports, analyses, compilations,
studies, interpretations, records, notes, copies or other materials prepared
by the Buyer Parent, its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
or otherwise on their behalf that contain, are based on, or otherwise reflect
or are generated in whole or in part from such information (collectively, "
_Seller Confidential Information_ ") will be kept confidential and will not be
disclosed by the Buyer Parent or any of its Representatives in any manner, in
whole or in part; _provided_ that, if the Buyer Parent, its Affiliates or any

 



66

    

 of their respective Representatives is required by applicable Law or by any
Governmental Entity to disclose any Seller Confidential Information, such
Person shall be permitted to do so without violating this _Section_ __ _
5.2(b)_, but the Buyer Parent shall or shall cause such Representative (in
each case, unless prohibited by applicable Law) to provide the Seller Parent
with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Seller Parent may
seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy. A breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_ by a Representative of the Buyer Parent shall be
deemed a breach by the Buyer Parent.

 

(c) The Seller Parent agrees, on behalf of itself and its Representatives
that, from and after the First Closing until the date that is three (3) years
from the earlier of the Second Closing Date and any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _ARTICLE IX_ , except as otherwise consented to by the
Buyer Parent and subject to the terms of any written, binding and enforceable
license or similar right or encumbrance granted to the Seller Parent and the
Buyer Parent and applicable restrictions set forth in the IP License
Agreement, all non-public information relating to the Buyer Parent and its
Affiliates, the Transferred Assets and the Assumed Liabilities and all
Transaction Information in the possession of the Seller Parent or any of
its Representatives, including (i) discussions relating to such information
(whether those discussions occur before, concurrent with, or following
disclosure of such information), (ii) information disclosed in, or in
connection with, any management presentations or similar presentations
disclosed by the Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with the
Transactions and (iii) any data derived, summarized or extracted from any such
information, including, all portions of reports, analyses, compilations,
studies, interpretations, records, notes, copies or other materials prepared
by the Seller Parent or its Representatives or otherwise on its behalf that
contain, are based on, or otherwise reflect or are generated in whole or in
part from such information (collectively " _Business Confidential Information_
") will be kept confidential and will not be disclosed by the Seller Parent or
any of its Representatives in any manner, in whole or in part;  _provided_
that, if the Seller Parent or any of its Representatives is required by
applicable Law to disclose any Business Confidential Information, such Person
shall be permitted to do so without violating this  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(c)_,
but the Seller Parent shall or shall cause such Representative to (in each
case, unless prohibited by applicable Law) provide the Buyer Parent with
prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Buyer Parent may seek
an appropriate protective order or other remedy. A breach of this _Section_ __
_ 5.2(c) _by a Representative of the Seller Parent shall be deemed a breach
by the Seller Parent.

 

(d) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_, neither "Seller
Confidential Information" nor "Business Confidential Information" shall
include any information: (i) that is or becomes generally available to the
public other than as a result of a disclosure by any Person not otherwise
permitted pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) of which such Person (or its
Representatives) learns from sources other than the Seller Parent or the Buyer
Parent (as applicable); _provided_ that, such source is not known by such
Person to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual,

Buyer Parent (as applicable) with respect to such information; (iii) known to
the receiving Person (or its Representatives) without any limitation on
disclosure before its receipt from the disclosing Person; (iv) independently

assigning existing relationships, Contracts, or obligations relating to any

5.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c) _shall require (I) the Buyer Parent to
offer, propose, negotiate, commit to, take or effect any remedial action (w)
that would have, or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or

 



68

    

 in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the assets, properties or

Transactions in connection with CFIUS Approval pursuant to the DPA, each with
regard to this Agreement, and if CFIUS suggests or requests that, or the Buyer
Parent or the Seller

 



69

    

 Parent determines it to be appropriate that, the Parties withdraw and

shall cooperate in withdrawing and resubmitting the CFIUS filing. Each of the
Buyer Parent and the Seller Parent shall respond to any request for
information from CFIUS in the timeframe set forth in 31 C.F.R. Part 800 (the "

mutually acceptable mitigation agreement, there is a Deemed CFIUS Order,
either Party may request, in connection with such Partys delivery of written
notice of termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)(ii)(B)(3)_, a
withdrawal of the notice filed with CFIUS in connection with CFIUS Approval
and no Party shall have any further obligation to seek CFIUS Approval.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, the
covenants and agreements set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_ constitute
the sole obligations of the Parties with respect to the efforts required to
obtain CFIUS Approval.

Governmental Entity, including all documentation that needs to be prepared
and filed as required to obtain the Dalian Land Use Approval, and entering
into any local transfer agreement that is a First Closing Deliverable; and (y)
with respect to the Second Closing Transactions, for preparing and filing
as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices,
reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all filings

transfer agreement that is a Second Closing Deliverable, in each case in order
to consummate the applicable Transactions and as necessary for the continued
lawful operation of the Business after the First Closing and Second Closing,
as applicable; _provided_ that the Seller Parent shall, and shall cause the
Sellers and its other controlled Affiliates (including OpCo) to, use
reasonable best efforts and give reasonable assistance to the Buyer Parent in
such efforts, including to communicate with any such Governmental Entity
(including with the applicable Local Governmental Entity in connection with
the Dalian Land Use Approval or with any incentive agreement relating to the
Dalian Fab and any other licenses or approvals required by a Governmental
Entity for the operation of the Business) on behalf of the Buyer Parent;
_provided_ that the foregoing agreement by the Seller Parent to provide
such assistance to the Buyer Parent shall not relieve the Buyer Parent of its
obligation to procure the Permits (including the Dalian Land Use Approval) and
make the filings referenced in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_. Subject

Governmental Entity relating to any such consent, approval or action; 

(C) provide the other Party (or its advisers) with a final draft of all
submissions, notifications, filings and other communications to any

Party to take into account any comments of the other Party (or its advisers)
on such drafts prior to their submission, including, for the avoidance of
doubt, information relating to the other Party or any of its controlled
Affiliates, as the case may be, that is required in any filings made with, or
written materials submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with the
Transactions;

(D) regularly review with the other Party or its advisers the progress of any
communications, notifications or filings with a view to obtaining the relevant

of their respective controlled Affiliates to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions, it being the intent that the Parties will
consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views
of one another, in connection with any such statement, filing, notice,
application or proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with the
performance of each Partys respective obligations, the Seller Parent and the
Buyer Parent may, as each determines is reasonably necessary, designate
competitively sensitive material provided to the other pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_ as "Outside Counsel Only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel
of the recipient Party and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
directors, officers or employees of the recipient Party unless written
consent is obtained in advance from the Party providing the materials or its
legal counsel.

 

(iii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing covenants and
agreements in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(c)_, the Parties shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof, agree upon the forms of (A) each
of the IP Agreements with respect to the items described in the IP Term Sheet,

Seller Parent or such Seller, as applicable, shall use its reasonable best
efforts to include therein an ability to assign to a Buyer the agreement or
the rights and obligations set forth in such agreement relating to such
incentive benefits; _provided_ that nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _
5.3(c)(iv)_ shall obligate the Seller Parent or any Seller to negotiate any
such incentive agreement.

confidentiality protections (including those set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.2_) and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, (i) each of the Parties
shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to consents,
clearances, approvals or authorizations of any Governmental Entity of the
Transactions, including those contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, which
appraisal shall include promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices
or other communications received by the Seller Parent or the Buyer Parent, as
the case may be, or any of their respective controlled Affiliates, from any
Governmental Entity with respect to such consents, clearances, approvals or
authorizations and (ii) neither the Seller Parent nor the Buyer Parent shall
permit any of their respective controlled Affiliates, officers or any other
Representatives to participate in any substantive meeting or substantive call
with any Governmental Entity in respect of any consents, clearances,
approvals, authorizations, filings, investigation or other inquiry with
respect to the Transactions unless such Party consults with the other Party
reasonably in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate.

Contracts_ "). The nature of the goods, services or intellectual property
rights provided under the Shared Contracts as of the date of this Agreement
is set forth on _Schedule 5.14_. During the period prior to the First Closing,
the Parties shall cooperate and shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts (including, with respect to the Buyer Parent, efforts
to amend and/or supplement any existing Contracts the Buyer Parent or any of
its Affiliates has with the counterparties to the Shared Contracts in order to
receive or provide all or some portion of the Shared Contract Rights under
such existing Contracts, which Contract, as so amended or supplemented, would
be a Replacement Contract) to obtain the agreement of the counterparties to
each such Shared Contract to enter into a new Contract (or Contract amendment,
as applicable), effective as of the relevant Closing Date (each, a "
_Replacement Contract_ "), pursuant to which the Buyer Parent or another
Buyer, as applicable, will receive or provide the goods, services and
intellectual property rights provided to or by the Seller Parent and its
Affiliates as of the date hereof pursuant to the Shared Contract (the "
_Shared Contract Rights_ ") on price and terms and conditions on and following
the relevant Closing substantially similar to those contained in the Shared
Contract as of the date hereof. If, as of the First Closing, the Seller Parent
or one of its Affiliates is required, pursuant to a Shared Contract, to
purchase goods or services used in or by the SSD Business, then the Buyer
Parent or another Buyer, as applicable, shall purchase such goods or services
from the Seller Parent or its Affiliate, as applicable, for the cost being
charged therefor under the applicable Shared Contract, as reflected on
_Schedule 5.14_ , or the Buyer Parent may decline to purchase such goods or
services if it reasonably determines after the First Closing that the SSD
Business does not require such goods or services, or it can procure such goods
or services at more favorable pricing than is charged under the applicable
Shared Contract. If one or more Replacement Contracts are not so obtained
prior to the relevant Closing, unless the Parties otherwise agree in writing
or unless doing so would not be permitted by applicable Law, the terms of the
applicable Shared Contract or the applicable counterparty, for a reasonable
period of time following the relevant Closing, the Parties will cooperate with
each other in any reasonable arrangements designed to provide to the Buyer
Parent or the relevant Buyer the Shared Contract Rights of the applicable
Shared Contract (and the Seller Parent or its applicable Affiliate shall
continue to perform such Shared Contract upon the direction of the Buyer
Parent); _provided_ that the Buyer Parent or the relevant Buyer shall bear
any incremental economic burden resulting from implementation of any such
alternative arrangement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ (other than any
Liability arising from a Shared Contract counterparty asserting that the
operation of this _Section_ __ _ 5.14_ is a breach of such Shared Contract,
in which case such Liability shall solely be for the account of the Seller
Parent or its applicable 

 



85

    

 Affiliate), and if the Buyer Parent or the relevant Buyer fails to timely
and fully bear such Liabilities with respect to any Shared Contract, the
Seller Parent shall no longer be obligated to provide Shared Contract Rights
for any Shared Contract hereunder. The Parties agree to treat any Shared
Contract Rights borne by the Buyer Parent or a Buyer as a Liability of such
Person for Tax purposes unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Further,
any reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses arising out of or related to
seeking or obtaining any Replacement Contracts shall be borne by the Buyer
Parent. 

5.15 _Affiliate Transactions_. On or before the First Closing Date,
except (a) pursuant to any Transaction Agreements and (b) in connection with

Business or the First Closing Transferred Assets shall be terminated in full,
without any liability to any Buyer following the First Closing, and the Seller
Parent shall deliver written evidence, in form and substance satisfactory to
the Buyer Parent, of such termination; _provided_ that if any such
transactions remain in effect after the First Closing, the Buyer Parent and
the Seller Parent shall (or shall cause their respective Affiliates to)
terminate such transactions without any liability to the Buyer Parent or its
Affiliates.

 

5.16 _Warranty Claims_. The Buyer Parent shall, or shall cause the

other loss of any Transferred Assets, the Seller Parent shall, and shall cause
the relevant Seller to, apply any insurance proceeds received by any Seller
after the date hereof in respect of such casualty, condemnation or other loss
to the prompt repair, replacement and restoration thereof in substantially the
same condition of such Transferred Assets as they existed before such event,

(and, if required by applicable Law to effectuate the transfer of any SSD
Business Employee, accompanied by an employment contract), to be effective on
the First Closing Date, to all Offer Employees who are not Key Employees
(including such Offer Employees who are absent due to vacation, family leave,
short-term disability, long-term disability or other approved leave of
absence), and allow each such Offer Employee two (2) weeks (or such longer
time period as may be required by applicable Law or any
Employee Representative Body (if applicable)) to consider and accept such
offer to be contingent on (i) the First Closing; (ii) such Offer Employee
having obtained the regulatory licenses (if any) and work permits as may be
required under applicable Law; (iii) Offer Employee being continuously
employed by the Seller Parent or an Employing Subsidiary through the First
Closing (or such later date contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_
above); (iv) subject to  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(i)_, such Offer Employee
agreeing to the termination of such Offer Employees employment contract with
the Seller Parent or Employing Subsidiary (including agreeing that any
applicable notice period shall be waived, such that employment with the
Seller Parent or Employing Subsidiary shall terminate on and be subject to
First Closing), if applicable, and (v) commencing active employment with the
Buyer Parent or one of the other Buyers (which employment, in respect of any
Offer Employees working in the Peoples Republic of China, shall be in the
same city as the Employing Subsidiary that employs the Offer Employees
immediately prior to the First Closing) on the First Closing Date (or such
later date contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(a)_); _provided_ that,
subject to any more favorable requirements under applicable Law, the Buyer
Parents and/or one of the other Buyers offer of employment (and, if
applicable, related employment contract) to any Offer Employee who is on
short-term or long-term disability leave at the time the First Closing occurs
(each such Offer Employee an " _Inactive SSD Employee_ ") shall also be
contingent on such Inactive SSD Employees return to active status within six
(6) months following the First Closing (or such later date as required by
applicable Law), and such Inactive SSD Employee shall remain employed by
the Seller Parent or an applicable Employing Subsidiary immediately following
the First Closing unless, and at such time as, such Inactive SSD Employee
returns to active status within six (6) months of the First Closing (or such
later date as required by applicable Law). Buyer Parent or one of the other
Buyers, as applicable, shall make reasonable best efforts to offer employment
in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ to all Key Employees as soon
as practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than
twenty-one (21) days after the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that, upon the written request of the Buyer Parent, the Seller Parent shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to make a potential Key Employee available
to meet with the Buyer Parent prior to the Buyer Parent or one of the other
Buyers making an offer of employment to such Key Employee. During the period
from the date of this Agreement to the First Closing Date, the Seller Parent
shall, and shall cause the Employing Subsidiaries to, and the Buyer Parent
shall, and shall cause the Buyers to, reasonably cooperate with each other to
assist the Buyer Parent and the other Buyers in their efforts to extend and
secure acceptances of offers of employment from the

 



92

    

 Offer Employees, including by making each Offer Employee accessible to the
Buyer Parent or the other Buyers.

 

(c) _Automatic Transfer Employees_. The Parties agree that where the
transfer of the Business will constitute the transfer of an undertaking or
business (or part thereof) for the purposes of the ARD, the contracts of
employment of the Automatic Transfer Employees and the rights, powers, duties,
liabilities and obligations of the Seller Parent or the Employing
Subsidiaries, as applicable, in respect of such contracts of employment, will
automatically transfer to the Buyer Parent or a Buyer at the First Closing in
accordance with the ARD. With respect to each Automatic Transfer Employee,
the Seller Parent and the Buyer Parent accept and agree to apply and comply
with the ARD and all of its applicable provisions, and accept and agree that
the terms and conditions of employment of each such Automatic Transfer
Employee will transfer effective as of the First Closing on such terms as may
be prescribed under the ARD and as if such terms and conditions were
originally made or agreed between the Buyer Parent and the applicable
Automatic Transfer Employee. The Seller Parent and the Buyer Parent shall
inform and consult in good faith with any appropriate Employee Representative
Bodies or the Automatic Transfer Employees or other employees to the extent
required by applicable Law. If the contract of employment of any SSD Business
Employee based in a jurisdiction where the ARD might apply does not transfer
to the Buyer Parent or one of the other Buyers in accordance with the ARD as
intended, such SSD Business Employee shall then be an Offer Employee and the
Buyer Parent or one of the other Buyers shall offer such SSD Business
Employee employment in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_; _provided_
that such offer shall be on the terms and conditions that would have applied
had the SSD Business Employee transferred to the Buyer Parent or one of the
other Buyers pursuant to the ARD.

 

(d) _Transferred SSD Employees_. Each SSD Business Employee, excluding any
Objecting Employee, whose employment transfers to or commences with the Buyer
Parent or one of the other Buyers on the First Closing Date (or, with respect
to Inactive SSD Employees, such later date contemplated by _Section_ __ _
6.1(b)_ pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.1_), shall be referred to herein
as a "Transferred SSD Employee." Effective as of the First Closing, and for a
period of twelve (12) months thereafter, the relevant employing Buyer shall
provide to each Transferred SSD Employee, for so long as such Transferred SSD
Employee remains employed during such period total direct compensation and
benefits equal to or greater than the amount of such total direct compensation
and benefits that each such Transferred SSD Employees is entitled to receive
immediately prior to the First Closing (not including any retention bonus
awarded to any such Transferred SSD Employee by Seller Parent or any of its
Affiliates). Subject to applicable Law, effective as of the First Closing and
for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, the relevant employing Buyer
shall provide to each Transferred SSD Employee, for so long as such
Transferred SSD Employee remains employed during such period, (i) at least
the same wage rate or base salary as in effect for such Transferred SSD
Employee as of immediately prior to the First Closing, (ii) target annual cash
bonus opportunities and quarterly profit-sharing bonus opportunities that are
no less favorable than as in effect for the applicable Transferred SSD
Employee immediately prior to the First Closing, and (iii) employee health,
welfare and retirement benefits (other than defined benefit pension or post-
employment welfare plans) that are substantially comparable in the aggregate
to either (x) those in effect for the applicable Transferred SSD Employee
immediately prior to the First Closing or (y) at the discretion of the Buyer
Parent, those provided to similarly situated employees of the Buyer Parent
employed in the same jurisdiction as such Transferred SSD Employee following
the First Closing. As of the First Closing or, with respect to Inactive SSD
Employees, such later date contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_, the
Seller Parent and its Affiliates shall ensure that each Transferred SSD
Employee is released from any post-termination or employment restrictions but
only to the extent that such restrictions would 

 



93

    

 prohibit or restrict such employee from performing his or her duties for the
Buyer Parent or any of the other Buyers solely with respect to the SSD
Business. For the avoidance of doubt, any post-termination restrictions
prohibiting or restricting such employees from soliciting, hiring and/or
otherwise interfering with any employees, officers, agents or representatives
of the Seller Parent and its Affiliates shall remain in full force and
effect.

(e) _SSD Business Employee List Updates_. Each month after the date of
this Agreement, the Seller Parent shall update the SSD Business Employee List
to reflect changes permitted by this Agreement, with a final updated version
of the SSD Business Employee List, including the name of each SSD Business
Employee (subject to applicable Law), to be provided no later than eight (8)
weeks prior to the First Closing (the " _Final SSD Business Employee List_ ");
provided that, to the extent any SSD Business Employee is added to the SSD
Business Employee List in connection with any such update, by no later than
four (4) weeks following such update, the Buyer Parent or one of the other
Buyers shall offer employment in writing (and, if required by applicable Law
to effectuate the transfer of any SSD Business Employee, accompanied by an
employment contract), to be effective on the First Closing Date, to all such
SSD Business Employees in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_ and allow
each such SSD Business Employee two (2) weeks (or such longer time period as
may be required by applicable Law or any Employee Representative Body (if
applicable)) to consider and accept such offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Final SSD Business Employee List may be updated thereafter and prior to
the First Closing to remove any SSD Business Employees who are no longer
employed by the Seller Parent or an Employing Subsidiary following the date of
the Final SSD Business Employee List due to death or disability, as a result
of a resignation, or as a result of a termination by the Seller Parent or the
applicable Employing Subsidiary for cause, and the Seller Parent shall notify
the Buyer Parent of any such updates within three (3) Business Days of
such updates and in no event later than the day immediately preceding the
First Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
such updates shall not be considered or treated as a supplement to or
amendment of the Disclosure Schedule for purposes of _Section_ __ _ 5.8_.

(f) _WARN Act_. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the First
Closing Date, the Seller Parent shall Make Available a list of the number of
employees of the Seller Parent or an Employing Subsidiary located at any
facility where a SSD Business Employee is based who, within ninety (90) days
prior to and including the First Closing, have experienced, or will
experience, an employment loss or layoff as defined by the Worker Adjustment
and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 __ or any similar applicable state
law (the "WARN Act"). For a period of thirty (30) days after the First Closing
Date, the Buyer Parent shall not, and shall ensure that no Buyer shall, engage
in any conduct which would result in an employment loss or layoff for a
sufficient number of SSD Business Employees which, when aggregated with
conduct on the part of the Seller Parent or its Affiliates prior to the First
Closing, would constitute a "plant closing," "mass layoff" or similar event
under the WARN Act. The Buyer Parent shall assume and be solely responsible
for and agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and, at the option of the Seller
Parent, to defend the Seller Parent or any of its respective Affiliates from
and against any Liability under the WARN Act and any statutory notice or
severance liability under applicable Law as a result of the Buyer Parents or
any relevant Buyers actions or omissions, including failure to serve
sufficient notice pursuant to the WARN Act.

(g) _Paid Time Off_. To the extent required by applicable Law, the Seller
Parent shall, or shall cause the applicable Employing Subsidiary to pay to
each Offer Employee who becomes a Transferred SSD Employee the value of such
Transferred SSD Employees accrued but unused paid time off by the date
required by applicable Law.



 



94

    

(h) _Foreign Nationals_. The Buyer Parent or the relevant Buyer shall use
reasonable best efforts to employ the SSD Business Employees who are foreign
nationals working in the United States or who are working outside of the
jurisdiction of his or her citizenship under terms and conditions such that
the Buyer Parent or the relevant Buyer will be considered, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the successor-in-interest to the applicable
Business for the applicable countrys immigration purposes. The Parties shall
cooperate to ensure the proper transfer of the sponsorship of work permits and
immigration visas, as applicable. The Buyer Parent or the relevant Buyer agree
to assume all immigration-related liabilities and responsibilities under
applicable immigration Laws with respect to the Transferred SSD Employees.

 

(i) _Transfer Agreements_. Solely with respect to SSD Business Employees
located in the Peoples Republic of China, Canada, Mexico and Taiwan, the
Seller Parent and the Employing Subsidiaries, as applicable, and the Buyer
Parent or a relevant employing Buyer, as applicable, will each use reasonable
best efforts to enter into tripartite agreements with each other and the
applicable SSD Business Employees, employer substitution agreements or similar
agreements to effectuate the transfer of the employment of the applicable SSD
Business Employees to, and the assumption of the terms and conditions of the
employment of the applicable SSD Business Employees by, the Buyer Parent or a
Buyer, as applicable, as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 6.1 _for SSD
Business Employees who are not Automatic Transfer Employees (each such
agreement, a " _Transfer Agreement_ ").

(j)   _Transferred SSD Employee Replacement Awards_. No later than eight
(8) weeks prior to the First Closing Date, Seller Parent shall provide Buyer
Parent with a schedule of all outstanding Restricted Stock Units granted to
each SSD Business Employee (the " _SSD Business Employee RSUs_ "), including
award type (i.e., time-based restricted stock unit or performance-based
restricted stock unit), number of shares of Seller Parent common stock covered
by or subject to the award (including, with respect to performance-based
awards, the target and maximum number of shares), grant date, the Employee
Plan under which the award was granted, and vesting schedule (the " _SSD
Business Employee Equity Award Schedule_ "). Seller Parent shall provide
Buyer Parent with an updated SSD Business Employee Equity Award Schedule no
later than ten (10) days prior to the First Closing Date. Subject to
applicable Law, (i) effective as of the First Closing, for each discrete
grant of SSD Business Employee RSUs, Seller Parent shall vest a number of SSD
Business Employee RSUs equal to the number of such awards that would have
vested if the applicable Transferred SSD Business Employee
continued employment with Seller Parent or an Affiliate thereof through the
next annual vesting date multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of whole months elapsed between the annual vesting date immediately
preceding the First Closing Date and the denominator of which is twelve (it
being understood that such vested SSD Business Employee RSUs shall be settled
in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement), (ii) as soon
as administratively practicable following the First Closing, Buyer Parent
shall, or shall cause the relevant employing Buyer to, grant to each
Transferred SSD Employee a cash incentive award that is equivalent in value
to, and is on terms and conditions that are no less favorable than, and
have the same remaining vesting schedule of, those SSD Business Employee RSUs
that are forfeited by such Transferred SSD Employee as of the First Closing
Date, and (iii) as soon as administratively practicable following the First
Closing, Buyer Parent shall, or shall cause the relevant employing Buyer to,
grant to each Transferred SSD Employee a cash incentive award that is
equivalent in value to, and is on terms and conditions (other than those
related to "retirement" or "change in control" vesting) that are
substantially comparable to, the most recent equity award granted to such
Transferred SSD Employee by Seller Parent.

6.2 _Second Closing_. __

 

(a) _Transfer of NAND Business Employees_. Following the execution of this
Agreement, the Seller Parent shall cause (y) China OpCo to offer employment
in writing (and, if required by applicable Law to effectuate the transfer of
any Business Employee, accompanied by an employment contract), to be effective
on the Restructuring Effective Date, to the NAND Business Employees then
located in China and (z) U.S. OpCo to offer employment, to be effective on the
Restructuring Effective Date, to the NAND Business Employees then located in
the U.S., in each case including terminating the employment of such NAND
Business Employees and entering into any employment agreement with the
applicable OpCo as required by applicable Law to effectuate the transfer of
any such Business Employee. Each NAND Business Employee whose
employment transfers to OpCo shall be referred to herein as a " _Transferred
NAND Employee_." Prior to the Second Closing Date, the Seller Parent shall
cause OpCo to offer employment in writing, to be effective as of the Second
Closing, to any NAND Business Employees not located in China or the U.S., in
each case including terminating the employment of such NAND Business Employees
and entering into any employment agreement with the applicable OpCo as
required by applicable Law to effectuate the transfer of any such NAND
Business Employee. The Seller Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to enable each NAND Business Employee who is a foreign national requiring a
visa or work permit in order to work for OpCo in his or her current position
to continue to be eligible to work in such position as a Transferred NAND
Employee following the Restructuring Effective Date or Second Closing, as
applicable, which efforts may include, but not be limited to,
amending current visa petitions to properly reflect any new employing entity
or position. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to provide continued
short-term or long-term disability benefits under an Employee Plan following
the Second Closing for those Transferred NAND Employees who are on short-term
or long-term disability benefits under an Employee Plan immediately prior to
the Second Closing. Effective as of the Second Closing, and for a period of
twelve (12) months thereafter, the relevant employing OpCo or Buyer, as
applicable, shall provide to each Transferred NAND Employee, for so long as
such Transferred NAND Employee remains employed during such period total
direct compensation and benefits equal to or greater than the amount of such
total direct compensation and benefits that each such Transferred NAND
Employees is entitled to receive immediately prior to the Second Closing (not
including any retention bonus awarded to any such Transferred NAND Employee by
Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates). Subject to applicable Law, effective
as of Second Closing and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, the
relevant employing Buyer shall provide (or cause OpCo to provide) to each
Transferred NAND Employee, for so long as such Transferred NAND Employee
remains employed during such period, (i) at least the same wage rate or base
salary as in effect for such Transferred NAND Employee as of immediately prior
to the Second Closing, (ii) target annual cash bonus opportunities and
quarterly profit-sharing bonus opportunities that are no less favorable than
as in effect for the applicable Transferred NAND Employee immediately prior to
the Second Closing, and (iii) employee health, welfare and retirement
benefits (other than defined benefit pension or post-employment welfare plans)
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those in effect for the
applicable Transferred NAND Employee immediately prior to the Second Closing.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer Parent and its Affiliates shall be
responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Parent and
its Affiliates against, all compensation and benefits under a plan, practice,
agreement or arrangement of Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates or that
Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates is party to, and relating to the
employment or service or termination of employment or service by the
Buyer Parent and its Affiliates of Transferred NAND Employees in respect of
any period after the Second Closing.

 



96

    

(b) _NAND Business Employee List Update_. On or before the Second Closing
Date, the Seller Parent shall update the NAND Business Employee List to
reflect changes permitted by this Agreement (the " _Final NAND Business
Employee List_ ").

 

(c) _Transferred NAND Employee Replacement Awards_. No later than six (6)
weeks prior to each of the Restructuring Effective Date and Second Closing
Date, Seller Parent shall provide Buyer Parent with a schedule of all
outstanding Restricted Stock Units granted to each NAND Business Employee (the

restricted stock unit or performance-based restricted stock unit), number of
shares of Seller Parent common stock covered by or subject to the award
(including, with respect to performance-based awards, the target and maximum
number of shares), grant date, the Employee Plan under which the award was
granted, and vesting schedule (the " _NAND Business Employee Equity Award
Schedule_ "). Seller Parent shall provide Buyer Parent with an updated NAND
Business Employee Equity Award Schedule no later than ten (10) days prior to
each of the Restructuring Effective Date and the Second Closing Date. Subject
to applicable Law, (i) effective as of the Second Closing, for each discrete
grant of NAND Business Employee RSUs, Seller Parent shall vest a number of
NAND Business Employee RSUs equal to the number of such awards that would have
vested if the applicable Transferred NAND Business Employee continued
employment with Seller Parent or an Affiliate thereof through the next annual
vesting date multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
whole months elapsed between the annual vesting date immediately preceding
the Second Closing Date and the denominator of which is twelve (it being
understood that such vested NAND Business Employee RSUs shall be settled in
accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement), (ii) as soon as
administratively practicable following the Second Closing, Buyer Parent
shall, or shall cause OpCo to, grant to each Transferred NAND Employee a cash
incentive award that is equivalent in value to, and is on terms and conditions
that are no less favorable than, and have the same remaining vesting schedule
of, those NAND Business Employee RSUs that are forfeited by such Transferred
NAND Employee as of the Second Closing Date, and (iii) as soon as
administratively practicable following the Second Closing, Buyer Parent

6.3 _Miscellaneous._

 

(a) _Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule lists each Business
Employee who is or, since January 1, 2019, has been at any time at grade
level 11 or above (each, a " _Senior Business Employee_ "). Within one (1)
month following the date hereof, the Seller Parent shall (x) update 
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(a)_ of the Disclosure Schedule to include the name of each
Senior Business Employee who has provided his or her consent to so include his
or her name and the date on which such Senior Business Employee was assigned
to his/her current division and (y) deliver to the Buyer Parent a reasonably
detailed description of the then-current function and responsibilities of such
Senior Business Employee for the Business.

 

(b) Subject to any more favorable requirements under applicable Law, for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, vesting, determination of
level of benefits and benefit accruals, Transferred Employees employment
service with the Seller Parent and its Affiliates (or predecessor employers to
the extent the Seller Parent and its Affiliates provide past service credit)
shall

 



97

    

 be treated as employment service with the Buyer Parent or the relevant
employing Buyer with respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy
or arrangement (including severance plans, policies or arrangements and paid
time off, vacation and sick leave policies but excluding equity and bonus
plans) maintained by the Buyer Parent or the relevant employing Buyer
following the applicable Closing for the benefit of any
Transferred Employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that such prior employment
service shall not be recognized to the extent that (i) such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) such service was not recognized
under a comparable Employee Plan immediately prior to the applicable Closing,
(iii) such service has already been recognized for the purpose of any benefit
which has accrued in full prior to or on the applicable Closing Date, or (iv)
except as required by applicable Law, for purposes of any defined benefit
pension plan or post-retirement welfare plan. Subject to any more favorable
requirements under applicable Law, for purposes of employee cost sharing under
any employee group medical or health and welfare plan, the Buyer Parent
shall, or shall cause a Buyer to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide that any employee copayments or deductibles paid or payable by a
Transferred Employee under any Employee Plan in the year of transfer shall be
recognized by the Buyer Parent or relevant employing Buyer as an employee
copayment or deductible under an employee group medical or health and welfare
plan covering the Transferred Employee in the year of transfer.

 

(c) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 5.21(c)_, nothing contained in this
_ARTICLE VI_ or any other provision of this Agreement, whether express or
implied, shall be construed to (i) create any third party beneficiary or other
rights in any current or former employee, director, consultant, or independent
contractor of the Seller Parent or its Affiliates (including any dependent or
beneficiary thereof) or any other Person (including any union, works council,
or collective bargaining representative or any participant in any Employee
Plan (or any dependent or beneficiary thereof)) or any other employee benefit
plan, program or agreement sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the
Sellers, the Buyer Parent, the Buyer or their respective Affiliates other than
the Parties to this Agreement, (ii) create any right to employment or
continued employment for any specified period or to a particular term or
condition of employment, or otherwise interfere with the rights of the Seller
Parent, the Buyer Parent or the relevant Buyer or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any employee benefit plans at
any time, discharge or discipline any employee, or change the terms of
employment of any employee, or (iii) amend, terminate or otherwise modify any
employee benefit plan of the Seller Parent, the Buyer Parent or the relevant
Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent the
Seller Parent, the Buyer Parent or the relevant Buyer, and their respective
Subsidiaries comply with applicable Laws.

 

(d) On or before the date that Seller Parent or the applicable Subsidiary
generally pays annual or quarterly bonuses to its employees, the Seller
Parent shall, or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, pay the Transferred
SSD Employees or Transferred NAND Employees, as applicable, a prorated bonus
under any applicable Employee Plan (other than any OpCo Employee Plan) for
the fiscal year or quarter, as applicable, of the Seller Parent in which First
Closing or the Second Closing, as applicable, occurs based upon the portion of
the applicable bonus plan year or quarter, as applicable, through the First
Closing or the Second Closing, as applicable, and based on actual performance
through such date.

(e) Subject to the requirements under applicable Law and the terms of the
Employee Plan, effective as of the First Closing or the Second Closing, as
applicable, each Transferred SSD Employee and Transferred NAND Employee,
respectively shall cease participation in each Employee Plan (other than, for
Transferred NAND Employees, each OpCo Employee Plan, if any). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Seller Parent or its applicable Subsidiary shall retain (i)
all Liabilities 

 



98

    

 with respect to claims incurred by each Transferred SSD Employee and
Transferred NAND Employee (and, in either case, their beneficiaries and
covered dependents) prior to the First Closing and Second Closing,
respectively, under the Employee Plans (other than, for Transferred NAND
Employees, each OpCo Employee Plan, if any) that provide medical, dental,
vision and prescription drug coverage, life, accidental death and
dismemberment and business travel accident insurance and disability coverage,
and (ii) all Liabilities in respect of, and shall remain responsible for all
claims for, workers compensation benefits that are incurred prior to First
Closing or the Second Closing, as applicable. For purposes of this _Section_
__ _ 6.3(e)_, the following claims shall be deemed to be incurred as follows:
(A) with respect to short-term disability, long-term disability, life and
accidental death and dismemberment benefits, upon the event giving rise to
such benefits; (B) with respect to medical, dental, vision care, prescription
and health-related benefits, upon provision of medical, dental, vision,

claim occurs.

 

(f) The Seller Parent shall promptly notify the Buyer Parent if any Key
Employee or Senior Business Employee provides, prior to the First Closing or
the Second Closing, as applicable, formal, written notice to resign from
employment or is otherwise not employed by the Seller Parent or its applicable
Subsidiary immediately prior to the First Closing or the Second Closing, as
applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, such
notifications shall not be considered or treated as a supplement to or
amendment of the Disclosure Schedule for purposes of  _Section_ __ _ 5.8_.
After the date of this Agreement, to the extent any Key Employees employment
with Seller Parent is terminated (due to death or disability, as a result of a
resignation, or as a result of a termination by the Seller Parent pursuant to
this Agreement) or is no longer a Business Employee (pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement), Seller Parent and Buyer Parent shall reasonably cooperate to
select a replacement for such Key Employee. For the avoidance of doubt, once
the Parties have selected a replacement for such Key Employee, such employee
will be considered to be a Key Employee for purposes of this Agreement.

 

(g) The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to facilitate the actions
contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_. Following the date of this Agreement
and prior to the First Closing or the Second Closing, as applicable, each of
the Buyer Parent, the Buyers, the Seller Parent and the Employing Subsidiaries
shall comply with their respective requirements to notify, consult, discuss
or negotiate with any Employee Representative Body and any Governmental Entity
(and shall convene meetings of the appropriate Employee Representative Bodies
as soon as reasonably practicable with a view to complying with such
requirements), under the terms of any applicable contract, company regulation
or collective agreement or Labor Agreement or any applicable Law in connection
with the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Parties shall
cooperate and use good faith efforts to provide such assistance that is
reasonably requested by the other Party for such purpose (within the timeframe
so requested.

 

(h) Following the First Closing Date, but prior to the Second Closing
Date, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to establish OpCo Employee
Plans deemed necessary or required by the Buyer Parent and its Affiliates;
_provided_ that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties, any
such OpCo Employee Plan shall become effective as of the Second Closing Date.

(i) Following the date hereof, but prior to the First Closing Date or the
Second Closing Date, as applicable, to the extent that any Contracts with
third party service providers providing contingent workers to the Business do
not become Transferred Contracts, the Parties shall cooperate in 

 



99

    

 good faith to facilitate the Buyer Parent or one of the other Buyers
negotiation of new agreements with third party service providers providing
contingent workers to the Business.

_TAX MATTERS_

7.1 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_.

 

(a) Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to the
other Parties such cooperation, documentation and information as either of
them reasonably may request in (i) filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return
or claim for refund, (ii) determining a Liability for Taxes or a right to
refund of Taxes or (iii) conducting any Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing necessary powers of attorney, copies of
all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with all relevant
portions of relevant accompanying schedules and relevant work papers,
relevant documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Tax
Authorities, and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of
property and other information, which any such Party may possess. Each Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make its employees reasonably
available on a mutually convenient basis at its cost to provide an explanation
of any documents or information so provided. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, at the request of the Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates,
the Buyer Parent shall, and shall cause any of its Affiliates to, reasonably
cooperate with the Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates in the preparation
of any Tax Return or other documentation or certification required to
establish the eligibility of all or any portion of the purchase price
described in _Section_ __ _ 2.13_ as "foreign-derived deduction eligible
income" within the meaning of Section 250(b)(4) of the Code; _provided_ that
(1) the Seller Parent shall reimburse the Buyer Parent for any reasonable,
out-of-pocket third party fees and expenses incurred by the Buyer Parent and
any of its Affiliates in providing such cooperation, (2) such cooperation
shall not include participation in any Tax Proceeding unless required by an
applicable Tax Authority, and (3) except with respect to any breach of this
Agreement, the Seller Parent agrees and acknowledges that the Buyer Parent
shall not be required to bear any Taxes payable due to the failure of all or
any portion of the purchase price to qualify as "foreign-derived deduction
eligible income" within the meaning of Section 250(b)(4) of the Code.

 

(b) Each Party shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules, work papers and
other documents solely relating to OpCo and the Transferred Assets with
respect to Tax matters until ninety (90) days after the expiration of the

7.2 _V_ _AT_.

 

(a) Without prejudice to _Section_ __ _ 2.15_, all sums payable under or
pursuant to this Agreement, including, for avoidance of doubt, the Purchase
Price, are (unless expressly stated otherwise) exclusive of any applicable
VAT. Where, under or pursuant to this Agreement, any Person (the " _Supplier_
") makes a supply or renders a service, including, for avoidance of doubt, of
the Business (or part of the Business) to any other Person (the " _Recipient_
") for VAT purposes and the Supplier or an Affiliate of the Supplier is
required to account for VAT in respect of that supply, the Recipient shall,
subject to the receipt of a valid VAT invoice, pay to the Supplier an amount
equal to such VAT in addition to any other consideration for that supply. Such
payment shall be made:

 

(i) together with and at the same time as the Purchase Price to the extent
that the supply in question is of the Business (or part of the Business); and

(ii) in any other case, within ten (10) Business Days of demand or, if later,
at the same time as any such consideration is payable.

The Recipient shall provide the Supplier with all relevant or necessary
information in relation thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer Parent
(or any of its Affiliates) shall, subject to the receipt of a valid VAT
invoice, pay to the Sellers (or an Affiliate of the Sellers) an amount equal
to any VAT the Supplier or an Affiliate of the Supplier is required to
account for in respect of the sale of the Transferred Assets in addition to
the Purchase Price.

 

(b) If, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_, the Recipient pays an amount
in respect of VAT to the Supplier or Affiliate of the Supplier and it is
subsequently finally determined by a Tax Authority in writing that no VAT (or
a lesser amount of VAT) was due in respect of the supply in question (either
because the supply constituted a transfer of a going concern or slump sale or
because it falls within any other applicable exemption from VAT) (the amount
paid by the Recipient in respect of the VAT amount which was not due being an
" _Overpaid Amount_ "), then the Supplier or Affiliate of the Supplier shall
pay to the Recipient any amount it recovers from, or is repaid by, such Tax
Authority relating to such Overpaid Amount within ten (10) Business Days of
its receipt of such recovery or repayment.

 

(c) No Seller or Buyer shall with respect to any of the Transactions waive
any exemptions from VAT unless with the written consent of the respective
other Party. The Seller Parent and the Buyer Parent shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, take all commercially reasonable steps to
minimize any VAT payable in connection with the Transactions.

7.3 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement and without prejudice to _Section_ __ _ 2.15_, subject to the
last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, the Buyer Parent shall
economically bear, and be responsible for, all applicable Transfer Taxes; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller Parent shall economically bear and be
responsible for all Chinese land appreciation, stamp and deed taxes, in each
case, relating to Chinese real property. The Party responsible under
applicable Law for filing the Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes
shall prepare and timely file such Tax Returns and promptly provide a copy of
such Tax Returns to the other Party. The Seller Parent and the Buyer Parent
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate to timely
prepare and file any Tax Returns or other filings relating to such Transfer
Taxes, including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or
imposition of any Transfer Taxes. The Seller Parent and the Buyer Parent
shall, and shall

 



101

    

 cause their respective Affiliates to, take all commercially reasonable steps
to minimize any Transfer Taxes with respect to this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_.

 

7.4 _A_ _pportioned Obligations_.

 

(a) _Each Closing_.

 

(i) _First Closing_. All real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and
similar ad valorem obligations levied with respect to the First Closing
Transferred Assets for a Tax period which includes (but does not end on) the
First Closing Date (collectively, the " _First Closing Apportioned
Obligations_ ") shall be apportioned between the Seller Parent and the Buyer
Parent based on the number of days of such Tax period up to and including the
First Closing Date (any such portion of such Tax period, the " _Pre-First
Closing Tax Period_") and the number of days of such Tax period after the
First Closing Date (any such portion of such taxable period, the " _Post-First
Closing Tax Period_ "). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the First
Closing Transactions result in the reassessment of the value of any of the
First Closing Transferred Assets for any such Tax purposes, or the imposition
of any such Taxes on such First Closing Transferred Assets at a rate which is
different than the rate that would have been imposed if such First Closing
Transactions had not occurred, then (y) the portion of such Taxes for the Pre-
First Closing Tax Period shall be determined on a daily basis, using
the assessed value and Tax rate that would have applied had such First
Closing Transactions not occurred, and (z) the portion of such Taxes for the
Post-First Closing Tax Period shall be the total Taxes for the Tax period
minus the amount described in clause (y) of this sentence. The Seller Parent
shall be liable for the apportioned amount of such Taxes that is attributable
to the Pre-First Closing Tax Period (and such apportioned amount shall
constitute a Retained Tax Liability), and the Buyer Parent shall be liable
for the apportioned amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Post-
First Closing Tax Period, including any amounts paid on or prior to the First
Closing Date (and such apportioned amount shall constitute a First Closing
Assumed Liability).

(ii) _Second Closing_. All (a) real property Taxes, personal property Taxes
and similar ad valorem obligations levied with respect to the Second Closing
Transferred Assets for a Tax period which includes (but does not end on) the
Second Closing Date (collectively, the " _Second Closing Property Apportioned
Obligations_ ") shall be apportioned between the Seller Parent and the Buyer
Parent based on the number of days of such Tax period up to and including the
Second Closing Date (any such portion of such Tax period, the "Pre-Second
Closing Tax Period" and with the Pre-First Closing Tax Period, each a " _Pre-
Closing Tax Period_") and the number of days of such Tax period after the
Second Closing Date (any such portion of such taxable period, the " _Post-
Second Closing Tax Period_ "), and (b) Taxes not described in clause (a) for a
Tax period which includes (but does not end on) the Second Closing Date
(together with the Second Closing Property Apportioned Obligations, the "
_Second Closing Apportioned Obligations_ ") shall be apportioned as if such
period ended on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if
the Second Closing Transactions result in the reassessment of the value of any
of the Second Closing Transferred Assets for any such Tax purposes, or the
imposition of any such Taxes on such Second Closing Transferred Assets at a
rate which is different than the rate that would have been imposed if such
Second Closing Transactions had not occurred, then (y) the portion of such
Taxes for the Pre-Second Closing Tax Period shall be determined on a daily
basis, using the assessed value and Tax rate that would have applied had such
Second Closing Transactions not 

 



102

    

 occurred, and (z) the portion of such Taxes for the Post-Second Closing Tax
Period shall be the total Taxes for the Tax period minus the amount described
in clause (y) of this sentence. The Seller Parent shall be liable for the
apportioned amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Pre-Second
Closing Tax Period (and such apportioned amount shall constitute a Retained
Tax Liability), and the Buyer Parent shall be liable for the apportioned
amount of such Taxes that is attributable to the Post-Second Closing Tax
Period, including any amounts paid on or prior to the Second Closing Date (and
such apportioned amount shall constitute an Assumed Liability).

(b) The Party required by applicable Law to pay any Apportioned
Obligations shall timely pay the Apportioned Obligations and shall timely
file, as provided by applicable Law, any Tax Returns relating to such
Apportioned Obligations. The paying Party shall be entitled to reimbursement
from the non-paying Party in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.4(a)_. Upon
payment of any such Apportioned Obligation, the Party making the payment shall
present a statement to the other Party setting forth the amount of
reimbursement to which the Party making the payment is entitled under
_Section_ __ _ 7.4(a)_ together with such supporting evidence as is
reasonably necessary to calculate the amount to be reimbursed. The non-paying
Party shall make such reimbursement before the later of ten (10) days after
the presentation of such statement and five (5) days before the due date.

 

(c) To the extent that the Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates receives
any cash refund of (or utilizes any credit arising from an overpayment of)
Taxes that constitute Retained Tax Liabilities, it shall pay-over the amount
of such refund or credit to the Seller Parent within thirty (30) days
of receipt or utilization thereof, net of (i) any reasonable expenses
incurred by the Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with
receiving such refund or credit, and (ii) any Liability for Tax imposed on the
Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with receiving such
refund or credit. The Buyer Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use good faith efforts to secure any such refund or credit; _provided_ , that
the Buyer Parent and its Affiliates shall not be obligated to file any
amended Tax Returns to the extent such filing could reasonably be determined
to adversely affect the Buyer Parent or any of its Affiliates.

 

7.5 _Tax Treatment_. Except as otherwise provided pursuant to Section
2.13, the Parties agree to treat the First Closing Transactions and the
Second Closing Transactions as two (2) separate transactions for all
applicable Tax purposes. The Parties shall not, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to not, take any position or action inconsistent with
such treatment except upon a final determination by an applicable Tax
Authority.

 

7.6 _Tax Returns_. The Buyer Parent shall prepare and timely file, or
cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns with respect or
relating to the Transferred Assets that are due after the applicable Closing
Date that relate, in whole or in part, to any Retained Tax Liability or
any Pre-Closing Tax Period (each such Tax Return, a " _Buyer Prepared Return_
"), and shall timely remit, or cause to be remitted, to the appropriate Tax
Authority all Taxes reflected on such Buyer Prepared Returns. The Buyer
Parent shall provide to the Seller Parent each Buyer Prepared Return at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such Buyer Prepared Return
(or, if such Buyer Prepared Return is due within thirty (30) days of an
applicable Closing Date, as soon as practicable). At least fifteen (15) days
prior to the due date for the filing of any such Buyer Prepared Return (or if
such Tax Return is not provided to the Seller Parent at least thirty (30)
days prior to its due date, as soon as practicable), the Seller Parent shall
(a) notify the Buyer Parent of the existence of any comments the Seller Parent
may have to any items set forth on any such Buyer Prepared Return
(which comments the Seller Parent shall incorporate to the extent such

 



103

    

 comments are reasonable and consistent with applicable Law), and (b) pay to
the Buyer Parent the amount of any Taxes reflected on such Tax Return to the
extent any such amount constitutes Retained Tax Liabilities. The Buyer Parent
shall not file, and shall not permit the filing of, any Buyer Prepared Return
described in the previous sentence without the Seller Parents written
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned; provided, that if the Seller Parent has not provided its consent
with respect to any Buyer Prepared Return in advance of the applicable due
date of such Tax Return, the Buyer Parent shall be entitled to file, or cause
to be filed, such Tax Return by the applicable due date and the parties shall
work in good faith to resolve any outstanding disagreements with respect to
such Tax Return and file an amended version of such Tax Return, if necessary
to reflect the resolution of any such disagreements. The Buyer Parent
acknowledges and agrees that it will not object to, and will provide any
necessary consents or waivers to permit, the engagement by the Seller Parent
of any Person the Seller Parent reasonably proposes to engage for purposes of
reviewing the Tax Returns referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_, unless the
Buyer Parent would be adversely affected by such engagement (as determined in
the Buyer Parents good faith). Unless otherwise required by applicable Law,
each Buyer Prepared Return shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent
with past practice of the Seller Parent and/or its Affiliates and, on such Tax
Returns, no position shall be taken, election made or method adopted that is
inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods used in preparing
and filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods (including positions,
elections or methods that would have the effect of accelerating any income or
gain to, or deferring any deduction, loss or credit from, any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, as applicable).

 

7.7 _Certain Post-Closing Tax Matters_. None of the Buyer Parent or any of
its Affiliates (including, after the Second Closing, OpCo) will or will
permit or cause any Person to: (a) file (other than in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 7.6_) or amend any Tax Return with respect to any Transferred
Asset that relates, in whole or in part, to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any
Retained Tax Liability, including pursuant to any voluntary disclosure; (b)
make any Tax election or change any method of the Tax accounting that has an
effect on any Tax Return relating to any Transferred Asset or Retained Tax
Liability; (c) agree to extend or waive the statute of limitations with
respect to any Tax or Tax Return relating to any Transferred Asset in respect
of any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Retained Tax Liability; or (d) make any
election pursuant to Section 336 or Section 338 of the Code or the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (or pursuant to any corresponding
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law) with respect to the Transactions,
in each case except (x) if such action would not reasonably be expected to
increase the liability of the Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates for
Taxes that are Retained Tax Liabilities; provided, to the extent the Buyer
Parent or any of its Affiliates intend to take any action described in the
foregoing clauses (a)-(d) that would not reasonably be expected to increase
the liability of the Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates for Taxes that are
Retained Tax Liabilities, the Buyer Parent shall provide, or cause to be
provided, written notice of such action to the Seller Parent reasonably in
advance of taking such action and prior to taking any such action, the Buyer
Parent shall consider in good faith any objection to any such action asserted
in writing by the Seller Parent, or (y) with the prior written consent of the
Seller Parent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

9.1(a)(ii)(A)_ shall not be available to any Party whose failure or
whose Affiliates failure to perform any covenant or obligation under this
Agreement has been the primary cause of or has primarily resulted in the
failure of the First Closing Transactions to be consummated on or before the
Outside Date;

 

(B) (1) any law or statute enacted or promulgated by a Governmental Entity
of competent jurisdiction in any Applicable Jurisdiction makes illegal the

later than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or
cause to be paid to the Buyer Parent an amount equal to (A) US$140,000,000 in
the event that this Agreement is terminated before the First Closing or (B)
US$40,000,000 in the event that this Agreement is terminated after the First
Closing and before the Second Closing (such amount in _clause (A)_ or _(B)_ ,
as the case may be, the " _Legal Challenge Liquidated Damages_ ") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (in U.S. dollars) to such account or
accounts as may be designated in writing by the Buyer Parent. If the Seller
Parent fails to pay the Legal Challenge Liquidated Damages when due, and, in
order to obtain such payment, the Buyer Parent commences an Action that
results in a judgment against the Seller Parent for the Legal Challenge
Liquidated Damages, the Seller Parent shall pay to the Buyer Parent, together
with the Legal Challenge Liquidated Damages, interest on the Legal Challenge
Liquidated Damages from the date of termination of this Agreement until the
date of payment in full of all amounts due and payable pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.3_ at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate. Subject to
the immediately preceding sentence and the provisos at the end of this
sentence, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, payment of the Legal Challenge Liquidated Damages will be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Parties upon termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 9.3(f)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing will not be deemed a waiver by any Party of
any right or remedy arising by reason of any claim of fraud with respect to
this Agreement against the Party committing such fraud; _provided_ , _further_
, that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to any breach by the Seller
Parent, or any other Buyer(s) party thereto, of the Manufacturing and Sale
Agreement (the remedy for which shall be governed by the Manufacturing and
Sale Agreement).

 



117

    

(g) Each Party acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, that, solely for purposes of establishing the basis for the
amounts thereof, and without in any way increasing the amount of Termination
Liquidated Damages or Legal Challenge Liquidated Damages, as applicable,
or expanding the circumstances in which Termination Liquidated Damages or
Legal Challenge Liquidated Damages, as applicable, are to be paid, the payment
of any Termination Liquidated Damages or Legal Challenge Liquidated Damages,
as applicable, is not a penalty but is liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate the applicable Party and its Affiliates, in the
circumstances in which such damages are payable, for the efforts and resources
expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and
in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. The Parties further acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, were a
material inducement for the Parties to enter into this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, the Parties would not have entered into this
Agreement.

9.4 _Extension; Waiver_.

 

(a) _First Closing_. At any time prior to the First Closing, the Seller
Parent, on the one hand, or the Buyer Parent, on the other hand, may (i)
extend the time for performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other Party, which obligations or acts were to occur prior to the First
Closing, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other Party made in this Agreement as of the date hereof and/or the First
Closing Date or in any document delivered on or prior to the First Closing
pursuant to this Agreement, or (iii) waive compliance by the other Party with

each case on or prior to the First Closing and as set forth in this Agreement.

Parent, on the one hand, or the Buyer Parent, on the other hand, may (i)

other Party, which obligations or acts were to occur prior to the Second
Closing, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other Party made in this Agreement as of the Second Closing Date or in any
document delivered after the First Closing but prior to the Second Closing
pursuant to this Agreement, or (iii) waive compliance by the other Party with
(A) the delivery of any agreements or (B) any conditions it is to satisfy, in
each case after the First Closing but prior to the Second Closing and as set
forth in this Agreement.

 

Any extension or waiver granted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party
granting such extension or waiver.

the Purchase Price; _provided_ , _however_ , in all cases, that the liability
for indemnification arising from fraud shall not be subject to any limitation.

(iv) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification
under Section 10.2(a)(i)(B) or Section 10.2(a)(i)(C) for (A) any item
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule in reasonable detail to allow the Buyer

their respective Representatives (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ," and
collectively with the Buyer Indemnified Parties, the " _Indemnified Parties_
," and each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") from and against all Losses suffered
or incurred by any such Seller Indemnified Party arising out of, relating to
or incurred by reason of:

(A) the failure to timely satisfy in full any Assumed Liability;

 

(B) the failure of any representation or warranty of the Buyer Parent in this
Agreement to be true, complete and correct on the date of this Agreement

representation), except that any such representations and warranties which by
their express terms are made solely as of particular date shall be true,
complete and correct only as of such date; and

(C) any breach or failure by the Buyer Parent, or by any other Buyer to
perform any of their respective covenants or agreements hereunder, including

the Deductible. With respect to any claim as to which a Seller Indemnified
Party may be entitled to indemnification under  _Section_ __ _
10.2(b)(i)(B)_, the Buyer Parent shall not be liable for any individual or
series of related Losses which do not exceed the Sub-Basket.

indemnification for Losses suffered or incurred by any such Seller Indemnified
Party to the extent arising out of or incurred by reason of any Seller
Indemnified Partys willful misconduct.

(v) In no event shall any Buyer Indemnified Party be liable for any Retained
Liability.

 

(c) The amount of any and all Losses under this _ARTICLE X_ shall be
determined net of (i) insurance, indemnity, contribution or other third party
recoveries paid to any Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving
rise to the right of indemnification (net of any fees and expenses incurred in
obtaining any such insurance, indemnity or contribution payment or other
recovery, including any increase in insurance premiums), it being agreed that,
promptly after the realization of any such reductions of Losses pursuant
hereto, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for such
reduction in Losses for which such Indemnified Party was indemnified by such
Indemnifying Party prior to the realization of such reductions of Losses, and
(ii) any net Tax benefit actually recognized by such Indemnified Party with
respect to such Loss in the taxable year such Loss is incurred, calculated on
a with-and-without basis and taking into account the net present value of any
decrease in deductions attributable to treating any amount paid under this
_ARTICLE X_ in respect of such Loss as an adjustment to the Final First
Closing Purchase Price or Second Closing Purchase Price, as applicable,
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.2(g)_. Neither the Seller Parent nor
the Buyer Parent shall be liable under this Agreement in respect of any
Indemnification Claim to the extent that the Losses in respect of which
such Indemnification Claim is made are covered by a policy of insurance (net
of any fees and expenses that would reasonably be expected to be incurred in
obtaining any such insurance payment, excluding any increase in insurance
premiums).

 

(d) If an Indemnified Party recovers Losses from an Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 10.2_, the Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such recovery, to the Indemnified Partys rights
against any third party with respect to such recovered Losses, subject to the
subrogation rights of any insurer providing insurance coverage under one of
the Indemnified Partys policies and except to the extent that the grant of
subrogation rights to the Indemnifying Party is prohibited by the terms of the
applicable insurance policy.

(e) In respect of any Indemnification Claim resulting from a claim for
money damages which is based upon a contingent Liability, the Seller Parent
shall not be liable for indemnification unless and until such contingent
Liability gives rise to an obligation to make a payment.

 

(f) In no event may an Indemnified Party be entitled under this Agreement
to multiple recovery for the same Losses.

 



122

    

(g) Any amount paid under this _ARTICLE X_  shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Final First Closing Purchase Price or Second Closing
Purchase Price, as applicable, for all Tax purposes except as required by
applicable Laws.

 

10.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) An Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the other Party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing (such notice, a " _Claim Notice_ ") of any
claim or demand that the Indemnified Party has determined gives such
Indemnified Party a right to indemnification under this Agreement (including a
claim or demand asserted by a third party against any Indemnified Party, such
claim being a " _Third Party Claim_ ") (an " _Indemnification Claim_ "). Each
Claim Notice will, with respect to each Indemnification Claim set forth
therein (to the extent known by the Indemnified Party): (i) specify in
reasonable detail and in good faith the nature of the Indemnification Claim
being made, and (ii) state the aggregate dollar amount of Losses to which the
Indemnified Party claims to be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
_ARTICLE X_ that have been incurred, or a good faith estimate of the aggregate
dollar amount of such Losses reasonably expected to be incurred, by such
Indemnified Party pursuant to such Indemnification Claim (the "Claim
Amount"). The failure to provide prompt notice of a claim shall not release
the Indemnifying Party from any obligations under this _ARTICLE X_ except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced
by such failure.

(b) For Indemnification Claims other than Third Party Claims, if the
Indemnifying Party wishes to object to the allowance of some or all
Indemnification Claims made in a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party must
deliver a written objection to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days
after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such Claim Notice, expressing such
objection and explaining in reasonable detail and in good faith the basis
therefor. Following receipt by the Indemnified Party of the
Indemnifying Partys written objection, if any, the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party will promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days
after delivery of the written objection, meet to agree on the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each Indemnification Claim that is the
subject of such written objection. If the parties do not resolve the objection
in full within thirty (30) days of delivery of the written objection (or if
the Indemnifying Party fails to pay the agreed amount to the Indemnified
Party, in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 10.3(d)_, within the time agreed as
part of the resolution), then the Indemnified Party may seek to resolve any
remaining dispute in accordance with the terms of _Section_ __ _ 11.3_.

(c) For Indemnification Claims other than Third Party Claims, if the
Indemnified Party does not receive a response from the Indemnifying Party with
respect to any Indemnification Claim set forth in a Claim Notice by the end of
the thirty (30) day period referred to in  _Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)_, (i) the
Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to
object to such Indemnification Claim and to have agreed that Losses in the
amount of the applicable Claim Amount are indemnifiable hereunder, and (ii)
with respect to the applicable Indemnification Claim, as promptly as
practicable and in any event within three (3) Business Days following
expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party will pay
the Claim Amount to the Indemnified Party in accordance with _Section_ __ _
10.3(d)_. If not so paid, the Indemnified Party may seek enforcement of the
obligation of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with the terms of
_Section_ __ _ 11.3_.

(d) Any amount payable by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.3(c)_ will be paid
by the Indemnifying Party by wire transfer of

 



123

    

 immediately available funds (in U.S. dollars) to such account or accounts as
may be designated in writing by the Indemnified Party.

 

(e) For any Indemnification Claim that is a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall conduct the defense and control of such Third Party
Claim; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified
Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in, but not direct or conduct
the defense of, such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own
expense, except that the Indemnifying Party may withhold from the Indemnified
Party such communications with the Indemnifying Partys legal counsel to the
extent that legal counsel to the Indemnifying Party advises that providing
such communication could result in the loss of any attorney-client privilege
or right under the work-product doctrine of the Indemnifying Party in respect
of such claim. The Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause each of
its Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in
the defense of any Third Party Claim, including by furnishing books and
records, personnel and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such Third
Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party will have the right in its sole
discretion to settle any Third Party Claim so long as such settlement involves
only the payment of money and provides, in customary form, for the
unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all Liabilities in
connection with such Third Party Claim; for any other settlements the consent
of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, shall be required. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this _ARTICLE X_ , if a Third Party Claim is based
upon an assertion of a breach by the Seller Parent, or any other Buyer(s)
party thereto, of the Manufacturing and Sale Agreement, then the dispute
resolution procedures set forth in the Manufacturing and Sale Agreement shall
govern.

10.4 _Exclusive Remedy_. Subject to (a) the Parties rights under
_ARTICLE X_ with respect to termination of this Agreement after the First
Closing Date and (b) the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 10.3(e)_,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this
_ARTICLE X_ will be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties from and
after the First Closing Date for any claims arising under this Agreement,
including claims of inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing
will not be deemed a waiver by any Party of any right to seek specific
performance or injunctive relief pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.11_, or any
right or remedy arising by reason of any claim of fraud with respect to this
Agreement against the Party committing such fraud or any remedies available to
a Party under any other Transaction Agreement.

10.5 _Mitigation of Losses_. Any Indemnified Party hereunder shall
use reasonable best efforts and give all reasonable assistance to avoid or
mitigate any Losses which in the absence of mitigation might give rise to a
Liability in respect of any Indemnification Claim under this Agreement.

 

10.6 _Determination of Losses_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach
or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, and for
purposes of calculating the amount of Losses suffered by an Indemnified Party,
each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement in this Agreement and
any certificate or document delivered pursuant hereto shall be read without
regard and without giving effect to the term(s) "material," "Material Adverse
Effect" or any similar qualifier, as if such words and surrounding related
words (e.g., "reasonably be expected to" and similar restrictions and
qualifiers) were deleted from such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, except for such qualifications set forth therein to the extent it
qualifies an affirmative requirement to list specified items on the Disclosure
Schedule of a Party.

11.3 _Governing Law;_ ___Jurisdiction and Forum_.

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action based upon, arising
out of, or related to this Agreement or the Transactions, shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without
reference to the conflicts of law principles that would result in the
application of the Laws of a different jurisdiction.

(b) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ with respect to equitable or
injunctive relief, all disputes based upon, arising out of, or relating to the
interpretation or performance of this Agreement (each, a "Dispute") shall
first, upon notification by either Party, be discussed between
senior executive officers of each Party with authority to settle such
Disputes. Should such a Dispute not be settled within sixty (60) days after
such notification, either Party may commence litigation in the courts in the
State of Delaware or the Federal courts sitting therein. Each Party hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of those
courts for any Dispute, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that
all claims in respect of such Dispute may be heard and determined in such
court. Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent that it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such Dispute in the State of Delaware or the
Federal courts sitting therein. The Parties further agree, (i) to the extent
permitted by Law, that final judgment against any of them in any Dispute shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in any jurisdiction within or outside the
U.S. by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be conclusive
evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment and (ii) that service of
process upon such Party in any such Dispute shall be effective if such notice
is given in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 11.7_.

11.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the other
Transaction Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Manufacturing and
Sale Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto, constitutes
the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter
of this Agreement and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous discussion,
correspondence, negotiation, proposed term sheet, agreement, understanding or
arrangement, and there are no agreements, understandings, representations or
warranties between the Parties other than those set forth or referred to in
this Agreement.

11.5 _No Third Party Ben_ _eficiaries_. Except for (a) the Indemnified
Parties and (b) the Affiliates of the Seller Parent and their respective
Representatives (all of whom are express third party beneficiaries of 
_Section_ __ _ 5.21(c)_), this Agreement, including the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, is not intended to confer on or on behalf of any Person not
a party to this Agreement (and their successors and permitted assigns) any
rights, benefits, causes of action or remedies with respect to the subject
matter or any provision hereof.

 

11.6 _Costs and Expenses_. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement
(including  _Sections 5.12_ and _5.21(c)_ ), whether the Transactions are
consummated or not, all legal and other costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the Transaction Agreements and the Transactions shall be paid
by the Party incurring such costs and expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , that
each of the Buyer Parent (on the one hand) and the Seller Parent (on the other
hand) will pay (or cause payment of) and be responsible for fifty percent
(50%) of all filing fees payable (a) under the HSR Act and (b) in connection
with the solicitation of (i) any consents, clearances or approvals under or in
connection with any other Antitrust Laws, (ii) CFIUS Approval, and (iii) any
other Requisite Governmental Approvals. In relation to any costs and expenses
which, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, are being shared by the Buyer
Parent (on

 



126

    

 the one hand) and the Seller Parent (on the other hand), the sums which each
Party has incurred in respect of such costs and expenses shall be aggregated
and whichever of the Buyer Parent or the Seller Parent is then, on a net
basis, left with a payment obligation to the other Party (taking into account
the relevant proportions in which the relevant costs and expenses have been
shared under this Agreement) shall promptly make the applicable payment to
the other Party.

11.7 _Notices_. All notices and other communications to be given to any
Party hereunder shall be sufficiently given for all purposes hereunder if in
writing and: (i) upon delivery if delivered by hand; (ii) if by email, at the
time of transmission; (iii) on the first (1 _st_ ) Business Day following the

confirmed receipt or the fifth (5 _th_ ) Business Day following the date of

11.8 _Successors and_ _Permitted_ _Assigns_. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns (whether such succession or assignment is by
way of operation of law, merger, consolidation, sale of stock or shares, sale
of assets or otherwise);  _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to _Section_
__ _ 2.3_ (with respect to the First Closing) and _Section_ __ _ 2.8_ (with
respect to the Second Closing), no Party may directly or indirectly
(whether by way of operation of law, merger, consolidation, sale of stock or
shares, sale of assets or otherwise) assign any or all of its rights or
delegate any or all of its obligations under this Agreement to any Person
without the express prior written consent of the other Party. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party shall, prior to any
succession or assignment contemplated by the foregoing, take any and all
action required so that any successor or permitted assign assumes all of such
Partys obligations under this Agreement as if such successor or permitted
assign had originally executed this Agreement in place of such Party. Any
purported assignment or delegation in violation of the foregoing shall be
void. 

11.9 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be modified or
amended except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by the Party
against whom enforcement of any such modification or amendment is sought.
Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, any failure of the Seller Parent or the Buyer
Parent to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition
contained herein may be expressly waived in writing by the Seller Parent, in
the event of any such failure by the Buyer Parent, or by the Buyer Parent, in
the event of any such failure by the Seller Parent. No delay on the part of
the Buyer Parent or the Seller Parent in exercising any right, remedy, power
or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any waiver
by any Party of a breach of any term or provision of this Agreement
(including any waiver provided pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.4_) be construed
as a waiver of any subsequent breach or any other provision.

 

11.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a tribunal or court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as
the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



128

    

11.11 _Specific Performance_ _; Equitable Relief_.

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages
(even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that the Parties do not perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall be entitled, unless this
Agreement has been validly terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE IX_ , to
seek an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof (including, for the avoidance of doubt, to
cause the Buyer Parent and the Seller Parent to consummate the Transactions),
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law, in equity
or otherwise. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such order or injunction. Subject to
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_, the foregoing is in addition to any other remedy to
which any Party is entitled at Law, in equity or otherwise. Each Party agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
or other equitable relief on the basis that (i) any other Party has an
adequate remedy at law, or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The Parties further agree
that nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ shall require any Party
to institute any Action for (or limit any Partys right to institute any
Action for) specific performance under this _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ prior to
or as a condition to exercising any termination right under _ARTICLE IX_ (and
pursuing damages after such termination). The Parties acknowledge and agree
that the right to specific enforcement set forth in this _Section_ __ _
11.11_ is an integral part of the Agreement and without this right, neither
Party would have entered into this Agreement.

 

(b) Any action brought under this _Section_ __ _ 11.11_ may only be
brought before one of the courts having exclusive jurisdiction over Disputes
under _Section_ __ _ 11.3(a)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein (including in  _Section_ __ _ 11.3_), (i)
the Seller Parent may seek equitable relief in any court of competent
jurisdiction in order to protect Seller Confidential Information or its
Intellectual Property Rights and (ii) the Buyer Parent may seek equitable
relief in any court of competent jurisdiction in order to protect its
Intellectual Property Rights or, following the First Closing, Business
Confidential Information.

 

11.12 _No Right of Set-_ _Off_. Each of the Parties, for itself and for
its Affiliates, successors and permitted assigns, hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably waives any rights of set-off, netting, offset, recoupment or
similar rights that such Party or any of its Affiliates, successors
and permitted assigns has or may have with respect to any payment to be made
by such Party pursuant to this Agreement or any agreement, certificate,
instrument or other document executed and delivered by such Party in
connection herewith.

 

11.13 _Bulk Sale Laws_. The Parties hereby waive compliance with the
provisions of any bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Laws of any
jurisdiction that may be applicable with respect to the sale to the Buyers of
any or all of the Transferred Assets.

 

11.14 _No Admission_. Nothing herein shall be deemed an admission by the
Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates, in any Action or investigation
involving a third party, that the Seller Parent or such Affiliate or any such
third party is or is not in breach or violation of, or in default in, the
performance or observance of any term or provisions of any Contract.

 



129

    

11.15 _Further Assurances_.

 

(a) Each of the Parties shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates
to, from time to time at the request of the other Party, without any
additional consideration, furnish such requesting Party such further
information or assurances, execute and deliver such additional documents,
instruments and conveyances, and take such other actions and do such other
things, as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to carry out the
provisions of the Transaction Agreements, and give effect to the Transactions.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 11.15(a)_, but
subject to the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 11.15(b)_, if at any
time within the two (2) years following the relevant Closing either Party
becomes aware that any Transferred Asset (other than Patents) that should have
been assigned, transferred, conveyed or delivered to, or any Assumed
Liability that should have been assumed by, the Buyer Parent or the relevant
Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements,
was not transferred, assigned, conveyed or delivered to, or assumed by, the
Buyer Parent or the relevant Buyer as contemplated by this Agreement and the
Transaction Agreements, then (i) the Seller Parent shall, and shall cause the
Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates to, promptly assign, transfer,
convey or deliver such Transferred Asset to the Buyer Parent or one of the
other Buyers and (ii) the Buyer Parent or one of the other Buyers shall
promptly assume such First Closing Assumed Liability, in each case, for no
consideration and consistent with the terms of this Agreement. Any costs and
expenses associated with carrying out the obligations set forth in this
Section 11.15(b) shall be paid by the Seller Parent.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 11.15(a)_ if, at
any time within the two (2) years following the relevant Closing, either
Party becomes aware that any asset (other than Patents) that is not a
Transferred Asset and should have been retained by, or any Retained Liability
that should have been retained by, the Seller Parent or one of the other
Sellers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements
was assigned, transferred, conveyed or delivered to, or assumed by, the Buyer
Parent or one of the other Buyers, then (i) the Buyer Parent shall, and shall
cause the other Buyers to, promptly assign, transfer, convey or deliver such
asset to the Seller Parent or one of the other Sellers and (ii) the Seller
Parent shall, or shall cause one of the other Sellers to, promptly assume
such Retained Liability, in each case, for no consideration and consistent
with the terms of this Agreement. Any costs and expenses associated with
carrying out the obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 11.15(c)_
shall be paid by the Seller Parent.

11.16   _O_ _bligations of_ _Agreement on Affiliates_. Each of the Seller
Parent and the Buyer Parent shall cause its respective Affiliates to comply
with all obligations under this Agreement which are expressed to apply to any
such Affiliates.

11.17 _Time of_ _Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods
set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence. The
Parties acknowledge that each will be relying upon the timely performance by
the other of its obligations hereunder as a material inducement to such
partys execution of this Agreement.

11.18 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, and by any of the Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. The words "execution," 

 



130

    

 "signed," "signature," "delivery," and words of like import in or relating
to this Agreement or any agreement, instrument, certificate or other document
to be signed in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions shall be
deemed to include electronic signatures, deliveries or the keeping of records
in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity
or enforceability as a manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof
or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, and the
Parties hereby consent to the conduct of the Transactions by electronic means.
No Party may raise the use of electronic signatures, deliveries or the
keeping of records in electronic form, or the fact that any signature or
agreement or instrument was transmitted electronically, as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each Party hereby forever waives any such
defense, except to the extent that such defense relates to lack of
authenticity.
