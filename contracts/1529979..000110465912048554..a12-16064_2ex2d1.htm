The Merger Agreement has been provided solely to inform investors of its
terms. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and
covenants, which were made for the purposes of such agreement and as of
specific dates, were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger
Agreement and may be intended not as statements of fact, but rather as a way
of allocating risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be
inaccurate. In addition, such representations, warranties and covenants may be
subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the negotiated terms or with certain
disclosures not reflected in the text of the Merger Agreement, may not be
accurate or complete as of any specified date or may be subject to a
contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable
to stockholders or other investors in the Company. The Companys stockholders
and other investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger
Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants
or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts
or conditions of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates.

 **ARTICLE I**

 



 

 ** _THE OFFER_**

 



 

1.1 _The Offer_.

the Offer.

 



 

(b) The obligations of Merger Sub, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub, to

Minimum Condition and (ii) the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub of the
other conditions set forth in Annex I hereto (such conditions, together with
the Minimum Condition, the " **Offer Conditions** ") and the terms and
conditions hereof. Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to

any Offer Condition or any term of the Offer set forth in this Agreement, in
each case, in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares or (viii) abandon or
terminate the Offer, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, the
initial expiration date for the Offer shall be midnight, New York City time,

commenced, as determined in accordance with Rules 14d-1(g)(3) and 14d-2 of the
Exchange Act (such initial expiration date as it may be extended in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, the " **Expiration Date** "). Merger Sub
shall not, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub not to, terminate or withdraw the
Offer other than in connection with the effective termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, withdraw and terminate
the Offer promptly (and in any event within one Business Day) after the
effective termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_
(and promptly after any termination or withdrawal of the Offer, Merger Sub
shall return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to
return, all tendered shares of Company Common Stock to the registered holders
thereto, to the extent required by the terms of the Offer). Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause it to, extend the Offer for any period required by any
rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " **SEC** ") or the staff thereof or the New York Stock
Exchange (the " **NYSE** ") that is applicable to the Offer. If, at any then-
scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition has not been satisfied or
waived (other than any Offer Conditions that by their nature cannot be
satisfied until the closing of the Offer, which shall be required to be
satisfied or waived at the closing of the Offer), Merger Sub may, in its sole
discretion, and if requested in writing by the Company, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause it to (in each case unless this Agreement has been
terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_), extend the Offer for one or more
consecutive increments of not more than ten (10) Business Days each (the
length of such period to be determined by Parent and Merger Sub) until the
earlier to occur of (A) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article
VIII_, (B) the Outside Date (as in effect at the time of extension) and (C)
the satisfaction or waiver of all of the Offer Conditions. In addition, Merger
Sub may, and if requested in writing by the Company, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause it to, elect to provide for a "subsequent offering period"
of not less than ten (10) Business Days (or such other duration as reasonably
agreed by the parties) (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with
Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act if, prior to the commencement of such
"subsequent offering period," Parent and Merger Sub directly or indirectly own
(or would own after the actual exercise of the Top-Up Option) less than ninety
percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, the Offer
Documents shall reserve Merger Subs rights to effect a "subsequent offering
period" in accordance with this _Section 1.1(c)_. Nothing in this _Section
1.1(c)_ shall (i) impose any obligation on Merger Sub to (and Merger Sub shall
not without the prior written consent of the Company) extend the Offer or
provide for a "subsequent offering period" that extends beyond the Outside
Date then in effect, or (ii) be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict
in any manner the right of Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Article VIII_.

 



 

(d) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " **Offer to
Purchase** ") containing the applicable terms set forth in this Agreement and
be subject to the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ hereto. Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, on the terms and subject to the prior
satisfaction or waiver (if permitted) of the conditions of the Offer, accept
for payment and pay for all Tendered Shares promptly (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) and, unless the Outside Date has been
extended beyond December 31, 2012, in any event shall deposit the payment for
the Tendered Shares with the paying or transfer agent no later than December
31, 2012 (and Parent and Merger Sub shall

 



       
 

 



 

direct any transfer or paying agent to promptly pay for all accepted Tendered
Shares). If Merger Sub makes available a "subsequent offering period" in
accordance with _Section 1.1(c)_, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to accept for payment and pay for all Shares that are validly
tendered during such "subsequent offering period" promptly (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act) after any Shares are validly tendered
during such "subsequent offering period" and, unless the Outside Date has been
extended beyond December 31, 2012, in any event shall deposit the payment for
the Tendered Shares with the paying or transfer agent no later than December
31, 2012 (and Parent and Merger Sub shall direct any transfer or paying agent
to promptly pay for all accepted Tendered).

 



 

(e) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file
with the SEC in accordance with Rule 14d-3 and Regulation M-A under the
Exchange Act a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer, which shall contain as exhibits the Offer to Purchase, a related letter
of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule TO and the documents
included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto and including the exhibits thereto, the "
**Offer Documents** "), and cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to
the Stockholders as and to the extent required by United States federal
securities Laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder (the " **Federal Securities Laws** "). The Company shall promptly
provide to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company that
may be required by Federal Securities Laws or reasonably requested by Parent
or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Schedule TO. Parent and Merger Sub shall
cause the Offer Documents to comply in all material respects with the Federal
Securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide copies of the proposed
forms of the Offer Documents (including any amendments or supplements thereto)
to the Company within a reasonable time prior to the dissemination or filing
thereof for review and comment by the Company and its Representatives, and
shall consider in good faith any comments of the Company and its
Representatives. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall respond
promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer or
the Offer Documents and promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise
required by the Federal Securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall amend or
supplement the Offer Documents and cause the Offer Documents, as so amended or
supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the holders
of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Federal
Securities Laws and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Unless a Company Board Recommendation Change shall have occurred, Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its Representatives with copies of
any written comments, and shall inform them of any material oral comments,
that Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer or the Offer Documents promptly after the
receipt of such comments and shall give the Company a reasonable opportunity
under the circumstances to review and comment on any proposed written or
material oral responses to such comments. Unless a Company Board
Recommendation Change shall have occurred, Parent and Merger Sub shall use
reasonable best efforts to permit the Company and its Representatives to
participate with Parent and Merger Sub or their Representatives in any
discussions or meetings with the SEC. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Board Recommendation as it may
be amended or modified, and until but not after it is withdrawn, in each case
as permitted by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

1.2 _Company Actions_.

 



 

(a) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall
file a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
any amendments and supplements thereto and including the exhibits thereto, the
" **Schedule 14D-9** ") which, subject to _Section 5.2_, shall contain the
Company Board Recommendation. The Company shall include the Company Fairness
Opinion in the Schedule 14D-9. Parent shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
disseminated to the Stockholders along with the Offer Documents in accordance
with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act and Federal Securities Laws. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly provide to the Company all information
concerning Parent and Merger Sub that may be required by Federal Securities
Laws or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all material
respects with the Federal Securities Laws. The Company shall deliver copies of
the proposed form of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendments or
supplements thereto) to Parent within a reasonable time prior to the
dissemination or filing thereof for review and comment by Parent and its
Representatives, and shall consider in good faith any comments of Parent. Each
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall respond promptly to any comments
of the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 and promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to
the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by the Federal Securities Laws. The
Company shall amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and cause the Schedule
14D-9, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by the Federal Securities Laws. Unless a Company Board Recommendation
Change shall have occurred, the Company shall provide Parent and its
Representatives with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of
any material oral comments, that the Company or its Representatives receive
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after
the receipt of such comments and shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity
under the circumstances to review and comment on any proposed written or
material oral responses to such comments. Unless a Company Board
Recommendation Change shall have occurred, the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to permit Parent and Merger Sub or their Representatives to
participate with the Company and its Representatives in any discussions or
meetings with the SEC.

 



 

(b) In connection with the Offer, if requested by Merger Sub, the Company
shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to Merger Sub mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Company Common
Stock, a non-objecting beneficial owners list and security position listings
of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, each as of the most recent
practicable date, and shall promptly furnish to Merger Sub such additional
information, including updated lists of Stockholders, mailing labels, security
position listings and computer files, and such other information and
assistance as Merger Sub or its agents may reasonably request for the purpose
of communicating the Offer to the Stockholders. Subject to the requirements of
applicable Law and the Confidentiality Agreement, and except for such steps as
are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub and their agents shall
hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and
files, will use such

 



      
 

 



 

information only in connection with such transactions and, if this Agreement
shall be terminated, Parent and Merger Sub will, upon request by the Company,
deliver to the Company or destroy, and will use their reasonable best efforts
to cause their Representatives to deliver to the Company or destroy, all
copies of such information then in their possession or control.

 



 

(c) Unless the Company shall have effected a Company Board Recommendation
Change, Parent shall advise the Company as to the aggregate number of shares
of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer at least on: (i) a weekly basis,
from the commencement of the Offer until the tenth (10th) business day prior
to the initial expiration of the Offer and (ii) a daily basis, on each of the
last ten (10) business days prior to the initial expiration of the Offer and
on each business day thereafter until the Expiration Date and in any
"subsequent offering period".

 



 

1.3 _Directors_.

 



 

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable Law, promptly after the initial
acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of the Tendered Shares pursuant to the
Offer (the " **Acceptance Time** "), subject to Parent or Merger Sub
depositing the payment for the Tendered Shares with the depositary agent for
the Offer, and from time to time thereafter (but only for so long as Parent
and Merger Sub beneficially own at least a majority of the outstanding
Shares), Merger Sub shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board as is
equal to the product of the total number of directors on the Company Board
(giving effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to the next
sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares
beneficially owned by Parent and Merger Sub at such time (including Shares so
accepted for payment and, if the Top-Up Option is exercised, the Shares
purchased upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option) represents as a fraction of
the total number of Shares then outstanding on a fully diluted basis. As used
in this Agreement, the terms " **beneficial ownership** " **** (and its
correlative terms) shall have the meanings provided in Rule 13d-3 under the
Exchange Act. In furtherance thereof and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law and the rules of the NYSE, promptly after the Acceptance Time,
the Company shall, upon request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to
cause Merger Subs designees to be so elected or appointed, including
increasing the size of the Company Board (by amending the Company Bylaws (as
defined herein) if necessary) and/or seeking the resignations of one or more
incumbent directors as appropriate.

 



 

(b) From time to time after the Acceptance Time, subject to Parent depositing
the payment for the Tendered Shares with the depositary agent for the Offer
and subject to _Section 1.3(c)_, the Company shall take all action necessary
to cause the individuals so designated by Merger Sub to constitute
substantially the same percentage (rounding up where appropriate) as is on the
Board of Directors of the Company of each committee of the Board of Directors
of the Company.

 



 

(c) The Companys obligations under _Sections 1.3(a)_ and _(b)_ shall be
subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder, and the Company shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such
information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable
Merger Subs designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board. Merger
Sub shall promptly after the date hereof (and in any event, a reasonable time

 



      
 

 



 

prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9) furnish to the Company, and be
solely responsible for, information with respect to Merger Subs designees and
Parents and Merger Subs respective officers, directors and affiliates to the
extent such information is required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 or as
otherwise provided to the Company by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the
Schedule 14D-9.

 



 

(d) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to this _Section 1.3_ then, until the Effective Time,
the Company and Parent shall (i) allow the Company Board to maintain at least
three (3) directors who are members of the Company Board on the date of this
Agreement and who are independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the
Exchange Act (the " **Independent Directors** "), (ii) allow the Independent
Directors who are members of the audit committee of the Company Board
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement to remain as the sole members
of the audit committee of the Company Board and (iii) cause such audit
committee to comply with all requirements of Federal Securities Laws and the
NYSE applicable thereto. If any Independent Director is unable to serve due to
death, disability or resignation, then the remaining Independent Directors
(or, if no Independent Director is then in office, the members of the Company
Board) shall be entitled to elect or appoint another individual to fill each
such vacancy, which individual shall not be an officer, director, employee or
agent of, or otherwise an Affiliate of, Parent or Merger Sub and shall
otherwise satisfy all requirements of Federal Securities Laws and the NYSE
applicable to a member of an audit committee, and each such individual shall
be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement; it
being further understood and agreed that if any Independent Director that is
so unable to serve was a member of the audit committee of the Company Board,
the Independent Director appointed to fill such vacancy shall serve as a
member of the audit committee. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, from and after the time, if any, that Merger Subs designees
pursuant to this _Section 1.3_ constitute a majority of the Company Board and
prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of the
Independent Directors, acting _qua_ audit committee of the Company Board,
shall be required and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, be
sufficient to (A) amend, modify or terminate this Agreement on behalf of the
Company or to amend or modify the terms or conditions of the Offer or the
Merger or any of the agreements contemplated or referenced hereby, (B)
exercise or waive any of the Companys rights or remedies under this Agreement
or any of the agreements contemplated or referenced hereby, (C) extend the
time for performance of Parents or Merger Subs obligations under this
Agreement or any of the agreements contemplated or referenced hereby, (D)
enforce any obligation of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement or any of
the agreements contemplated or referenced hereby, or (E) amend or otherwise
modify in any manner adverse to the Stockholders the Company Certificate of
Incorporation or Company Bylaws. The Independent Directors, acting _qua_ audit
committee of the Company Board, shall have the authority to retain counsel
(which may include current counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the
expense of the Company as determined appropriate by the Independent Directors
and shall have the authority, after the Acceptance Time and prior to the
Effective Time, to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce
the performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall, upon Parents request, take all actions reasonably necessary to elect
to be treated as a "controlled company" (within the meaning of the listing
requirements of the NYSE); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
sentence shall limit or modify in any way the other provisions of this
_Section 1.3(d)_.

 



      
 

 



 

1.4 _Top-Up Option_.

 



 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "
**Top-Up Option** "), exercisable upon the terms and conditions of this
_Section 1.4_, to purchase from the Company a number of newly-issued Shares
(the " **Top-Up Shares** ") equal to at least the number of Shares that, when
added to the number of Shares owned directly or indirectly by Parent and
Merger Sub at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one (1) Share more
than the number of Shares necessary for Merger Sub to be merged with and into
the Company pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL (after giving effect to the
issuance of Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Top-Up Option).

 



 

(b) The Top-Up Option shall only be exercisable once, in whole and not in
part, at any time at or after the later of the Acceptance Time (subject to
Parent or Merger Sub depositing the payment for the Tendered Shares with the
depositary agent for the Offer) and the date of expiration of any "subsequent
offering period" and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up
Option shall not be exercisable and shall terminate (x) at the later of the
Acceptance Time and the date of expiration of any "subsequent offering period"
if the minimum number of Top-Up Shares issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option would exceed the number of authorized but unissued and unreserved
Shares (including as authorized and unissued Shares, for purposes of this
_Section 1.4_, any Shares held in the treasury of the Company), (y) if any
judgment, injunction, order or decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-
Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Shares or (z) upon the termination of
the Agreement in accordance with its terms. Subject to _Section 1.4(d)_, the
aggregate amount payable to the Company for the Top-Up Shares shall be equal
to the product of the number of Top-Up Shares and the Offer Price (the "
**Top-Up Consideration** ").

 



 

(c) If there shall have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the
Offer that number of Shares which, when added to the Shares owned directly or
indirectly by Parent or Merger Sub and the maximum number of Top-Up Shares
that may be issued in accordance with this _Section 1.4_ would represent the
number of Shares necessary for Merger Sub to be merged with and into the
Company pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL, then promptly following the
Acceptance Time or expiration of any "subsequent offering period" (and, in any
event, by the earlier of (x) the second (2nd) Business Day thereafter and (y)
the Outside Date then in effect), Merger Sub shall exercise the Top-Up Option
and shall give the Company the written notice contemplated by _Section
1.4(e)_.

 



 

(d) The Top-Up Consideration shall consist of (i) an amount equal to the par
value of the Top-Up Shares, to be paid in cash, and (ii) an amount equal to
the balance of the Top-Up Consideration, which may be paid in the sole
discretion of Parent and Merger Sub (x) in cash or (y) by issuance by Merger
Sub ( _provided_ that if Merger Sub is not the holder of the Tendered Shares,
then by issuance by Parent) of an unsecured, non-negotiable, non-transferable
promissory note (which shall be treated as payment to the extent of the
principal amount thereof), or any combination of the foregoing. Any such
promissory note shall (A) accrue simple interest at the rate per annum of
5.0%, (B) shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and
delivery of such promissory note, (C) may be prepaid at any time and from time
to time, without premium or penalty, (D) shall provide that the unpaid
principal amount and accrued

 



      
 

 



 

interest under the promissory note shall immediately become due and payable in
the event that (1) Merger Sub fails to timely make any payment on the
promissory note as provided therein and such failure continues for a period of
thirty (30) days or (2) Merger Sub files or has filed against it any petition
under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or makes a general assignment for the
benefit of creditors, and (E) shall have no other material terms. The Company
Board has determined that the Top-Up Consideration is adequate in accordance
with the DGCL and otherwise taken all steps necessary such that upon issuance
and delivery in accordance with this _Section 1.4_ the Top-Up Option Shares
shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

 



 

(e) In the event Merger Sub wishes (or is required) to exercise the Top-Up
Option, Merger Sub shall give the Company written notice, and shall set forth
in such notice (i) the number of Shares that will be owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent and Merger Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the
Top-Up Shares, (ii) the place and time for the closing of the purchase of the
Top-Up Shares, and (iii) the manner in which Merger Sub intends to pay the
applicable exercise price; _provided_ , _however_ , that Merger Sub shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the Top-Up Option to occur on
the same date and at the same place as the Closing and in any event no later
than the earlier of (x) five (5) Business Days after delivery of such notice
and (y) the Outside Date then in effect. If the closing of the Top-Up Option
is not to be on the same date of the Closing, then such notice shall also
include an undertaking signed by Parent and Merger Sub that Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, as promptly as practicable after such
exercise of the Top-Up Option and the delivery by the Company of the Top-Up
Shares (but in any event no later than the Outside Date then in effect),
consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms hereof. The Company shall,
promptly following receipt of such notice, deliver written notice to Parent
and Merger Sub certifying the number of Shares then outstanding and specifying
the number of Top-Up Shares to be issued and the Top-Up Consideration due in
exchange therefor, calculated in accordance with _Section 1.4(b)_; _provided_
, _however_ , that in no event shall the Company be required to issue any Top-
Up Shares if the number of Shares that, when added to the number of Shares
owned directly or indirectly by Parent and Merger Sub at the time of such
exercise, constitutes one (1) Share more than the number of Shares necessary
for Merger Sub to be merged with and into the Company pursuant to Section 253
of the DGCL (after giving effect to the issuance of such Shares) exceeds the
number of authorized but unissued and unreserved Shares (including as
authorized and unissued Shares, for purposes of this _Section 1.4_, any
Shares held in the treasury of the Company). At the closing of the purchase of
the Top-Up Shares, Parent or Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the
Company the Top-Up Consideration, and the Company shall cause to be issued to
Parent or Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares issued to
Merger Sub as of the closing of the Top-Up Option.

 



 

(f) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares that Merger Sub
may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under
the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an applicable
exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Merger Sub will
be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor", as
defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub
agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for
the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and for so long as
this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_, the
Company agrees that it shall maintain out of its existing authorized capital,
free from preemptive rights, 110,000,000 authorized but unissued shares of
Company Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement (and, for purposes of
this _Section 1.4_, such shares of Company Common Stock shall not be deemed
reserved for issuance).

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees and acknowledges that in any appraisal proceeding under Section 262 of
the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares, the Surviving Company (as
defined in _Section 2.1_ below) shall not assert that the Top-Up Option, the
Top-Up Option Shares or any cash or the promissory note delivered to the
Company in payment for such Top-Up Option Shares should be considered in
connection with the determination of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



 

1.5 _Notices of Guaranteed Delivery_. For purposes of this Agreement,
including _Annex I_ , the exercise of the Top-Up and the Offer, unless
otherwise mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent, any shares of Company
Common Stock subject to notices of guaranteed delivery shall be deemed not to
be validly tendered into the Offer unless and until the shares of Company
Common Stock underlying such notices of guaranteed delivery are delivered to
or on behalf of Merger Sub.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II**

 



 

 ** _THE MERGER_**

 



 

2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged

shall continue as the surviving company in the Merger (the " **Surviving
Company** ").

 



 

2.2 _Closing of the Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " **Closing** ") will
take place no later than the second (2nd) Business Day after satisfaction or

_Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions) at 10:00 a.m., eastern time, at
the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022,

applicable, relating to the Merger (in either case, the " **Certificate of
Merger** ") in such form as is required by, and executed in accordance with,
the

 



      
 

 



 

relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time
when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the parties
hereto in writing in accordance with the DGCL and specified in the Certificate
of Merger (the " **Effective Time** "). Notwithstanding the terms of _Section
2.8_, if following the Acceptance Time and the expiration of any "subsequent
offering period" made in accordance with this Agreement, if applicable, and
the exercise of the Top-Up Option, if applicable, the number of Shares
beneficially owned by Parent, Merger Sub and their respective subsidiaries
collectively represents at least the number of Shares necessary for Merger Sub
to be merged into the Company pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL, then the
parties shall take such necessary and appropriate actions in order to cause
the Merger to be completed as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL and otherwise as provided in this
_Article II_ without convening a Stockholders Meeting (as defined in _Section
2.8_).

successors are duly elected or appointed (as the case may be) and qualified,
or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 



 

2.7 _Officers_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that

of Merger Sub or the Company, the directors and authorized officers of the
Surviving Company are fully authorized in the name of Merger Sub or the
Company, as the case may be, to take, and shall take, any and all such lawful
action.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 ** _CONSIDERATION_**

 



 

3.1 _Effect of the Merger on Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company and
such shares shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Surviving Company. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Company
into which they were converted in accordance with the preceding sentence.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock, Parent-Owned Stock and Merger Sub-Owned
Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub) or held by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries as treasury shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares to be canceled in
accordance with _Section 3.1(b)_ and any Dissenting Shares) shall thereupon
be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price, without interest and
less any Taxes required to be withheld as described in _Section 3.5_ (the "
**Merger Consideration** "). At the Effective Time, all such Shares shall
cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each Certificate or Book-Entry Share which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Shares shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
therefor.

 



 

3.2 _Exchange and Payment_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the
" **Paying Agent** ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Company to
deposit, in trust for the benefit of holders of Shares and pursuant to a
paying agent agreement in customary form, an amount of cash in immediately
available dollar-denominated funds in an aggregate amount sufficient for the
Paying Agent to deliver to holders of Shares the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1_. Any cash
deposited with the Paying Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
**Exchange Fund** ". The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than to fund payments due pursuant to _Section 3.1_, except as provided in
this Agreement. Parent shall pay the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.

 



 

(b) _Exchanging Procedures_.

 



 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in no
event more than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record (other than holders of Dissenting Shares) of an outstanding certificate
or outstanding certificates (" **Certificates** ") and to each holder of
uncertificated Shares represented by book entry (" **Book-Entry Shares** ")
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares
that were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration with
respect thereto pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_, (A) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates held by such Person shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent), which letter shall
be in customary form and contain such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably agree, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 3.2(g)_) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable with respect thereto pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_. Upon
surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal (or, in the case of a Book-Entry Share, upon delivery of such
letter of transmittal or upon the entry through a book-entry transfer agent of
the surrender of such Book-Entry Shares on a book-entry account statement),
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require
(a " **Proper Delivery** "), the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share (other than

 



      
 

 



 

holders of Dissenting Shares) shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section 3.1_ in respect of the Shares represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
Merger Consideration payable in respect of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.
Payment of Merger Consideration shall be made as promptly as practicable after
the date of Proper Delivery of the applicable Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

 



 

(ii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered
in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be exchanged
upon compliance with the procedures described above may be issued to such
transferee if the letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed,
and the Certificate formerly representing such Shares are presented to the
Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that all applicable transfer Taxes and other
similar Taxes required to be paid in connection with such transfer of
ownership of Shares have been paid or are not applicable.

 



 

(iii) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2(b)_, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share, as applicable, pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)_, without any
interest thereon.

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All cash paid upon
the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the
terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the close
of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company
of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is
presented to the Surviving Company for transfer, it shall be canceled against
delivery of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this _Article III_.

 



 

(d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying
Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Company for, and Parent shall
remain liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Company, or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance with
any applicable state, federal or other abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered
prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger

 



      
 

 



 

Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
invest the cash in the Exchange Fund in short term obligations of, or short
term obligations guaranteed by, the full faith and credit of the United States
of America. Nothing contained herein and no investment losses resulting from
investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any Stockholder
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein. To the extent there
are losses with respect to such investments or the Exchange Fund diminishes
for any other reason below the level required to make prompt cash payment of
the aggregate funds required to be paid pursuant to _Section 3.1_, Parent
shall promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to
ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient
to make such cash payments. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess
of the amounts payable under _Section 3.1_ shall be promptly paid to Parent.

 



 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond or surety in a customary amount as Parent
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration
with respect thereto, without any interest thereon.

 



 

3.3 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time (or, if the Acceptance Time
occurs on or prior to December 31, 2012 and the Effective Time would occur
after December 31, 2012, then no later than December 31, 2012), each Company
Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised, whether or not vested, shall
be canceled in exchange for the right to receive a lump sum cash payment equal
to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over
(B) the exercise price per Share for such Company Stock Option and (ii) the
total number of shares underlying such Company Stock Option, less applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. If the exercise
price per Share for any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration such Company Stock Option shall be canceled without
payment of consideration.

 



 

(b) _Company Restricted Stock_. Each holder of an unvested award of Company
Restricted Stock shall have the right to tender such Company Restricted Stock
into the Offer. Effective upon the Acceptance Time, each share of Company
Restricted Stock shall become fully vested, and the restrictions thereon shall
lapse. The Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 3.3(b)_ under the Company Stock Plan and any
other plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all notices and
making any determinations and/or resolutions of the Company Board or a
committee thereof.

 



 

(c) _Payment_. All payments under this _Section 3.3_ with respect to each
Company Stock Option and share of Company Restricted Stock shall be made,
without interest,

 



      
 

 



 

by the Surviving Company within five (5) Business Days following the Effective
Time (and in any event, if the Acceptance Time occurs on or prior to December
31, 2012 and the Effective Time would occur after December 31, 2012, then no
later than December 31, 2012).

 



 

(d) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company, the
Company Board and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are reasonably necessary to effectuate
the provisions of this _Section 3.3_. Parent agrees to take any actions that
are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section 3.3_.

 



 

3.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
stock dividend, distribution or division, recapitalization, merger, issuer
tender offer or issuer exchange offer or other similar transaction, the Offer
Price and the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately and proportionately
adjusted; provided, that nothing in this _Section 3.4 _shall be construed to
permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

3.5 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Company, Merger Sub and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person hereunder such amounts as Parent, the
Surviving Company, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " **Code** "), or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by Parent, the Surviving
Company, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by Parent, the Surviving Company, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent.

 



 

3.6 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time held by a holder who is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such Shares (" **Dissenting Shares** "),
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL
(the " **Appraisal Rights** "), shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, but instead shall be converted into the
right to receive such consideration as may be due such holder pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses such holders right to such payment or appraisal. For purposes
of determining the aggregate amount to be deposited with the Paying Agent,
Parent shall assume that no Stockholder shall have perfected any right to
appraisal of his, her or its Shares. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Dissenting Shares, except the right to receive
the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses any such Appraisal Rights or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, each such share of such holder
shall no longer be

 



      
 

 



 

considered a Dissenting Share and shall be deemed to have converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 3.1(c)_, without any interest thereon. The Company
shall give prompt written notice to Parent of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock or written threats
thereof, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant
to applicable Law received by the Company relating to Stockholders rights of
appraisal, and Parent shall have the right to participate and, following the
Acceptance Time, to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands or approve any withdrawal
of any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section or in any other section
to the extent they are forward-looking statements or cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature) (a " **Filed SEC Document** ") (it being understood
that any information set forth in any Filed SEC Document shall qualify a
specific representation or warranty contained in this _Section 4.1_ only to
the extent that it is reasonably apparent that such information would be

duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of the State of Delaware.
Each Subsidiary of the Company is duly organized and validly existing under
the Laws of its jurisdiction of organization, except where the failure to be
so organized or existing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate power and
authority to carry on its business as presently conducted, except where the
failure to have such power or authority, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has

 



      
 

 



 

not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has publicly filed with the SEC or made available

and are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned, directly or indirectly, by
the Company free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges, mortgages,
encumbrances or security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever
(collectively, " **Liens** ") other than (i) Liens imposed under any federal
or state securities Laws or (ii) under the Credit Agreement. Except as set
forth in _Section 4.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no
arrangements relating to the issuance, acquisition, redemption, repurchase or
sale of any equity security or other ownership interests of any Subsidiary of
the Company, including any right of conversion or exchange under any

does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or voting
securities or equity interests in, any Person.

authority and has taken all corporate action necessary to execute and deliver
this Agreement, perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the
Merger, subject, in the case of the Merger, to receipt of the Stockholder
Approval (if required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by each of the other parties hereto, constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company

 _Section 4.2(f)_, the Company Board has taken all actions necessary so that
Section 203 of the DGCL does not, and will not, apply to (i) Parent, Merger
Sub or any other Affiliate of Parent with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or (ii) the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Support Agreements,
and to ensure that Section 203 of the DGCL will not impose any additional

or Merger Sub, following the Acceptance Time and subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement, to vote or otherwise exercise all rights as a

Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) _Noncontravention; Governmental Filings_.

 



 

(i) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not, and
the consummation of the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, conflict with, result in
any breach or violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, give rise to a right of termination, cancellation or

material information concerning the Company (including its Subsidiaries)
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or

mailed to Stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. Each document required to be filed by the
Company with the SEC or distributed or otherwise disseminated by the Company
to its stockholders in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
will comply (when filed, distributed or disseminated, respectively) as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding anything else
herein to the contrary, no representation or warranty is made by the Company
with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on

event occurred after the date of this Agreement, and (b) there has not been
any event, change, state of facts, condition or occurrence that, individually

against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the
executive officers of the Company, any current director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in their capacity as such), other than

(ii) Except as set forth on _Section 4.1(p)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, or as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole:

 



 

(A) Either the Company or one of its Subsidiaries owns or has the right to use
each item of Intellectual Property Rights as used in their business as
currently conducted, free and clear of all Liens (other than Company Permitted
Liens); _provided_ , _that_ , __ the foregoing representation and warranty
does not cover infringement, misappropriation or other violation of
Intellectual Property Rights, which is addressed solely in _Section
4.1(p)(ii)(B)_ and _(D)_ , except to the extent that such infringement,
misappropriation or other violation is of Intellectual Property Rights that
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (i) purports to own but does not own,
or (ii) purports to use under license but is not so licensed.

 



 

(B) The conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as

the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party, (ii) demanding or
offering that the Company license of any Intellectual Property Rights from a
third party, where the demand or offer was unsolicited and is reasonably
interpreted to be an assertion of such Intellectual Property Rights or a
suggestion that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries was infringing the
same; or (iii) challenging or threatening to challenge the ownership, use,
validity, enforceability or infringement of any Intellectual Property Rights
owned by the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is or in
the past three (3) years has been a party to any Proceeding in which it was
asserted that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries infringed,
misappropriated or otherwise violated the Intellectual Property Rights of any
third party.

to protect and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of Trade Secrets.

Subsidiaries to use or exploit the same or obligate the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to (i) disclose or distribute in source code form any portion
thereof, (ii) license or offer on a royalty-free basis any portion thereof, or

Property Rights licensed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(G) Since December 31, 2011 (i) the Company IT Assets have not malfunctioned
or failed and (ii) there has been no unauthorized or improper access to any of
the Company IT Assets, in each case, except as has not had and would not

forth in _Section 4.2(f)_, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote thereon at a Stockholders Meeting

(ii) The Company Financial Advisor has delivered to the Company Board its
written opinion (or an oral opinion to be confirmed in writing), dated as of

Common Stock in the Offer and the Merger is fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than Parent or any
Affiliate of Parent).

breach or default, or permit termination or material modification of any such

disclosed in the disclosure letter delivered by Parent to the Company on or
prior to the date of this Agreement (the " **Parent Disclosure Letter** ") (it
being understood that any information set forth in one section or subsection

or subsection of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent
that such information is relevant to such other section or subsection), Parent
and Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company as
follows:

 



 

(a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of its jurisdiction
of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority
to carry on its business as presently conducted, except where the failure to
be so organized or existing or to have such power or authority, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and, with respect to jurisdictions in
which such concept is recognized, is in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) _Capitalization of Merger Sub; Operations of Merger Sub_. The authorized
share capital of Merger Sub consists of 100 shares of common stock, $0.01 par
value per share, 50 of which have been validly issued and are outstanding. All

interests of Parent (as its sole stockholder), upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein and authorizing the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Merger Sub, the performance by Merger Sub of its obligations
hereunder and the consummation by Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Subject to the adoption of this Agreement by Parent (as the

 



      
 

 



 

sole stockholder of Merger Sub), which shall occur promptly following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, no other corporate proceedings on
the part of Parent or Merger Sub (including any vote of holders of capital
stock of Parent) are necessary to authorize or approve Parents and Merger
Subs execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by Parent
and Merger Sub of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate
power and authority and has taken all corporate (or limited liability company,

subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the other parties hereto,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms,
subject, as to enforceability, to the Enforceability Exceptions.

the properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub under, any provision of (A)
the organizational documents of Parent or Merger Sub or (B) any Contract to

Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 shall, at the respective times filed
with the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it is

Subsidiaries, to the extent the determination to acquire such shares was not
directed by Parent or Merger Sub).

or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford to any Person (other than Parent, Merger

Acquisition Proposal, or (v) enter into any Contract contemplating or
otherwise relating to an Acquisition Transaction (other than an Acceptable

or elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company, the
Companys Subsidiaries, the Companys Representatives and the Companys
Subsidiaries Representatives may, subject to compliance with this _Section _
_5.2(c)_ , (i) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with any
Person or group of Persons that has made a _bona fide_ , unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that the Company Board
(or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, either constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and/or (ii) furnish to
any Person or group of Persons that has made a _bona fide_ , unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that the Company Board
(or any committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, either constitutes or would

information relating to the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries and/or
afford to any such Person or group of Persons access to the business,
properties, assets, books, records or other non public information, or to any
personnel, of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case under
this clause (ii) pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any action taken pursuant to the
preceding _clauses (i)_ or _(ii)_ , (A) the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor

 



       
 

 



 

and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties to the Stockholders under applicable Law, (B) the Company shall as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within forty-eight (48)
hours following receipt of such Acquisition Proposal) give Parent written
notice of the identity of such Person or group of Persons (unless prohibited
by the Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) and, if applicable, providing
Parent with copies of the Acquisition Proposal and any draft agreements
relating to the Acquisition Proposal (or, if written copies are unavailable, a
summary of the material terms thereof), and (C) promptly after furnishing any
non public information or giving access to such Person or group of Persons,
the Company shall give such access and furnish such non public information to
Parent (which may be by posting such information to a "virtual data room"
available to Parent and its Representatives) to the extent such access or
information has not been previously furnished to Parent.

 



 

(d) If the Company becomes aware of any receipt by the Company of (i) any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information that would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) any inquiry with
respect to, or which would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, the Company shall reasonably promptly (and in any event, within
forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent of the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or
group of Persons (unless prohibited by an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. The

status or terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt or delivery thereof).

 



 

(e) The Company agrees that in the event any of its Subsidiaries or
Representatives takes any action which, if taken by the Company, would
constitute a breach of this _Section 5.2_, the Company shall be deemed to be
in breach of this _Section 5.2_; _provided_ , _however_ , that any breach of
a Support Agreement by any counterparty thereto (in such Persons capacity as
a stockholder of the Company) shall not constitute a breach by a
Representative or a deemed breach by the Company hereunder.

 



 

5.3 _Company Board Recommendation_.

 



 

(a) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold,
withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Sub, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii)
if a tender offer or exchange offer for Company Common Stock that constitutes
an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) is commenced by a
Person unaffiliated with Parent, fail to file a Schedule 14D-9 pursuant to
Rule 14e-2 and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act recommending that
the Stockholders reject such Acquisition Proposal and not tender any shares of
Company Common Stock into such tender or exchange offer (including, for these
purposes, by taking no position with respect to the acceptance of such tender
offer or exchange offer by the Stockholders) (it being understood that the
Company Board may refrain from taking any position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the tenth (10th) Business
Day after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-2
under the

 



      
 

 



 

Exchange Act, including issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act), (iii) fail to publicly
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) Business Days after
Parent so reasonably requests in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
shall only be permitted to make two (2) such requests in any given twenty (20)
Business Day period; (iv) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or publicly
propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal
made or received after the date hereof, (v) cause or permit the Company to
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement
constituting or relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement as permitted under _Section 5.2(c)_) or (vi) fail
to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 and, if
applicable, the Proxy Statement (any of the actions described in clauses (i)
through (vi) of this _Section _ _5.3(a)_ , a " **Company Board Recommendation
Change** "). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
Board (or any committee thereof) may, in response to (x) an Intervening Event
or (y) receipt of a _bona fide_ , unsolicited Acquisition Proposal not arising
from any breach (other than an inadvertent breach) of _Section 5.2_ after the
date of this Agreement that the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, either constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal, in each case, effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change pursuant to clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (vi) of such
definition if (i) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Stockholders under applicable
Law; (ii) the Company has provided at least twenty-four (24) hours prior
written notice to Parent that it intends to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change, describing in reasonable detail the reasons for such
Company Board Recommendation Change (a " **Recommendation Change Notice** "),
including a description of the Intervening Event in reasonable detail (in the
case of an Intervening Event) or the information described in _Section
5.2(d)_ (in the case of a Superior Proposal) (it being agreed that the
Recommendation Change Notice and any amendment or update to such notice and
the determination to so deliver such notice, or update or amend public
disclosures with respect thereto shall not constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement); (iii) if requested by
Parent after receipt of such notice, the Company shall have made its
Representatives available to discuss with Parents Representatives and
negotiate in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) any
proposed modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during
the period beginning at 5:00 p.m. New York City Time on the day of delivery by
the Company to Parent of such Recommendation Change Notice and ending five (5)
Business Days later at 5:00 p.m. New York City Time; _provided_ , _however_
that in the event there is a material change to the facts and circumstances
relating to the Intervening Event (in the case of an Intervening Event) or
material revisions to the terms or conditions of the Superior Proposal (in the
case of a Superior Proposal), the Company shall be required to deliver a new
Recommendation Change Notice to Parent and to comply again with the
requirements of this _Section 5.3_, except that references to the five (5)
Business Day period in this clause (iii) shall be deemed references to a
forty-eight (48) hour period; and (iv) the Company Board (or any committee
thereof) shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel), after considering in good faith the terms of any proposed
amendment or modification

 



      
 

 



 

to this Agreement, that the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change would still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Stockholders under applicable Law.

 



 

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company or the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) from, without limiting the generality
of _Section 5.3(a)_, (i) taking and disclosing to the Stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the
provisions of Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) issuing a
"stop look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder
as contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI**

 



 

 ** _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_**

 



 

6.1 _Access and Reports_.

 



 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents officers and other authorized
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the
period prior to the Effective Time, to its employees, properties, books,
Contracts and records, and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to Parent or its officers or
authorized Representatives all information (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, Tax information) concerning its business, properties and personnel as
may reasonably be requested. All requests for information made pursuant to
this _Section 6.1_ shall be directed to the chief executive officer or other
persons designated by the chief executive officer of the Company. All such
information shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
No investigation pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ or by Parent or its
Representatives at any time prior to or following the date hereof shall affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the Company
herein. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
none of Parent or its Representatives shall have any right to perform or
conduct, or cause to be performed or conducted, any environmental sampling or
testing at, in, on or underneath any of the Companys properties.

 



 

(b) This _Section 6.1_ shall not require the Company or its Subsidiaries to
permit any access to, or to disclose (i) any information that, in the
reasonable, good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be
in-house counsel) of the Company, is reasonably likely to (x) result in any
violation of any Law or any Contract to which the Company or its Subsidiaries
is a party, (y) have an adverse impact on any trade secret, or (z) undermine
the work product privilege or attorney-client privilege, as applicable, that
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert, (ii) if
the Company or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent or any of
its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation, any
information that is reasonably pertinent thereto or (iii) any pricing or other
matters that are highly sensitive or competitive in nature if disclosure
thereof could reasonably likely be harmful to the Company or its Subsidiaries
in any material respect; _provided_ , that, in the case of clause (i) or
(iii), the parties hereto shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow
disclosure of such information to the extent doing so (A) would not (in the
good faith belief of the Company (after

 



      
 

 



 

consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be reasonably
likely to result in the violation of any such Law or Contract or be reasonably
likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to such
information or be competitively harmful or (B) could reasonably (in the good
faith belief of the Company (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-
house counsel)) be managed through the use of customary "clean-room"
arrangements pursuant to which non-employee Representatives of Parent could be
provided access to such information.

 



 

6.2 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best
efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to
cause the Offer Conditions and conditions in _Article VII_ to be satisfied as
promptly as reasonably practicable, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental
Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Authorities) and the taking of all steps
as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid a
Proceeding by, any Governmental Authority and (iii) the execution and delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In
connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall (x) as promptly as reasonably practicable, but in no event later
than five (5) Business Days after the date hereof, duly file with the United
States Federal Trade Commission (the " **FTC** ") and the Antitrust Division
of the Department of Justice (the " **Antitrust Division** ") the notification
and report form required under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (y) as promptly as reasonably practicable,
duly file with the FSA all notification forms and supporting documents and
information as required under the FSMA and as required or requested by the FSA
in respect of the change of controllers of UK Sub in connection with the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
(i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any Proceeding initiated by a private party, in each case, regarding
the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) keep the other party informed of
any material communication received by such party from, or given by such party
to, the FTC, the Antitrust Division, the FSA or any other Governmental
Authority and of any communication received or given in connection with any
Proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding the transaction and
(iii) subject to applicable Law, permit the other party to review, in advance,
any written communication given by it to or received from, and consult with
each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, the FTC, the
Antitrust Division, the FSA or any other Governmental Authority or, in
connection with any Proceeding by a private party regarding the transaction,
any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the Antitrust
Division, the FSA or other applicable Governmental Authority or other Person,
give the

 



      
 

 



 

other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
conferences subject to applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) respond as promptly as
practicable under the circumstances to any inquiries received from the FTC,
the Antitrust Division, the FSA or any other Governmental Authority for
additional information or documentation and to all inquiries and requests
received from such Governmental Authorities, (ii) not extend any waiting
period (or withdraw and re-file the filing) under the HSR Act or the FSMA
without the prior written consent of the other party and (iii) not enter into
any agreement with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the other party. Subject to _Section 6.2(d)_, Parent and the Company
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their respective
reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have lifted, vacated or
terminated, any injunction or Judgment that would restrain, prevent or delay
the consummation of the Offer or the Closing.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
parties hereby agree and acknowledge that neither this _Section 6.2_ nor the
"reasonable best efforts" standard shall require, or be construed to require
Parent or any of its Affiliates or permit the Company or any of its
Affiliates, in order to obtain any required approval from any Governmental
Authority or any third party, to sell, license, divest or dispose of or hold
separate, before or after the Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, any
entities, assets, Intellectual Property Rights or businesses of Parent, the
Company or the Surviving Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
other Affiliates).

 



 

6.3 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period of not less than twelve (12) months following the Effective
Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, provide (i) total
compensation (without any reduction to base salary) to each Person who is an
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time and who continues as an employee of the Surviving Company or
one of its Affiliates (each, a " **Continuing Employee** ") that is no less
favorable in the aggregate than that in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) severance benefits to each Continuing Employee that are
substantially similar to those available to similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries taking into account such Continuing Employees
service with the Company and (iii) employee benefit plans and arrangements
(other than, base salary and bonus opportunities and any equity-based plans)
to each Continuing Employee that are either (A) substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those provided to each Continuing Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time or (B) the same as those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent (other than those benefits of Parent that are frozen or
discontinued as of the Closing Date). In addition to the foregoing, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, (I) pay to the Continuing
Employees the bonuses, including the change in control and retention bonuses,
described in _Section 5.1(b)(vii)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter in
accordance with the terms thereof, and (II) maintain until at least through
and including December 31, 2012 without any modification the commission pay
plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof and
pay all amounts earned by the Continuing Employees under such plans for 2012
to such Continuing Employees at the times

 



      
 

 



 

specified in such plans. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit the
right of Parent or the Surviving Company following the Effective Time to
terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time and for any or
no reason.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall give or cause to be given
to each Continuing Employee full credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting and determination of the level of benefit (but not for
purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) under any
benefit plans provided, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries covering Continuing Employees, for such Continuing Employees
service with the Surviving Company or any of its Affiliates (including
Parent), to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such employee participates, except to the extent
such credit would result in duplication of benefits.

 



 

(c) With respect to any welfare benefit plan of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate after
the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) use
commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods and
actively at work requirements with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees and their dependents and
beneficiaries under such plan to the extent waived or satisfied under the
applicable corresponding Company Benefit Plan and (ii) provide each Continuing
Employee and his or her eligible dependents and beneficiaries with credit
under such plan for any co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses paid
under corresponding Company Benefit Plans in the calendar year in which such
Continuing Employee (or his or her eligible dependents or beneficiaries)
become eligible to participate in such plan for purposes of satisfying any
applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, following the Acceptance Time, Parent shall
continue or cause to be continued in effect the short and long-term disability
insurance policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the
date hereof at least until the final determination regarding eligibility for
receipt of long-term disability insurance benefits thereunder of any employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who is receiving or entitled to
receive short-term or long-term disability benefits on the Closing has been
made.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing, the board of directors or other appropriate
governing body of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall adopt resolutions
stating that the Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified within the
meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (the " **Company 401(k) Plan**") is
terminated effective at least one day prior to the Closing Date, but with such
termination to be contingent on the occurrence of the Closing. The Company
shall provide Parent with a copy of such executed resolution. Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to the Continuing Employees immediately
following the Closing coverage under a 401(k) plan maintained by Parent or its
Affiliates (the " **Parent 401(k) Plan**"), and shall cause the Parent 401(k)
Plan to accept elective rollovers of "eligible rollover distributions" (as
defined in Section 402 of the Code) made to Continuing Employees from the
Company 401(k) Plan, including rollovers of distributions of promissory notes
evidencing participant loans. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall amend the
Parent 401(k) Plan and the Company shall amend the Company 401(k) Plan as may
be necessary to allow for rollovers of loans in kind out of the Company 401(k)
Plan and into the Parent 401(k) Plan and the Company and Parent shall
cooperate prior to the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

to establish a protocol for the loan rollover process. Following the Closing,
Parent shall cause the Company 401(k) Plan to distribute and the Parent 401(k)
Plan to accept the rollover to the Parent 401(k) Plan of promissory notes
evidencing participant loans under the Company 401(k) Plan in a manner that,
subject to the timely affirmative elections of the applicable Company 401(k)
Plan participant, does not cause the default of such loans.

 



 

6.4 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) All rights to indemnification against and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time (including any
matters arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), now existing in favor of the current or former directors or
officers of the Company as provided in the Company Certificate of
Incorporation, the Company Bylaws, any resolution adopted by the Company Board
or any indemnification agreement between such directors and officers and the
Company or its Subsidiaries in each case, as in effect immediately prior to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and, in the case of any such
resolution or indemnification agreement, as set forth on _Section 6.4(a)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, shall be assumed by the Surviving Company in
the Merger, without further action, as of the Effective Time, and shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms.

 



 

(b) The certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Company
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of individuals who were directors or
officers of the Company prior to the Effective Time than are presently set
forth in the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws,
which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

 



 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, in the event of any pending, threatened
or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (each, a "
**Claim** ") in which any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to
the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director or officer of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective predecessors (the " **Indemnified Parties** ") is, or is threatened
to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in
part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that prior to the Effective Time he
or she is or was a director or officer of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) acts or omissions prior to the
Effective Time by an Indemnified Party in the Indemnified Partys capacity as
director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or any of their
respective predecessors or taken at the request of the Company or such
Subsidiary or any of their respective predecessors, Parent and the Surviving
Company, jointly and severally, shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each such Indemnified Party
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, reasonable and documented
costs, reasonable and documented expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses, whether incurred in advance of or following the final disposition of
any Claim), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in
connection with any such threatened or actual Claim. Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Company shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any threatened or actual Claim for which

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification has been sought by an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise
or consent. Parent and the Surviving Company shall advance all documented
reasonable fees and expenses (including without limitation documented
reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel, experts, litigation
consultants, and the cost of any appeal bonds) incurred by an Indemnified
Party in connection with any Claim. The Indemnified Party shall qualify for
advances, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, so long as the
Indemnified Party undertakes to repay the advance to the extent that it is
ultimately determined that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to be
indemnified by the Company under the provisions of this Agreement, the
organizational documents of the Surviving Company, any indemnification
agreements set forth in _Section 6.4(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, or
applicable Law. Parents and the Surviving Companys obligations under this
_Section 6.4(c)_ shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six
(6) years from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted or made prior to the
Effective Time or within such six (6) year period shall continue until the
final disposition of such Claim.

 



 

(d) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _Section
6.4(c)_, upon learning of any such Claim, shall promptly notify Parent
thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the
Surviving Company of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party
except to the extent such failure prejudices the indemnifying party. In the
event of any such Claim, Parent or the Surviving Company shall have the right
to assume and control the defense thereof with counsel selected by Parent,
which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall be permitted to
participate in the defense of such Claim at its own expense, except that if
Parent or the Surviving Company elects not to assume such defense or there are
issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving
Company and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel satisfactory to them (and reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Surviving Company) (it being further understood and agreed that, in any such
case, to the extent that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest
among the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain more than
one counsel to the extent necessary to address such conflicts of interest),
and Parent or the Surviving Company shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel(s) for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor
are received. Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Company and the
Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the defense of any Claim and shall
provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and
furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. Notwithstanding
anything in this _Section 6.4_ to the contrary, unless Parent and the
Surviving Company elect not to assume such defense, Parent and the Surviving
Company shall not be liable for any settlement effected by any Indemnified
Party without their prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall have
any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party (and any Indemnified Party
to whom expenses are advanced agrees to repay such advances) if and when a
court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final and non-appealable, that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company may, in consultation with
Parent, obtain or pay for any "tail" insurance policies with a claims period
of at least six (6) years from and after the Acceptance Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " **D andO Insurance**") with
benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as the Companys
policies existing as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
"tail" insurance policies shall not require the payment of an aggregate annual
premium in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual
premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the date hereof to maintain
the DandO Insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if such "tail" insurance
policies cannot be obtained at all or can be obtained only for an amount in
excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the current annual premium therefor,
prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company may, in consultation with Parent,
obtain as much directors and officers liability insurance coverage as can be
obtained for an amount equal to three hundred percent (300%) of the current
annual premium therefor. If the Company and the Surviving Company shall for
any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Acceptance
Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Company to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six (6)
years from and after the Acceptance Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the
date hereof with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as that
provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or the
Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to
purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six (6)-year period with benefits
and levels of coverage at least as favorable as provided under the Companys
existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
Parent nor the Surviving Company shall be required to pay an aggregate annual
premium for such DandO Insurance or comparable DandO Insurance in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by
the Company prior to the date hereof to maintain the DandO Insurance.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.6_
hereof to the contrary, this _Section 6.4_ shall survive the consummation of

and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and their successors,
heirs or representatives, each of whom is an express third party beneficiary
of this _Section 6.4_. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Company or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving company or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and other assets to any Person, then, and
in each such case, Parent or the Surviving Company, as applicable, shall cause
proper provision to be made so that such successors and assigns shall
expressly assume (including by operation of Law) the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.4_. The obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this
_Section 6.4_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party to whom this _Section
6.4_ applies unless (i) such termination or modification is required by
applicable Law or (ii) the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented in
writing to such termination or modification.

 



 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 6.4_ are in addition to, and not in
substitution of, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have from the Company, Surviving Company or any other Person
by contract or otherwise.

public statements with respect to this Agreement and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of
the other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
except as may be required by Law or any listing agreement with the NYSE or any
stock exchange to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party. For the avoidance of

release or public announcement in connection with any action made in
compliance in all material respects with _Section 5.3_.

14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

 



 

6.9 _Stock Exchange De-Listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be

be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and shall otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effect of such

the lenders party thereto, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent

shall contribute all funds necessary for the Company to pay such outstanding
obligations. In the event that Parent contributes any funds to the Company
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall issue to
Parent in exchange for such contribution, a number of Shares equal to the (a)
the amount so contributed divided by (b) the Offer Price. To the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agrees and acknowledges that in any appraisal proceeding under Section 262 of
the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares, the Surviving Company shall
not assert that any amounts contributed to the Company or any Shares issued to

connection with the determination of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

(a) by mutual written agreement of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company;

 



 

(b) by either the Company or Parent in the event that the Offer Closing shall
not have occurred on or before October 8, 2012 (such date referred to herein

it may be extended as set forth below, the " **Outside Date** "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if, on the Initial Outside Date or any later Outside Date,
the condition set forth in clause (ii) of _Annex I_ shall not have been
satisfied but all other conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (except for the
Minimum Condition and the condition set forth in clause (viii) of _Annex I_ )
shall have been satisfied, then the Initial Outside Date or such later Outside

on December 21, 2012 all conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (except for the
Minimum Condition and the condition set forth in clause (viii) of _Annex I_ )
shall have been satisfied and (z) the Offer and the Merger are capable of
being consummated on or prior to December 31, 2012 (taking into account, among

_further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any Party hereto whose actions or
omissions have been a principal cause of, or primarily resulted in, the

or failure to act constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

payment for Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer illegal or
that prohibits the consummation of the Merger, or any Restraint enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the acceptance for payment of or payment for Company
Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer or the consummation of the Merger
and such Restraint shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of a Restraint, a Party shall not be permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ if the issuance of

Affiliate of such Party) to perform any covenant or other obligation under
this Agreement required to be performed by such Party (or any Affiliate of
such Party) at or prior to the Effective Time;

 



 

(d) by the Company, in the event that (i) the Company has complied in all
material respects with _Section 5.2_ and _Section 5.3_, (ii) the Company
shall have received a Superior Proposal; (iii) the Company Board (or any

agreement relating to such Superior Proposal would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Stockholders under applicable
Law; (iv) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a Recommendation Change
Notice; (v) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have made its
Representatives available to discuss with Parents Representatives and
negotiate in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) any

Business Day period shall be deemed references to a forty-eight (48) hour
period (it being understood and hereby agreed that such five (5) Business Day

Business Day or forty-eight (48) hour period contemplated by _Section
5.3(a)(iii)_); (vi) the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall

 



      
 

 



 

have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel),
after considering the terms of any proposed amendment or modification to this
Agreement, that the failure to enter into a definitive agreement relating to
such Superior Proposal would still reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the Stockholders under applicable Law; and (vii)
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into
such Superior Proposal and pays Parent the Termination Fee; _provided_ , that
the parties hereto agree that any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 8.1(d)_ shall not be effective until the Company shall have
paid the Termination Fee, but if Parent fails to deliver its wire instructions
within twenty-four (24) hours of a request for such instructions by the
Company, such termination shall be effective without regard to this proviso
(but subject, in any event, to payment of the Termination Fee within one (1)
Business Day following receipt of such wire instructions);

its representations, warranties or covenants under this Agreement in any
material respect and (ii) Parent or Merger Sub shall have breached any of its

prevent or materially impede, hinder or delay the consummation of the Offer or
the Merger), and shall have failed to cure such breach prior to the earlier of
(A) the Outside Date and (B) the thirtieth (30) Business Day after Parent has
received written notice of such breach from the Company (it being understood
that the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this _Section 8.1(g)(ii)_ in respect of the breach set forth in any such
written notice (x) at any time during such thirty (30) Business Day (or
shorter) period, and (y) at any time after such thirty (30) Business Day (or
shorter) period if Parent and Merger Sub shall have cured such breach during
such thirty (30) Business Day (or shorter) period); or

 



      
 

 



 

(h) by the Company, in the event that (i) Merger Sub fails to commence the
Offer within the time required by _Section 1.1(a)_ or terminates, withdraws
or makes any change to the Offer in violation of the terms of this Agreement
or (ii) at any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, Merger Sub fails to
accept for payment and pay for shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and not withdrawn in the Offer subject to the terms of and in accordance with
_Section 1.1(a)_ and at such time all of the conditions set forth in _Annex
I_ are satisfied and no subsequent expiration date for the Offer is

relieve any Party or Parties hereto, as applicable, from liability for any
knowing and intentional breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants set forth in, or fraud in connection with, this Agreement. In
addition to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement shall affect the
obligations of the parties hereto set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement,

aggregate amount of any payments made by Parent to the Company in respect of
any such breaches of this Agreement. In no event shall Parent be required to
pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding
anything else contained in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to

current or future officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers,
members, Affiliates or successors will be required to pay, individually or in

include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause Merger Sub to take such
action (including an undertaking on the part of Parent to provide to Merger
Sub all funds necessary to take such action). Parent will take all actions
necessary to ensure that, prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not
conduct any business or make any investments or incur or guarantee any
indebtedness other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement.
Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any
action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part
of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the
Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Company to cause such Subsidiary
to take such action.

 



 

9.13 _Parent Guarantee_.

 



 

(a) The Parent Guarantor hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to the Company the full, complete and timely performance, subject
to the terms and conditions hereof, by Parent and Merger Sub of each and every
obligation of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement. The Parent Guarantor
hereby also agrees to fully comply as to itself with _Section 6.2_. If any
default shall be made by Parent or Merger Sub in the performance of any such
obligations, then the Parent Guarantor shall perform or cause to be performed
such obligations immediately upon written notice from the Company specifying
the default. Prior to proceeding against the Parent Guarantor hereunder
(except with respect to the second sentence of this _Section 9.13(a)_), the
Company shall first demand performance from Parent and/or Merger Sub, as
applicable, in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement;
_provided_ ,

 



      
 

 



 

 _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to initiate legal
proceedings against Parent or Merger Sub prior to proceeding against the
Parent Guarantor or demand performance therefrom more than once. Subject to
the terms and conditions hereof, the Parent Guarantor waives (i) any and all
defenses specifically available to a guarantor (other than performance in full
by Parent and/or Merger Sub) and (ii) any notices, including any notice of any
amendment of this Agreement or waiver or other similar action granted pursuant
to this Agreement and any notice of acceptance. The guarantee set forth in
this _Section 9.13_ shall be deemed a continuing guarantee and shall remain
in full force and effect until the satisfaction in full of all obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement. The guarantee set forth in this
_Section 9.13 _is a primary guarantee of performance and not just of
collection.

 



 

(b) The Parent Guarantor is duly incorporated and is valid and subsisting as a
corporation under the Laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada. The Parent
Guarantor has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all
corporate action necessary to execute and deliver this Agreement and perform
its obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Parent Guarantor and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by each of the other parties hereto, this _Section
9.13_ and the provisions referenced in _Section 9.13(d)_ constitute a valid
and binding obligation of the Parent Guarantor, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to the
Enforceability Exceptions. The Parent Guarantor owns, directly or indirectly,
100% of the equity interests in Parent and Merger Sub.

 



 

(c) Except to the extent of the expiration of all statutes of limitations
under applicable Law, no delay of the Company in the exercise of, or failure
to exercise, any rights under the guarantee set forth in this _Section 9.13_
shall operate as a waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights, or a
release of the Parent Guarantor from any of its obligations hereunder. The
Parent Guarantor consents to the renewal, compromise, extension, acceleration
or other changes in the time of payment of, or other changes in the terms of
the obligations subject to, the guarantee set forth in this _Section 9.13_ or
any part thereof, in each case, to the extent Parent has agreed to such change
in writing in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

(d) The Parent Guarantor hereby agrees to be bound by _Sections 6.2_ , _9.2_ ,
_9.4_ , _9.5_ , _9.7_ , _9.8_ , _9.9_ and _9.11_.

 



 

 **[** Remainder of page intentionally left blank **]**

Agreement to be executed by their respective officers hereunto duly authorized
as of the date first above written.

 **CONDITIONS TO THE OFFER**

 



 

Capitalized terms used but not defined in this _Annex I_ shall have the
meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the " **Agreement** ")
of which this _Annex I_ is a part.

 



 

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, subject to the provisions of
the Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or,
subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC (including those
relating to the obligation of Merger Sub to pay for, or return Tendered Shares
promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any Shares
pursuant to the Offer, and Merger Sub may delay its acceptance for payment of
or, subject to the restriction referred to above, its payment for, any
Tendered Shares, and, subject to the provisions of the Agreement, Merger Sub
may amend or terminate the Offer and not accept for payment any Tendered
Shares, if:

 



 

(i) prior to the Expiration Date there shall not be validly tendered (not
including Shares tendered pursuant to procedures for guaranteed delivery and
not actually delivered prior to the Expiration Date) and not properly
withdrawn a number of Shares that, together with the Shares beneficially owned
by Parent and Merger Sub, constitute at least a majority of the total number
of then outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis (which total number shall
be the number of Shares issued and outstanding _plus_ the number of Shares
which the Company would be required to issue pursuant to any then outstanding
warrants, options, benefit plans or obligations or securities convertible or
exchangeable into Shares or otherwise, but whether or not then vested,
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable, but excluding the Top-Up Option, and
regardless of the conversion or exercise price or any other term or condition
thereof (the " **Minimum Condition** "));

 



 

(ii) prior to the Expiration Date, (x) any applicable waiting period (or any
extension thereof) under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated
or (y) the FSA having failed to notify Parent pursuant to Section 189(4)(a) of
the FSMA that the FSA approves of Parent (and any other potential controllers
in Parents group, to the extent required) acquiring control of the Company,
or not being treated as having given such approval pursuant to Section 189(6)
of the FSMA;

 



 

(iii) there shall be in effect any Restraint enjoining or preventing the
acceptance for payment of, or the payment for, the Shares or otherwise
prohibiting consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or any Law shall have
been enacted after the date hereof by a Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction that prohibits or makes illegal the Merger or the acceptance for
payment of, or the payment for, the Shares pursuant to the Offer;

 



 

(iv) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms;

 



 

(v) any Company Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement;

 



 

Annex I - 1     
 

 



 

(vi) as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Acceptance Time (in each
case, except for any representation or warranty that is expressly made as of a
specified date, in which case as of such specified date), (A) any
representation or warranty of the Company contained in _Section 4.1(a)_,
_Section 4.1(b)_, _Section 4.1(c) Section 4.1(d)_, _Section 4.1(r)(i)_ or
_Section 4.1(r)(ii)_ shall not be true and correct in all respects, except
for, in the case of _Section 4.1(c)_, _Section 4.1(r)(i)_ or _Section
4.1(r)(ii)_, _de minimus_ inaccuracies, or (B) any other representation or
warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement shall not be true and
correct (without giving effect to any "materiality", "Company Material Adverse
Effect" or similar qualifiers set forth therein) except where the failure of
such representations and warranties referred to in this clause (B) to be true
and correct, individually or in the aggregate with other such failures, has
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect;

 



 

(vii) the Company shall not have performed or complied in all material
respects with its obligations, agreements and covenants under this Agreement
required to be performed or complied with prior to the Acceptance Time, and
such failure to perform shall not have been cured prior to the Acceptance
Time; or

 



 

(viii) Parent shall not have received a certificate signed on behalf of the
Company by the chief executive officer of the Company certifying as to the
satisfaction of the conditions in paragraphs (v), (vi) and (vii) of this
_Annex I_.

 



 

The conditions to the Offer set forth in this _Annex I_ (except for the
Minimum Condition) are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub, may be
asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances (including
any action or inaction by Parent or Merger Sub, provided nothing herein shall
relieve any party from any obligation or liability such party has under this
Agreement) giving rise to any such condition and may be waived only by Parent
or Merger Sub, in their sole discretion, in whole or in part at any applicable
time and from time to time, in each case subject to the terms and conditions
of the Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. Any
failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such
right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a
waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from
time to time in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 **FX ALLIANCE INC.**

 



 

Pursuant to Sections 242 and 245 of the 
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware

 



 

FX Alliance Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the
State of Delaware (the " _Corporation_ "), hereby certifies as follows:

 



 

1. The name of the Corporation is FX Alliance Inc.

 



 

2. The original certificate of incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on September 22, 2006 and an amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on February 8, 2012.

 



 

3. The provisions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Corporation as herein amended are hereby restated and integrated into the single instrument which is hereinafter set forth, and which is entitled "Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of FX Alliance Inc.."

 



 

4. This second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which restates, integrates and further amends the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, has been duly adopted in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (" _DGCL_ ").

 



 

5. Pursuant to Section 103(d) of the DGCL, this Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation will become effective upon filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

 



 

6. The amended and restated certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, as amended and restated herein, shall read in its entirety as follows:

 



 

 _FIRST_ : The name of the corporation is FX Alliance Inc. (the "
_Corporation_ ").

 



 

 _SECOND_ : The address of the Corporations registered office in the State of
Delaware is 2711 Centerville Road Suite 400 in the City of Wilmington, County
of New Castle, Delaware 19808. The name of its registered agent at such
address is Corporation Service Company.

 



 

 _THIRD_ : The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or
activity for which corporations may be organized under the DGCL.

 



 

 _FOURTH_ : The total number of shares which the Corporation shall have the
authority to issue is 100 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share.

      
 

 



 

 _FIFTH_ : In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by the
laws of the State of Delaware, the board of directors of the Corporation is
expressly authorized to adopt, amend, or repeal the bylaws of the Corporation.

 



 

 _SIXTH_ : Elections of directors need not be by written ballot unless the
bylaws of the Corporation shall otherwise provide.

 



 

 _SEVENTH_ :

 



 

(a) _Limitation of Liability_.

 



 

(i) To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as it now exists or may
hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the
extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader
exculpation rights than permitted prior thereto), no director of the
Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages arising from a breach of fiduciary duty owed to the
Corporation or its stockholders.

 



 

(ii) Any repeal or modification of the foregoing paragraph shall not adversely
affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing
hereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring at or prior to the
time of such repeal or modification.

 



 

(b) _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (including
involvement, without limitation, as a witness) in any actual or threatened
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (a " _proceeding_ "), by reason of the fact that such person is
or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or
officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as an employee or agent of the Corporation or as a director,
officer, partner, member, trustee, administrator, employee or agent of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company,
trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee
benefit plan (an " _indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such proceeding is
alleged action in an official capacity as a director or officer or in any
other capacity while serving as a director or officer, shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the
DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any
such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation
to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto),
against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees and related
disbursements, judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended from time to time ("
_ERISA_ "), and any other penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection
therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has
ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the
benefit of the indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators; provided,
however, that, except as provided in Section (c) of this Article SEVENTH with
respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation
shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part
thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The
right to indemnification conferred in this Section (b) of this Article SEVENTH
shall be a contract right and shall include the obligation of the Corporation
to pay the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of
its

      
 

 



 

final disposition (an " _advance of expenses_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that an advance of expenses incurred by an indemnitee shall be made only upon
delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking (an " _undertaking_ "), by or on
behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no
further right to appeal (a " _final adjudication_ ") that such indemnitee is
not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section (b) or
otherwise. The Corporation may, by action of its Board of Directors, provide
indemnification and advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the
Corporation with the same or lesser scope and effect as the foregoing
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers.

 



 

(c) _Procedure for Indemnification_. Any indemnification of a director or
officer of the Corporation or advance of expenses (including attorneys fees,
costs and charges) under Section (b) of this Article SEVENTH shall be made
promptly, and in any event within forty-five days (or, in the case of an
advance of expenses, twenty days, provided that the director or officer has
delivered the undertaking contemplated by Section (b) of this Article
SEVENTH), upon the written request of the director or officer. If a
determination by the Corporation that the director or officer is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article SEVENTH is required, and the
Corporation fails to respond within sixty days to a written request for
indemnity, the Corporation shall be deemed to have approved the request. If
the Corporation denies a written request for indemnification or advance of
expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in full pursuant to such request
is not made within forty-five days (or, in the case of an advance of expenses,
twenty days, provided that the director or officer has delivered the
undertaking contemplated by Section (b) of this Article SEVENTH), the right to
indemnification or advances as granted by this Article SEVENTH shall be
enforceable by the director or officer in any court of competent jurisdiction.
Such persons costs and expenses incurred in connection with successfully
establishing his or her right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any
such action shall also be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a
defense to any action by a director or officer for indemnification or the
advance of expenses (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the
advance of expenses where the undertaking required pursuant to Section (b) of
this Article SEVENTH, if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the
claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under
the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed,
but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither
the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent
legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in
the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its
stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. The procedure for
indemnification of other employees and agents for whom indemnification and
advancement of expenses is provided pursuant to Section (b) of this Article
SEVENTH shall be the same procedure set forth in this Section (c) for
directors or officers, unless otherwise set forth in the action of the Board
of Directors providing indemnification and advancement of expenses for such
employee or agent.

 



 

(d) _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on its
own behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was or has agreed to become a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving
at the request of the

      
 

 



 

Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense,
liability or loss asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in
any such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not
the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expenses, liability or loss under the DGCL.

 



 

(e) _Service for Subsidiaries_. Any person serving as a director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture or other enterprise, at least 50% of whose equity
interests are owned directly or indirectly by the Corporation (a "subsidiary"
for this Article SEVENTH) shall be conclusively presumed to be serving in such
capacity at the request of the Corporation.

 



 

(f) _Reliance_. Persons who after the date of the adoption of this provision
become or remain directors or officers of the Corporation or who, while a
director or officer of the Corporation, become or remain a director, officer,
employee or agent of a subsidiary, shall be conclusively presumed to have
relied on the rights to indemnity, advance of expenses and other rights
contained in this Article SEVENTH in entering into or continuing such service.
The rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in this
ARTICLE SEVENTH shall apply to claims made against an indemnitee arising out
of acts or omissions which occurred or occur both prior and subsequent to the
adoption hereof.

 



 

(g) _Other Rights; Continuation of Right to Indemnification_. The rights to
indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in this Article
SEVENTH shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or
hereafter acquire under this Certificate of Incorporation or under any
statute, by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or
otherwise. All rights to indemnification under this Article SEVENTH shall be
deemed to be a contract between the Corporation and each director or officer
of the Corporation who serves or served in such capacity at any time while
this Article SEVENTH is in effect. Any repeal or modification of this Article
SEVENTH or any repeal or modification of relevant provisions of the DGCL or
any other applicable laws shall not in any way diminish any rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses of such director or officer or the
obligations of the Corporation arising hereunder with respect to any
proceeding arising out of, or relating to, any actions, transactions or facts
occurring prior to the final adoption of such repeal or modification.

 



 

(h) _Merger or Consolidation_. For purposes of this Article SEVENTH,
references to the "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was
a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is
or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under this Article
SEVENTH with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she
would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate
existence had continued.

 



 

(i) _Savings Clause_. If this Article SEVENTH or any portion hereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Corporation shall

      
 

 



 

nevertheless indemnify and advance expenses to each person entitled to
indemnification under Section (b) of this Article SEVENTH as to all expense,
liability and loss (including attorneys fees and related disbursements,
judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties, and any other penalties
and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) actually and reasonably incurred
or suffered by such person and for which indemnification or advancement of
expenses is available to such person pursuant to this Article SEVENTH to the
fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article SEVENTH
that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law.

 



 

 _EIGHTH_ : The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change, or
repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the
manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred herein
are granted subject to this reservation.

      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused this second amended and
restated certificate of incorporation to be executed and acknowledged by its
duly authorized officer this day of , 2012.
