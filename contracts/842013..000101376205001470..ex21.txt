this  Agreement  and Plan of Merger  and the  separate  corporate  existence  of
Omnimed shall cease and the  Acquirer,  as it exists from and after the Closing,
shall be the Surviving Company.

Effect of the Merger

2.2 The Merger shall have the effect provided  therefor by the State Corporation
Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,  and subject thereto,  at
Closing (i) all the rights, privileges,  immunities, powers and franchises, of a
public as well as of a private  nature,  and all  property,  real,  personal and
mixed,  and all debts due on  whatever  account,  including  without  limitation
subscriptions to shares, and all other choses in action, and all and every other
interest  of or  belonging  to or due to  Omnimed or the  Acquirer,  as a group,
subject to the terms hereof, shall be taken and deemed to be transferred to, and
vested in, the Surviving  Company without further act or deed; and all property,
rights and privileges, immunities, powers and franchises and all and every other
interest  shall be  thereafter  as  effectually  the  property of the  Surviving
Company,  as they were of Omnimed  and the  Acquirer,  as a group,  and (ii) all
debts,  liabilities,  duties and  obligations of Omnimed and the Acquirer,  as a
group,  subject to the terms  hereof,  shall become the debts,  liabilities  and
duties of the Surviving  Company and the Surviving  Company shall thenceforth be
responsible  and liable for all debts,  liabilities,  duties and  obligations of
Omnimed and the  Acquirer,  as a group,  and neither the rights of creditors nor
any liens upon the  property of Omnimed or the  Acquirer,  as a group,  shall be
impaired by the Merger, and may be enforced against the Surviving Company.

Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws; Directors and Officers

2.3 The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Company from and after the

2.4 At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the Acquirer, Omnimed or the Omnimed Shareholders, the shares of capital
stock of each of Omnimed and the Acquirer shall be converted as follows:

     (a)  Capital Stock of the Acquirer.  Each issued and  outstanding  share of
          the  Acquirer's   capital  stock  shall  continue  to  be  issued  and
          outstanding  and shall be converted into one share of validly  issued,
          fully paid, and non-assessable  common stock of the Surviving Company.
          Each stock  certificate  of the Acquirer  evidencing  ownership of any
          such shares  shall  continue to evidence  ownership  of such shares of
          capital stock of the Surviving Company.

     (b)  Conversion  of Omnimed  Shares.  Each Omnimed Share that is issued and
          outstanding at the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and
          extinguished  and  converted,  without  any  action on the part of the
          holder  thereof,  into  the  right to  receive  at the time and in the
          amounts  described in this Agreement an amount of  Acquisition  Shares
          equal to the  number of  Acquisition  Shares  divided by the number of
          Omnimed  Shares  outstanding  immediately  prior to Closing.  All such
          Omnimed Shares, when so converted,  shall no longer be outstanding and
          shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist,
          and each holder of a  certificate  representing  any such shares shall
          cease to have any rights  with  respect  thereto,  except the right to
          receive the Acquisition Shares paid in consideration therefor upon the
          surrender of such certificate in accordance with this Agreement.

Adherence with Applicable Securities Laws

2.5 The  Omnimed  Shareholders  agree that they are  acquiring  the  Acquisition
Shares for investment  purposes and will not offer, sell or otherwise  transfer,
pledge or hypothecate any of the  Acquisition  Shares issued to them (other than
pursuant to an effective  Registration  Statement  under the  Securities  Act of
1933, as amended) directly or indirectly unless:
