   4.3 | Third Party Offer 
---|--- 

If a third party launches an offer for all Company Shares within the meaning
of Article 74 section 1 Public Offerings Act, (Third Party Offer), the
Management Board shall be entitled to recommend such Third Party Offer to the
Companys Shareholders, provided that

 



     | (a) | the Management Board, acting reasonably and in good faith,
determines that such Third Party Offer is more favorable to the Company, the
Company Shareholders and its stakeholders than the Offer, taking into
account, without limitation, all of the terms and conditions of the Third
Party Offer including its conditionality, the likelihood of its completion in
accordance with its terms and the likely timing of the transaction; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | Superior has not amended the Offer within five (5) Business
Days (a day on which the Warsaw Stock Exchange and banks in Poland are open
for regular business) following information by the Management Board of the
Company that in good faith and based on external expert legal and/or financial
advice by a reputable law firm and/or investment bank or audit firm, the Third
Party Offer is more favorable to the Company, the Companys Shareholders and
its stakeholders than the Offer in the view of the Companys Management Board 
---|---|--- 

(such Third Party Offer as set forth under (a) and (b) being an Advantageous
Offer).



   4.4 | Advantageous Bidder Offer 
---|--- 

If Superior amends the Offer as set forth above under Section 4.3(b), thus
transforming it into a Advantageous Bidder Offer, i.e. an offer that, compared
to the Advantageous Offer, meets the requirements set forth in Section 4.3(a),
all provisions herein, in particular the obligations of the Parties that
relate to the Offer, shall, from the date of such transformation, relate to
the Advantageous Bidder Offer in lieu of the Offer.

---|--- 



   5.1 | Joint Strategic Objectives 
---|--- 



     | (a) | By effecting the Transaction, the Parties intend to create a
leading aluminum wheel manufacturer with a leading presence in major American
and European markets. The combined facility footprints in Mexico and Poland
will enable global competitiveness. 
---|---|--- 
 



11 and Superior Group will reduce customer and geographic concentration and
provide aftermarket opportunities in major American and European markets.  
---|---|--- 

The Company and Superior intend to pool their resources by mutual agreement,
particularly in the areas of technology, process expertise, IT, financial
resources, engineering and program management in a manner which fuels further
expansion and ensures that each benefits to a maximum extent from the know-
how, specialty capabilities and experience of the other in the relevant area.



   5.2 | Company Strategy 
---|--- 

As soon as reasonably possible after Closing, Superior, the Bidder and the
Company will jointly develop and determine, in good faith, the future strategy
of the combined Uniwheels and Superior businesses.

   7. | WORKFORCE AND EMPLOYEES 
---|--- 



   7.1 | General Framework 
---|--- 

Superior acknowledges that the dedicated workforce of the Company and the
Uniwheels Affiliates is the foundation of the current and future success of
the Uniwheels Group. Superior expressly views the Transaction as an
opportunity for growth for the workforce of Uniwheels Group and other
stakeholders and not as an acquisition which is directed towards cost
reductions to the detriment of the workforce of Uniwheels Group. Superior
intends to continue and further strengthen a constructive dialogue with all of
workforce constituencies of the Uniwheels Group and to support the Management
Board in maintaining and developing an attractive and competitive framework to
retain an excellent and worldwide employee base.



   7.2 | Headcount 
---|--- 

Superior and the Bidder undertake not to cause the Company to take
any actions that would lead to a significant reduction of the Uniwheels
Groups existing level of employment.



   7.3 | Management and Incentives 
---|--- 



     | (a) | The Parties anticipate that the Uniwheels Groups incumbent
Key Management Team will continue leading the business operations of the
Uniwheels Group (across all dimensions including scheduling, pricing,
client interaction, technology) and pursuing an attractive career in the
combined business, unless mutually agreed. The members of the Key Management
Team are set out in Annex 7.3(a). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | The Parties further anticipate that between announcement and
completion of the Offer an appropriate compensation scheme will be agreed with
the Key Management Team of the Group. 
---|---|--- 
 



12 ---|--- 

Superior and the Bidder acknowledge that the Company owns several strong
brands in certain countries with a high degree of brand awareness by the
respective markets and customers. The Parties agree that the names and logos /
trademarks of the operative brands and company names used by the Group in the
aftermarket (accessory) and international motorsport business will not change
after the implementation of the Transaction.

 

As soon as reasonably possible after Closing Superior, the Bidder and the
Company will jointly determine the future name of the Company.

 



   9. | CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
---|---

Supervisory Board as agreed in the Irrevocable or otherwise, the Management
Board will apply to the Ludwigshafen Local Court for at least two persons
nominated by the Bidder to be appointed as new members of the Supervisory
Board, unless there is an important cause against such appointment recumbent
in a nominee.

---|--- 



     | (a) | Superior has trust and confidence in the current members of
the Management Board and will support the Management Board and the Key
Management Team.

that an action directed, demanded or instructed by Superior or the Bidder
would constitute a disadvantageous legal transaction (
_nachteiliges Rechtsgesch aft_) within the meaning of Section 311 of the
Stock Corporation Act, it will inform, without undue delay, the Bidder
accordingly. Should the Bidder nonetheless request the action, direction or
demand to be implemented, the Bidder will compensate the Company for any
disadvantages out of or in connection with the implementation of the action,
direction or demand in accordance with Section 311Stock Corporation Act. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) | Superior and the Bidder intend that the members of the
Management Board will be included into the Superior senior management team at
the first level.

into this Agreement in the future, be or become invalid or unenforceable, the
validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement shall not
be affected thereby. The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed to
be substituted by a suitable and equitable provision which, to the extent
legally permissible, comes as close as possible to the intent and purpose of
the invalid or unenforceable provision. The same shall apply: (i) if the
Parties have, unintentionally, failed to address a certain matter in this
Agreement ( _Regelungsl ucke_); in this case a suitable and equitable
provision shall be deemed to have been agreed upon which comes as close as
possible to what the Parties, in the light of the intent and purpose of this
Agreement, would have agreed upon if they had considered the matter; or (ii)
if any provision of this Agreement is invalid because of the scope of any time
period or performance stipulated herein; in this case a legally permissible
