under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or

# Article II 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

  

## Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Acquiror,
Acquisition Sub, the Company or the holders of Shares or securities of the
Company, Acquiror or Acquisition Sub:

  

### (a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section
2.1(b)(i)_ or any Shares to be converted into shares of the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)(ii)_ ) and other than as provided in
_Section 2.4_ ) will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted into the
right to receive the following consideration, payable to the holder of each
Share (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") upon surrender of either the
certificate formerly representing such Share (" _Certificates_ ") or any
corresponding book-entry Share (" _Book-Entry Share_ ") in the manner provided
in _Section 2.2_ : (i) $41.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Per Share Cash
Amount_ ") (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") and (ii) the right to receive from
Acquiror an additional amount of cash (the " _Conversion Consideration_ ") in
euros equal to the par value of 0.12883 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") shares of
common stock, par value EUR 0.01 per share, of Acquiror (" _Acquiror Common
Stock_ "), which Conversion Consideration will not actually be paid to the
holders of Shares but will instead be converted into shares of Acquiror Common
Stock immediately following the Effective Time, as more fully set forth in
_Section 2.1(d)_. All Shares, when so converted into the Merger
Consideration, will no longer be outstanding and will be automatically
cancelled, retired and cease to exist. Each holder of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except
the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration for such Shares upon the
surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
_Section 2.2_ , without interest and (ii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any
fractional share of Acquiror Common Stock in accordance with _Section 2.6_. 

  

### 

  

  

 -6- 

       

  

  



  

### (b) (i) Each share of Company Common Stock held in
the treasury of the Company and each Share owned directly by Acquiror or
Acquisition Sub immediately before the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
extinguished, and no payment or other consideration will be made with respect
to such shares.

  

#### (ii) Each Share held by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company, any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Acquiror (other than Acquisition Sub) or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into such number of shares of common stock, no par value, of the
Surviving Corporation such that the ownership percentage of any such
Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective
Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such Subsidiary in the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

### (c) Each share of common stock, no par value, of
Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time
will thereafter represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### (d) Immediately following the Effective Time, without any
further action by Acquiror, Acquisition Sub, the Company or the holders of
Shares or securities of the Company, Acquiror or Acquisition Sub, the
Conversion Consideration otherwise (but for the provisions of this _Section
2.1(d)_ ) payable to each former holder of Shares will be converted
automatically into an aggregate number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock
equal to the total amount of Conversion Consideration payable to such holder
of Shares as set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_ , divided by the par value of a
single share of Acquiror Common Stock, subject to _Section 2.6_. The shares of
Acquiror Common Stock issuable to each former holder of Shares pursuant to the
preceding sentence will, for all purposes of Dutch Law, be deemed to be fully
paid ( _volgestort_ ) by way of setoff ( _verrekening_ ) against the
obligation of Acquiror to pay Conversion Consideration to such former holder
of Shares as set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_.

  

### (e) The shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued to
former holders of Shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ will be issued by way of
notation by the Company in the shareholders register (
_aandeelhoudersregister_ ) of Acquiror, without the need for any further
formalities and without the need for any delivery of share certificates (
_aandeelbewijzen_ ) representing such shares of Acquiror Common Stock, except
if and to the extent that a Person receiving shares of Acquiror Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ specifically requests Acquiror in writing to
deliver share certificates representing such Shares to such Person, in which
case Acquiror will deliver share certificates to such Person representing the
appropriate number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, in accordance with
Acquiror's normal procedures for delivery of share certificates upon request
by holders of Acquiror Common Stock. The Company shall not be obligated to
make the notation on Acquiror's shareholders register referred to in the
preceding sentence in respect of any former holder of Shares, or to deliver
share certificates to any former holder of Shares as referred to in the
preceding sentence, except if and to the extent that the Acquiror has received
notice from the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)(i)_ that the
relevant former holder of Shares has surrendered his Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the procedures set forth
in _Section 2.2(b)(i)_.

  

##

## Section 2.2 _Payment; Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_.

  

### (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror will designate a
national bank or trust company, that is reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, to act as agent for the holders of Shares in connection with the
Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to receive the cash necessary to make the
cash payments contemplated by _Section 2.1(a)_ after giving effect to the
provisions of _Section 2.1(d)_. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than two Business Days following the Effective Time, Acquiror
or the Surviving Corporation shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust
with the Exchange Agent in a separate account for the benefit of holders of
Shares (the " _Exchange Fund_ ") the aggregate cash to which such holders
shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ after
giving effect to the provisions of _Section 2.1(d)_. If for any reason the
cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the
payment obligations to be made by the Exchange Agent hereunder (including the
payment of any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Acquiror
Common Stock in accordance with _Section 2.6_ ), the Surviving Corporation
shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount which is equal
to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such payment
obligations.

  

### (b) (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, and in any event within five Business Days thereafter, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share whose Shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal
(which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to
the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and such letter of
transmittal will be in customary form) and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, the surrender of such Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may
thereafter until the first anniversary of the Effective Time surrender such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent under cover of the
letter of transmittal, as agent for such holder. Upon delivery of a duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on or before the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay the holder of
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in exchange for the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Cash Amount
multiplied by the number of Shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares plus cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Acquiror Common
Stock pursuant to _Section 2.6_. Until so surrendered, Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares (other than Shares held by Acquiror, Acquisition Sub, or any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Acquiror, direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Acquisition Sub, and Shares held in the treasury of the Company)
will represent solely the right to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration
relating to the Shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.
The Exchange Agent will, within five days of any surrender of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.2(b)(i)_ , notify Acquiror of
such surrender, whereupon Acquiror will, in accordance with its normal
procedures for issuance of new shares, make the appropriate entries in
Acquiror's shareholders register, as set forth in _Section 2.1(e)_ , in
respect of the number of shares of Acquiror

  

  

 -8- 

       

  

  

Common Stock issuable upon such surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ , taking into account (to the extent applicable)
the provisions of _Section 2.2(b)(ii)_.

  

#### (ii) If all or any portion of the Cash Consideration, or all
or any portion of the shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable pursuant to
_Section 2.1(d)_ , in each case in respect of cancelled Shares, is to be paid
or issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name surrendered
Certificates are registered, it will be a condition to such payment or
issuance, as applicable, that (A) the Certificates so surrendered will be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that (B) the
Person requesting payment of Cash Consideration, or issuance of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock, to a person other than the Person in whose name the
relevant surrendered Certificates are registered, shall have paid any transfer
and other Taxes required by reason of such payment of Cash Consideration, or
issuance of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, to a person other than the
registered holder of the Certificates surrendered, or shall have established
to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent and Acquiror that such Tax is not
applicable. The Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ , including
shares of Acquiror Common Stock issued pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ , will be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares theretofore represented by such Certificates.

  

### (c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company will be closed and there will not be any further registration of
transfers of any shares of the Company's capital stock thereafter on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares will cease to have any rights with respect
to any Shares, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement or by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares (other than Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Shares held
by Acquiror, Acquisition Sub or any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of Acquiror, direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Acquisition Sub, and Shares held
in the treasury of the Company) are presented to the Surviving Corporation,
they will be cancelled and exchanged for Merger Consideration, including
shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ , as
provided in this _Article II_. No interest will accrue or be paid on any cash
payable upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares which
immediately before the Effective Time represented the Shares.

  

### (d) Promptly following the date which is one year after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any cash, including any interest received with
respect to such cash, Certificates and other documents in its possession
relating to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (together with the Merger, the " _Transactions_ "), which had been
made available to the Exchange Agent and which have not been disbursed to
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or previously delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, and thereafter such holders will be entitled to look to
(i) the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws) only as general creditors of the Surviving Corporation with
respect to the Cash Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest on such Cash
Consideration and (ii) to Acquiror, with respect to the shares of Acquiror
Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ upon surrender of their
Certificates

  

  

 -9- 

       

  

  

or Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Acquiror, the
Surviving Corporation, any Subsidiary of Acquiror or the Exchange Agent will
be liable to any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for Merger
Consideration delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. The obligation of Acquiror to
issue shares of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to the Merger to any former
holder of Shares shall absolutely and finally terminate and expire (
_vervallen_ ), without any limitation or restriction whatsoever, at such time
as such former holder of Shares, as a result of abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws applicable within the United States, or for any other reason
based on Laws applicable within the United States, ceases to be entitled to
receive from the Surviving Corporation the Cash Consideration in respect of
such holder's Shares.

  

### (e) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from cash amounts payable under this
Agreement, such amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the
Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

  

### (f) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Acquiror or
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any Action that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall (i) pay, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Cash Consideration to be paid in respect
of the Shares represented by such Certificates as contemplated by this
_Article II_ and (ii) notify the Acquiror of such payment, whereupon the
Acquiror will issue to the holder of the relevant lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, in the manner set forth in _Section 2.1(e)_ , the appropriate
number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock issuable in respect of the Shares
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate as set forth in
_Section 2.1(d)_. 

  

## Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Stock Plans_.

  

### (a) Each option to purchase Shares granted pursuant to a
Company Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested (each, an " _Option_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, as of the
Effective Time, be converted into an option (an " _Adjusted Option_ ") to
purchase, on the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting
and exercisability) as were applicable to such Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, rounded down to
the nearest whole share, determined by multiplying the number of Shares
subject to such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Equity
Award Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Acquiror Common Stock,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent, equal to the per share exercise price
for the Shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time divided by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the adjustments provided in this _Section 2.3(a)_ with
respect to any Options, whether or not they are "incentive stock options" as
defined in Section 422 of the Code, are intended to be

  

  

 -10- 

       

  

effected in a manner that is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code and
Section 409A of the Code.

  

  

### (b) Each stock appreciation right granted pursuant to a
Company Stock Plan, whether vested or unvested (each, a " _SAR_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall, as of the
Effective Time, be converted into a stock appreciation right (an " _Adjusted
SAR_ "), on the same terms and conditions (including with respect to vesting
and exercisability) as were applicable to such SAR immediately prior to the
Effective Time, in respect of the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock,
rounded down to the nearest whole share, determined by multiplying the number
of Shares subject to such SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time by the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Acquiror Common
Stock rounded up to the nearest whole cent, equal to the per share exercise
price for the Shares otherwise subject to such SAR immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the adjustments provided in this _Section 2.3(b)_ with
respect to any SARs are intended to be effected in a manner that is consistent
with Section 409A of the Code.

  

### (c) Each award of a right under any Company Stock Plan that
is outstanding as of the date of this Agreement (other than awards of Options
or SARs, the treatment of which is specified in _Section 2.3(a)_ and _Section
2.3(b)_ ) entitling the holder thereof to shares of Company Common Stock (or,
at the option of the Company, cash) (each, a _" Stock-Settled Share Unit_")
and that remains outstanding or payable as of the Effective Time shall become
fully vested and shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of
a vested Stock-Settled Share Unit shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of each Share underlying the cancelled vested Stock-
Settled Share Unit (with the Conversion Consideration so payable to such
holder being immediately converted into the appropriate number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock as set forth in _Section 2.1(d)_ ), as soon as
reasonably practicable (but in no event later than five Business Days)
following the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that
payment of Cash Consideration, or issuance of shares of Acquiror Common Stock,
to any holder of a Stock-Settled Share Unit pursuant to this sentence would
cause any additional Taxes to be payable pursuant to Section 409A of the Code
with respect to a Stock-Settled Share Unit, the payment of such Cash
Consideration, or issuance of shares of Acquiror Common Stock, as applicable,
shall instead be made at the time specified in the applicable Company Stock
Plan and related award document.

  

### (d) Each award of a right under any Company Stock Plan that
is outstanding as of the date hereof (other than awards of Options or SARs,
the treatment of which is specified in _Section 2.3(a)_ and _Section 2.3(b)_ )
entitling the holder thereof solely to cash equal to or based on the value of
Shares (each, a _" Cash-Settled Share Unit_" and, together with the Stock-
Settled Share Units, the _"_ _Pre-Signing Share Units_ _"_ ) and that remains
outstanding or payable as of the Effective Time shall become fully vested and
shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each holder of a vested Cash-
Settled Share Unit shall be entitled to receive an amount, in cash, equal to
the Equity Award Consideration in respect of each Share underlying the
cancelled vested Cash-Settled Share Unit, as soon as reasonably practicable
(but in no event later than five Business Days) following the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , in the event that such payment would cause any
additional Taxes to be payable pursuant to Section 409A of the Code with
respect to a Cash-Settled Share

  

  

 -11-     

  

  

Unit, the payment shall instead be made at the time specified in the
applicable Company Stock Plan and related award document.

  

### (e) Each award of a right under any Company Stock Plan that
is granted after the date hereof as permitted under _Section 5.1_ entitling
the holder thereof to shares of Company Common Stock or cash equal to or based
on the value of Shares (each, a _" Post-Signing Share Unit_") and that remains
outstanding or payable as of the Effective Time shall be converted as of the
Effective Time into (A) a restricted share unit award (an _"_ _Adjusted Share
Unit_ _"_ ), with the same terms and conditions (including with respect to
vesting) (provided that, to the extent necessary to comply with mandatory
requirements of Dutch Law, the holder of such Adjusted Share Unit may be
required to pay Acquiror the aggregate par value of the shares of Acquiror
Common Stock issuable under such Adjusted Share Unit, prior to issuance of
such shares to such holder) as were applicable to such Post-Signing Share Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time, covering the number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share, determined by
multiplying the number of Shares subject to such award immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio and (B) cash in lieu of
any fractional Adjusted Share Unit lost to such rounding in the amount set
forth in _Section 2.6_ , which cash shall be payable as soon as reasonably
practicable (but in no event later than five Business Days) following the
Effective Time ( _provided_ , _however_ , in the event that such cash payment
would cause any additional Taxes to be payable pursuant to Section 409A of the
Code with respect to a Post-Signing Share Unit, the payment shall instead be
made at the time specified in the applicable Company Stock Plan and related
award document).

  

### (f) " _Equity Award Exchange Ratio "_ means the number
equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Equity Award Consideration
by (ii) the closing price of Acquiror Common Stock on the trading day

Section 16 Officer Performance Cash Unit Award Agreement issued pursuant to

first sentence of _Section 6.8(a)_. 

  

### (h) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Acquiror
shall take all actions necessary to effectuate the treatment of the Options,
SARs and Share Units (collectively, the " _Company Equity Awards_ ")
contemplated by this _Section 2.3 _ and to ensure that neither any holder of
a Company Equity Award nor any other participant in any Company Stock Plan
shall have any right thereunder to acquire any securities of the Company or
the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment or benefit with respect to
any award previously granted under the Company Stock Plan, except as provided
in this _Section 2.3_. 

  

### (i) Acquiror shall take all corporate action necessary to

statement on an appropriate form, or a post-effective amendment to a

outstanding. As of the Effective Time, Acquiror shall be responsible for the
Company Stock Plans under which Adjusted Options, Adjusted SARs and Adjusted

holder of the applicable Pre-Signing Share Unit by Acquisition Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent.

  

## Section 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.2_ ,
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has voted against the Merger and who has properly exercised
dissenters' rights with respect thereto in accordance with Section 12:131 of
the LBCL shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, and holders of such Shares shall instead be entitled to receive
payment of the fair cash value of such Shares in accordance with Section
12:131 of the LBCL, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses the right to payment of the fair cash value of such Shares
under the LBCL. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses the right to payment of the fair cash value of
such Shares under the LBCL, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive (i) the Cash
Consideration and (ii) (after giving effect to the provisions of _Section
2.1(d)_ in respect of the Conversion Consideration otherwise payable to such
holder) shares of Acquiror Common Stock as set forth in _Section 2.1(d)_. The
Company shall give Acquiror prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company pursuant to Section 12:131 of the LBCL, and Acquiror, at its expense,
shall have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to such demands so long as Acquiror does not create any obligations for the
Company effective prior to the Effective Time. Except with the prior written
consent of Acquiror, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to,
or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the
outstanding shares of capital stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for shares of capital stock, of the Company or Acquiror
shall occur as a result of any merger, business combination, reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision
or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Per Share Cash
Amount and/or the Exchange Ratio, as applicable, shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide Acquiror and the holders of Shares the same economic
benefit as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided _
that nothing in this _Section 2.5_ shall be construed to permit the Company or
Acquiror to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

## Section 2.6 _Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip
representing fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates or with respect to Book-Entry
Shares, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Acquiror.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Common Stock converted by virtue of the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock,
shall receive, in lieu of such fraction of a share of Acquiror Common Stock,
cash, without interest, in United States dollars in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Acquiror Common Stock multiplied by the Acquiror

outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company
Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Superior Proposal, then the Company may, directly or indirectly, (i)
furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its

### Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives and potential sources of
financing regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means any customary
confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable
to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure
Agreement, dated May 23, 2012, between the Company and Acquiror (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") (including standstill restrictions), provided
that such confidentiality agreement (x) shall not prohibit compliance by the
Company with any of the provisions of this _Section 5.3_ and (y) may contain a
less restrictive standstill restriction or no standstill restriction, in which
case the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to contain
only such less restrictive provision, or to omit such provision, as
applicable.

  

### (c) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than
24 hours after receipt) notify, orally and in writing, Acquiror after receipt
by the Company or any of its Representatives of any Company Takeover Proposal,
including of the identity of the Person making the Company Takeover Proposal
and the material terms and conditions thereof, and shall promptly (and in no
event later than 24 hours after receipt) provide copies to Acquiror of any
written proposals, indications of interest, and/or draft agreements relating
to such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep Acquiror reasonably
informed, on a prompt basis, as to the status of (including changes to any
material terms of, and any other material developments with respect to) such
Company Takeover Proposal (including by promptly (and in no event later than
24 hours after receipt) providing to Acquiror copies of any additional or
revised written proposals, indications of interest, and/or draft agreements
relating to such Company Takeover Proposal). The Company agrees that it and
its Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement with any Person subsequent
to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any
information to Acquiror in accordance with this _Section 5.3_.

  

### (d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3(d)_ ,
the Company Board shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation
in the Joint Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, or authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold,
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Acquiror, the Company
Recommendation, (C) take any formal action or make any recommendation or
public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer (other
than a recommendation against such offer or a customary "stop, look and
listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act, in each case that includes a reaffirmation of the Company
Recommendation) (it being understood that the Company Board may refrain from
taking a position with respect to such a tender offer or exchange offer until
the close of business as of the tenth Business Day after the commencement of
such tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act without such action being considered a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change) or (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose
to adopt, approve or recommend to shareholders of the Company a Company
Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to
as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii) authorize, cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement, commitment or agreement in principle with respect to any
Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in accordance with _Section 5.3(b)_ ). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the Company
Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board may (x) make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change or

  

  

 -55-     

  

  



  

### (y) terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(e)_ in order
to enter into a binding written agreement with respect to such Company
Superior Proposal, in each case if, after receiving a bona fide, unsolicited
Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of _Section 5.3_,
the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that (I) such Company
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (II) in light of
such Company Takeover Proposal, the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to constitute a violation of the Company Board's fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to taking
the action set forth in clause (x) or (y) above, as applicable, (1) the
Company has given Acquiror at least four Business Days' prior written notice
of its intention to take such action (which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of any such Company Superior Proposal) and has
contemporaneously provided to Acquiror a copy of the Company Superior
Proposal, a copy of any proposed transaction agreements with the Person making
such Company Superior Proposal and a copy of any financing commitments
relating thereto (or, if not provided in writing to the Company, a written
summary of the material terms thereof), (2) the Company has negotiated, and
has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Acquiror
during such notice period, to the extent Acquiror wishes to negotiate, to
enable Acquiror to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that
it would cause such Company Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Company Superior Proposal, (3) following the end of such notice period, the
Company Board shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms
of this Agreement proposed in writing by Acquiror, and shall have determined,
after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that the Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to
constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Acquiror
were to be given effect, and (4) in the event of any change to any of the
financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of
consideration) or any other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal,
the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Acquiror an additional
notice consistent with that described in clause (1) above of this proviso and
a new notice period under clause (1) of this proviso shall commence (except
that the four Business Day period notice period referred to in clause (1)
above of this proviso shall instead be equal to the longer of (I) two Business
Days and (II) the period remaining under the notice period under clause (1) of
this proviso immediately prior to the delivery of such additional notice under
this clause (4)) during which time the Company shall be required to comply
with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(d)_ anew with respect to such
additional notice, including clauses (1) through (4) above of this proviso;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company has complied in all material
respect with its obligations under this _Section 5.3_.

  

### (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior
to the time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board
may change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly
propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse
to Acquiror, the Company Recommendation (" _Intervening Event Recommendation
Change_ "), if, in response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to make such Intervening
Event Recommendation Change would reasonably be likely to constitute a
violation of the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such action shall not be in response to a
Company Takeover Proposal or a Company Superior Proposal (which is addressed
under _Section 5.3(d)_) and prior to taking such action, (i) the Company
Board has given Acquiror at least four Business Days' prior written notice of
its intention to

  

  

 -56-     

  

  



  

### make such Intervening Event Recommendation Change and a reasonable
description of the Intervening Event that serves as the basis of such
Intervening Event Recommendation Change, (ii) the Company has negotiated, and
has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Acquiror
during such notice period after giving any such notice, to the extent Acquiror
wishes to negotiate, to enable Acquiror to propose revisions to the terms of
this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for making such
Intervening Event Recommendation Change, (iii) at the end of such notice
period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any revisions to
the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Acquiror, and shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that failure to make an Intervening Event
Recommendation Change would nevertheless reasonably be likely to constitute a
violation of the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law if the
revisions proposed were to be given effect and (iv) in the event of each and
every change to the material facts and circumstances relating to such
Intervening Event, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Acquiror
an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (i) above of
this proviso and a new notice period under clause (i) of this proviso shall
commence (except that the four Business Day notice period referred to in
clause (i) above of this proviso shall instead be equal to the longer of (I)
two Business Days and (II) the period remaining under the notice period under
clause (i) of this proviso immediately prior to the delivery of such
additional notice under this clause (iv)), during which time the Company shall
be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(e) _ anew
with respect to such additional notice, including clauses (i) through (iv)
above of this proviso.

  

### (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ or in _Section
6.6_ shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and
disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any "stop, look
and listen" communication or any other similar disclosure to the Company's
shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if, in the
Company Board's determination in good faith after consultation with outside
counsel, the failure so to disclose would reasonably be likely to constitute a
violation of the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law or its
obligations under applicable federal securities Law; _provided_ , that any
such position or disclosure (other than any stop, look and listen
communication that includes a reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation)
shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Company Board expressly and concurrently reaffirms the Company Recommendation.

  

## Section 5.4 _Acquiror Recommendation_. Except as expressly
permitted by this _Section 5.4,_ the Acquiror Boards shall not (i) fail to
include the Acquiror Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement or (ii)
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly
propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse
to the Company, the Acquiror Recommendation (any action described in clause
(i) or (ii) being referred to as a " _Acquiror Adverse Recommendation Change_
"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the time the Acquiror Shareholder Approval is obtained, the Acquiror
Boards may make an Acquiror Adverse Recommendation Change if the Acquiror
Boards have determined in good faith, after consultation with their outside
financial advisors and based on the advice of outside legal counsel, that the
failure to so make an Acquiror Adverse Recommendation Change would (i)
constitute a violation of the Acquiror Boards' fiduciary duties to Acquiror's
shareholders or of other legal duties applicable to the

  

  

 -57-     

  

  

Acquiror Boards and their members under Dutch Law or (ii) otherwise create a
significant risk under Dutch Law of material personal liability for the
members of either of the Acquiror Boards.

other Transactions. The Company and Acquiror will cause the Joint Proxy

applicable federal securities Laws. Subject to _Section 5.3(d)_ and _Section
5.3(e)_ , the Joint Proxy Statement will contain the Company Recommendation
and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its

all other actions necessary or advisable to obtain the Company Shareholder
Approval. Subject to _Section 5.4_ , the Joint Proxy Statement will contain
the Acquiror Recommendation and Acquiror shall use reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of the
consummation of the Transactions and to take all other actions necessary or
advisable to obtain the Acquiror Shareholder Approval. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, each of the Company and Acquiror (i) shall
provide the other and/or its counsel an opportunity to review and comment on
such document (including the proposed final version of such document) and (ii)
shall consider in good faith all comments reasonably proposed by the other or
their respective counsels.

  

### (b) The Company and Acquiror will provide for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement of all
reasonably required information relating to the Company, Acquiror or
Acquisition Sub or their respective Affiliates. Each of the Company and
Acquiror will provide the other and its outside legal counsel, in writing, any
comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that it or its
outside legal counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement promptly after the
receipt of such comments or other communications, and the opportunity to
review and comment on such comments. The Company and Acquiror will respond
promptly to any such comments from the SEC or its staff, and will use its
reasonable best efforts to incorporate any reasonable comments of the other
and/or its counsel prior to such response. Acquiror shall advise the Company,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the
Form S-4, the issuance of any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of
the qualification of the Acquiror Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for

  

  

 -58-     

  

  

offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and Acquiror shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or
otherwise terminated. Acquiror shall also take any other action (other than
qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which Acquiror is not now so
qualified) required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" Laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder in connection with the issuance of Acquiror Common
Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all information concerning
the Company and the holders of its capital stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such actions.

  

### (c) Each of the Company and Acquiror agrees to promptly (i)
correct any information provided by it specifically for use in the Form S-4 or
Joint Proxy Statement if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect and (ii) supplement the
information provided by it specifically for use in the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy
Statement to include any information that shall become necessary in order to
make the statements in the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the Company
and Acquiror further agrees to cause the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement as so corrected or supplemented promptly to be filed with the SEC
and to be disseminated to the holders of the Shares and Acquiror Common Stock,
respectively (and will use its reasonable efforts to incorporate any
reasonable comments of the other party and/or its counsel prior to such filing
and dissemination), in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
Laws.

  

## Section 6.2 _Shareholder Meetings_.

  

### (a) The Company shall take all actions in accordance with
applicable Law, its constituent documents and the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange to duly call, set a record date for, give notice of, convene and hold
a special meeting of the Company's shareholders (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Company Special Meeting_ ") on a date mutually
agreed between the Company and Acquiror which date shall be as promptly as
practicable and in no event later than 45 calendar days following the date
upon which the Form S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of considering

the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to
the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement is provided to the shareholders of the
Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Special
Meeting or (ii) if as of the time for which the Company Special Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Special Meeting; _further provided_ that no adjournment may be made to
a date on or after three Business Days prior to the Outside Date.
Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Intervening Event
Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with its terms, the Company shall (x) submit this Agreement to the
shareholders of the Company as promptly as practicable for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval at the

  

  

 -59-     

  

  

Company Special Meeting and (y) not submit any Company Takeover Proposal for
approval by the shareholders of the Company.

  

### (b) At the Company Special Meeting or any postponement or
adjournment thereof, Acquiror and Acquisition Sub shall vote, or cause to be
voted, all of the Shares then beneficially owned by either of them or any of
their Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement.

  

### (c) Acquiror shall take all actions in accordance with
applicable Law, its constituent documents and the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange to duly call, set a record date for, give notice of, convene and hold
a general meeting of Acquiror's shareholders (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof, the " _Acquiror Special Meeting_ ") on a date mutually
agreed between the Company and Acquiror which date shall be as promptly as
practicable and in no event later than 45 calendar days following the date
upon which the Form S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of considering
and taking action upon the approval of the consummation of the Transactions.
Acquiror shall take all actions necessary to cause the convocation of the
Acquiror Special Meeting (the " _Convocation_ ") to be given by the Management
Board of Acquiror no later than on the fifteenth (15th) calendar day prior to
the date of the Acquiror Special Meeting. The Convocation shall specify the
subjects to be discussed at the Acquiror Special Meeting and shall be
accompanied by the Joint Proxy Statement, which shall contain all information
required to be delivered to the shareholders of Acquiror under the applicable
Laws of the Netherlands. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, Acquiror shall not adjourn or postpone the Acquiror Special
Meeting without the consent of the Company; _provided _ that without such
consent, Acquiror may adjourn or postpone the Acquiror Special Meeting after
consultation with the Company, to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Form S-4 or Joint Proxy Statement is
provided to the shareholders of Acquiror within a reasonable amount of time in
advance of the Acquiror Special Meeting; _further provided_ that no
adjournment may be made to a date on or after three Business Days prior to the

Transactions.

  

## Section 6.3 _Efforts to Obtain Approvals_.

  

### (a) Prior to the Closing, Acquiror, Acquisition Sub and the
Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and to
cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing all things necessary, proper
or advisable under any applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Transactions by the Outside Date including (i) the preparation and filing of
all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the
Transactions, (ii) the satisfaction of the conditions to consummating the
Transactions, (iii) taking all reasonable actions necessary to obtain

  

  

 -60-     

  

  

any consent, authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any
third party, including any Governmental Entity (which actions shall include
furnishing all information required by any Antitrust Authority) required to be
obtained or made by Acquiror, Acquisition Sub, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions or the taking of
any action contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) the execution and delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Additionally, each of
Acquiror, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
fulfill all conditions precedent to the Merger and shall not take any action
after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to
materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any permission,
approval or consent from any such Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained
prior to Closing. To the extent that transfers of any permits issued by any
Governmental Entity are required as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, the parties hereto shall
use reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers.

  

### (b) Acquiror and the Company shall each keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
Transactions and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining CFIUS
Approval and all required consents, authorizations, Orders or approvals of, or
any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity undertaken pursuant to the
provisions of this _Section 6.3_. In that regard, prior to the Closing, each
party shall promptly consult with the other parties hereto with respect to and
provide any necessary information with respect to (and, in the case of
correspondence, provide the other parties (or their counsel) copies of) all
filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity or any other
information supplied by such party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental
Entity in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each party
hereto shall promptly inform the other parties to this Agreement, and if in
writing, furnish the other party with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the other party orally of) any communication from any
Governmental Entity regarding this Agreement or any of the Transactions, and
permit the other party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed
communication with any such Governmental Entity. If any party to this
Agreement or any Representative of such parties receives a request for
information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect
to this Agreement or the Transactions, then such party shall make, or cause to
be made, promptly and after consultation with the other parties to this
Agreement, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. Neither
party hereto shall participate in any meeting or teleconference with any
Governmental Entity where material issues would likely be discussed in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions unless it consults with
the other party in advance and to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Entity gives the other party a reasonable opportunity to attend and
participate thereat. Each party hereto shall furnish the other party with
copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental
Entity with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, and furnish the other
party with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other
party may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary
filings or submissions of information to any such Governmental Entity;
_provided_ , _however_ , that materials provided pursuant to this _Section
6.3(b)_ may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of
the Company and the Merger or other confidential information, (ii) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to
address reasonable privilege concerns. Acquiror and the Company may each
designate certain materials provided

  

  

 -61-     

  

  

pursuant to this _Section 6.3(b)_ as outside legal counsel only as reasonably
necessary and pursuant to a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement.

  

### (c) The Company and Acquiror shall file, as promptly as
practicable, but in any event no later than fifteen Business Days after the
date of this Agreement, notifications under the HSR Act, and the Company and
Acquiror shall file, as promptly as practicable any other filings and/or
notifications under other applicable Antitrust Laws. In the event that the
parties receive a request for information or documentary material following
the HSR Act filing (a " _Second Request_ ") and/or the Transactions are
subject to "second phase" review following any filing, notice, petition,
statement, registration, submission of information, application or similar
filing required by any other Antitrust Law or by any Antitrust Authority (a "
_Second Phase Information Request_ "), the parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to respond to such Second Request and/or Second Phase
Information Request, as applicable, as promptly as possible or as otherwise
instructed by Acquiror pursuant to _Section 6.3(i)_ , and counsel for both
parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request
review process and/or Second Phase Information Request process, as the case
may be.

  

### (d) In furtherance, and not in limitation of the foregoing,
Acquiror shall take any and all action necessary to obtain expiration or early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, including but not limited
to: (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to
sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of
the Company or Acquiror or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating,
entering into or modifying existing relationships, contractual rights or
obligations of the Company or Acquiror or their respective Subsidiaries; (iii)
terminating any venture or other arrangement; (iv) creating any relationship,
contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Acquiror or their
respective Subsidiaries or (v) effectuating any other change or restructuring
of the Company or Acquiror or their respective Subsidiaries (and, in each
case, to enter into agreements or stipulate to the entry of an order or decree
or file appropriate applications with any Antitrust Authority in connection
with any of the foregoing) (each a " _Divestiture Action_ ") in an effort to
ensure that no Governmental Entity enters any order, decision, judgment,
decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any law,
rule, regulation or other action preliminarily or permanently restraining,
enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger. The Acquiror may
condition the entry of a Divestiture Action on consummation of the Merger. In
the event an Antitrust Authority institutes (or threatens to institute) any
action challenging the Transaction as violative of any U.S. Antitrust Law,
Acquiror and the Company shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to
vigorously contest and resist any such Action, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the Merger or any other
Transactions, including by pursuing administrative or judicial appeal, and
Acquiror shall take all action necessary, including but not limited to any
Divestiture Action, in an effort to resolve such action so as to permit such
consummation prior to the Outside Date. To assist Acquiror in complying with
its obligations set forth in this _Section 6.3_ , at Acquiror's request the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into one or more
agreements prior to the Closing with respect to any Divestiture Action;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the consummation of the transactions provided
for in any such agreement for a Divestiture Action shall be conditioned upon
the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this _Section 6.3_ or elsewhere shall require, or be deemed to
require, Acquiror

  

  

 -62-     

  

  

to take or agree to take any Divestiture Action if doing so would,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect or an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

  

### (e) Within one Business Day of the date of this Agreement,
Acquiror and the Company shall notify CFIUS that this Agreement has been
executed and shall request to meet informally with CFIUS within ten (10)
Business Days of the date of this Agreement. Acquiror and Company shall
submit a draft joint voluntary notice to CFIUS with regard to this Agreement
and other related information pursuant to Section 721 of the Defense
Production Act of 1950, as amended, within ten (10) Business Days of the date
of this Agreement and submit a final joint voluntary notice to CFIUS with
regard to this Agreement and other related information pursuant to Section 721
of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, within twenty (20) Business
Days of this Agreement. Each of Acquiror and the Company shall respond to any
request for information from CFIUS in the time frame set forth in the CFIUS
regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 800. Acquiror shall take, or cause to be taken,
all actions that are customarily undertaken to obtain CFIUS Approval so as to
enable the Closing by the Outside Date, including, but not limited to, (i)
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by mitigation agreement,
security control agreement, special security arrangement, voting trust
agreement or proxy agreement, restrictions or actions that after the Closing
Date would limit Acquiror's freedom of action, ownership, control, influence,
management or access over the acquired or Acquiror's businesses or any asset
and (ii) the transfer or sale of contracts or associated joint venture
interests involving access to classified information or facilities or which
are issued under programs or authorizations that do not allow participation by
non-U.S. persons. The Company shall cooperate and take reasonable best
efforts to assist Acquiror in obtaining the CFIUS Approval.

  

### (f) The Company and its Subsidiaries and Acquiror shall
cooperate to make all necessary filings and submit all necessary information
to Defense Security Service (" _DSS_ "), the DOE and, to the extent
applicable, any other United States Governmental Agency, concerning the
notification of the Transactions pursuant to the National Industrial Security
Program Operating Manual (" _NISPOM_ "), applicable DOE orders, directives and
policies and any other applicable national or industrial security regulations
or policies. For purposes of such filings and information, the Acquiror
shall, with cooperation from the Company as needed, develop, and as necessary
refine upon receiving feedback from DSS, DOE or any other United States
Governmental Agency, a mitigation proposal to address foreign ownership
control and influence (" _FOCI_ ") that is acceptable to DSS, DOE or such
other United States Governmental Agency to include in such filings and
submissions. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall cooperate with Acquiror
in requesting from DSS, DOE and any other relevant United States Governmental
Agency approval to operate the business pursuant to any FOCI mitigation
proposal submitted in relation to this Agreement or the Transactions. The
Acquiror's obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.3(f)_ shall include but not
be limited to (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
mitigation agreement, security control agreement, special security
arrangement, voting trust agreement or proxy agreement, restrictions or
actions that after executing this Agreement and after the Closing Date would
limit Acquiror's freedom of action, ownership, control, influence, management
or access over the acquired or Acquiror's businesses or any asset and (ii)
the transfer or sale of contracts involving access to classified information
or facilities or which are issued under programs or authorizations that do not
allow participation by non-U.S. persons.

  

### 

  

  

 -63-     

  

  



  

### (g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in _Sections 6.3(e)_ and _6.3(f) _ shall require, or be
deemed to require, Acquiror to take any action or agree to any term, condition
or consequence if doing so would, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or an
Acquiror Material Adverse Effect. A requirement that Acquiror take customary
mitigation steps as noted in _Sections 6.3(e)_ and _6.3(f)_ , such as
entering into a voting trust, mitigation agreement, proxy agreement, special
security agreement, or arranging for the sale or transfer of contracts or
associated joint venture interests involving classified work or access to
classified facilities or which are issued under programs or authorizations
that do not allow participation by non-U.S. persons shall not be considered a
Company Material Adverse Effect or an Acquiror Material Adverse Effect.

  

### (h) Without limiting any of the obligations of any party to
this Agreement set forth in this _Section 6.3_ , each of Acquiror and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the approval and
consent of, and the issuances of licenses and license amendments by, the
Nuclear Regulatory Agencies under the Atomic Energy Act and the applicable
laws and regulations of all Nuclear Regulatory Agencies having jurisdiction
over the Company necessary to consummate the Transactions (the " _Nuclear
Regulatory Approvals_ ").

  

### (i) The parties hereto agree that Acquiror shall be
entitled to direct the strategy for all filings, notifications, submissions
and communications in connection with any filing, notice, petition, statement,
registration, submission of information, application or similar filing subject
to this _Section 6.3_ , subject to consultation and cooperation with the
Company as provided in this _Section 6.3_.

  

## Section 6.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Subject to
applicable Law, (a) the Company shall give prompt notice to Acquiror, and
Acquiror shall give prompt notice to the Company, of the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event or circumstance whose occurrence or non-occurrence
would be reasonably likely to cause either (i) any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect
at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time or (ii) any
condition to the Merger to be unsatisfied at the Effective Time and (b) the
Company shall give prompt notice to Acquiror, and Acquiror shall give prompt
notice to the Company, of any failure of the Company, Acquiror, Acquisition
Sub or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative of the
Company, Acquiror or Acquisition Sub, as applicable, to comply with or satisfy
any covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, which failure would be reasonably likely to cause any condition to
the Merger to be unsatisfied at the Effective Time and (c) the Company shall
give prompt notice to Acquiror, and Acquiror shall give prompt notice to the
Company, of any substantive communication from any Governmental Entity
regarding any material Action commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company or
Acquiror, as applicable, threatened, with respect to the Transactions against
Acquiror, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, properties or
assets, officers, directors or employees, and each of Acquiror and the Company
shall permit the other party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in
good faith the views of the other party in connection with, and a reasonable
opportunity to participate in any proposed communication with any Governmental
Entity with respect to such an Action; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available under this Agreement to the party
receiving such notice. The Company and Acquiror

  

  

 -64-     

  

  

shall each promptly notify the other of any written notice from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Transactions. The Company and Acquiror shall each promptly notify the
other of any Actions commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its
Subsidiaries which relate to the consummation of the Transactions.

  

## Section 6.5 _Access; Confidentiality_. The Company agrees to (a)
provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, Acquiror and its
Representatives, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, reasonable access during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice from Acquiror, in such
a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of any business
conducted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) the Company's and
its Subsidiaries' respective properties, books, Contracts, commitments,
personnel and records and (ii) such other information as Acquiror shall
reasonably request with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective businesses, financial condition and operations; and (b) request its
and its Subsidiaries' respective Representatives to cooperate with Acquiror
with respect to the foregoing; _provided _ that nothing in this Agreement
shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose any
information to Acquiror or its Representatives that would cause a violation of
or otherwise contravene any material Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, would be reasonably expected to cause a loss of
privilege to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or would constitute a
violation of applicable Law; and _provided_ , _further _ that (x) no
investigation of the Company's business shall affect any representation or
warranty given by the Company hereunder, in the Company Disclosure Letter or
in the certificate referenced in _Section 7.2(c)_ , or otherwise limit or
affect the remedies available under this Agreement to Acquiror, (y)
competitively sensitive material (reasonably designated by the Company as
such) may be provided in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section
6.3(b)_ if applicable and to the extent permitted by applicable Law and (z)
Acquiror shall not be entitled to perform any invasive or destructive sampling
or testing of any kind at any location without the prior written approval of
the Company, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld by the Company.
Acquiror shall and shall cause Acquiror's controlled Affiliates and
Representatives to keep confidential any non-public information received from
the Company, its Affiliates or Representatives, directly or indirectly,

### (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to
the fullest extent permitted under the LBCL, honor the Company's obligations
existing immediately prior to the date of this Agreement to indemnify
(including any obligations to advance funds for expenses) and hold harmless
each present and former director and officer of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and each such individual who served at the request of the Company
or its Subsidiaries as a director, officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise other than the Company or
a Subsidiary thereof (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), in
accordance with the terms of the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation
and Amended and Restated By-laws, any indemnification agreements and
applicable Law, in each case in effect immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement. The articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses than are set forth in
the Restated Articles of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated By-Laws of
the Company and set forth in any indemnification agreement currently in effect
between the Company and any Indemnified Party, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would affect
adversely the rights of the Indemnified Parties thereunder.

  

### (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase a six-
year "tail" prepaid officers' and directors' liability insurance policy,
providing, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, the Company's
current and former directors and officers (as defined to mean those persons
insured under the Company's existing officers' and directors' liability
insurance policy) with insurance and indemnification policy coverage for
events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_")
that is no less favorable than the existing policy (including that such
purchase does not result in any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company shall not pay an aggregate amount for the DandO Insurance in excess
of 300 percent of the current aggregate annual premium paid by the Company for
the existing policy, but in such case shall purchase such coverage under a
six-year "tail" prepaid policy as shall then be available at an aggregate cost
no greater than 300 percent of such rate. From and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall continue to honor its obligations under the DandO
Insurance and shall not cancel nor take any action or omit to take any action
that would result in the cancellation thereof.

  

### (c) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this
_Section 6.7_ shall be in addition to any rights such individual may have
under the Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws
(or other governing documents) of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries,
under the LBCL or any other applicable Laws or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Party with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party.

  

### (d) In the event that Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and is not the

  

  

 -66-     

  

  

continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

  

## Section 6.8 _Employee Matters_.

  

### (a) From and after the Effective Time, Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) shall honor all Company
Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, it being
understood that the foregoing shall not be construed to limit the right of the
Acquiror and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to amend
any Company Plan and compensation arrangements and agreements. For a period
of six months following the Effective Time, Acquiror shall provide, or shall
cause one of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to
provide, to (i) each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Effective Time who is not subject to a collective bargaining agreement
(together, the " _Company Non-Union Employees_ "), for so long as the
applicable employee remains employed by Acquiror or one of its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) during such six-month period, base
salary or wages that are no less than those provided to such Company Non-Union
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Company Non-
Union Employees who continue employment with Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, as
a group, employee benefits (excluding incentive compensation) which, in the
aggregate, are no less favorable than the employee benefits (excluding
incentive compensation), in the aggregate, provided to the Company Non-Union
Employees, as a group, immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

### (b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and
benefit accrual (other than for purposes of retiree medical plans and for
purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plans) under
the employee benefit plans of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) providing benefits to any Company Non-Union Employees
after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), Acquiror shall, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to, credit each Company
Non-Union Employee with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Non-Union Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any corresponding employee benefit plan of the Company or its
Subsidiaries in which such Company Non-Union Employee participated or was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided _
that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would
result in a duplication of benefits or where prior service is not credited for
similarly situated employees of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries or with respect
to frozen or grandfathered plans of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries. In
addition, Acquiror shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) to, provide that: (i) each Company Non-Union Employee
shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any
and all New Plans that are welfare benefit plans to the extent such New Plan
provides benefits of the same type as a Company Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ ") other than limitations or waiting periods
that would have been in effect with respect to such Company Employee under
such Old Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) for purposes
of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits

  

  

 -67-     

  

  

to any Company Employee, Acquiror shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would
not have been waived under the corresponding Old Plan in which such employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Acquiror shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by a Company
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such employee's participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

  

### (c) Prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries,
as applicable, shall fully comply with all notice, consultation, effects
bargaining or other bargaining obligations to any labor union, labor
organization, works council or group of employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions.

  

### (d) On or before the Closing Date, the Company shall provide
a list of the name and site of employment of any and all employees of the
Company who have experienced, or will experience, an employment loss or layoff
as defined by the WARN Act or any similar applicable state or local law
requiring notice to employees in the event of a closing or layoff within
ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall update this
list up to and including the Closing Date.

  

### (e) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, to the extent required by applicable Law or the terms of
the Union Agreements (as defined below), assume responsibility for and comply
with all collective bargaining agreements, memorandums of understanding, or
other labor agreements which govern the terms and conditions of any Covered
Employees (the " _Union Agreements_ ") and will maintain the compensation and
benefits of those Covered Employees whose employment is subject to the Union
Agreements (the " _Company Union Employees_ ") to the extent required by the
terms of the Union Agreements, it being understood that this paragraph shall
not be construed as a limitation on the rights of the parties to a Union
Agreement to amend such agreement in a manner permitted by its terms.

  

### (f) Nothing in this _Section 6.8_ shall (i) be treated as
an amendment of, or undertaking to amend, any benefit plan or (ii) prohibit
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, from
amending or terminating any employee benefit plan in a manner that is not
inconsistent with this _Section 6.8_. The provisions of this _Section 6.8_
are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and
nothing in this _Section 6.8_ , express or implied, shall confer upon any
Covered Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof or other
Person, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued
employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature
or kind whatsoever under this Agreement or a right in any employee or
beneficiary of such employee or other Person under a Company Plan that such
employee or beneficiary or other Person would not otherwise have under the
terms of that Company Plan.

## Section 6.9 _Financing and Financing Cooperation_.

  

### (a) Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, advisable or proper to consummate and obtain the Financing on the
terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter or terms not less
favorable (taken as a whole) to Acquiror by the Closing, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect and comply in all material
respects with its obligations under the Commitment Letter, (ii) satisfy on a
timely basis (including using reasonable best efforts to cause the Marketing
Period to be completed prior to February 8, 2013, subject to the receipt of
the Required Information) all conditions to the funding of the Financing set
forth in the Commitment Letter or the definitive financing agreements and
(iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on
the terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter (including
after giving effect to any "market flex" provisions in connection with the
Financing), or terms and conditions not less favorable (taken as a whole) to
Acquiror. Acquiror shall keep the Company informed on a regular basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing.
Without limiting the effect of the foregoing, Acquiror shall give the Company
prompt notice of (i) any material breach or default by any other party to the
Commitment Letter of which Acquiror becomes aware, (ii) the receipt of any
written notice with respect to any actual or potential breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter or any
provision thereof or any material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Commitment Letter with respect to the obligations to fund the
Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing, and
(iii) the expiration or termination for any reason of the Commitment Letter.

  

### (b) Acquiror shall not, and shall not permit Acquisition Sub
to, agree to or permit any termination, amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification of, or waive any of its material rights under, the
Commitment Letter without the Company's prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided _ that
Acquiror and Acquisition Sub may, without the Company's prior written consent
(x) enter into any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to
or waiver of any provision of the Commitment Letter that does not contain any
provisions that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the consummation of the Financing or the Transactions; and
(y) amend the Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, book runners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Commitment
Letter as of the date of this Agreement so long as any such addition would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the Financing or the Transactions. For the avoidance of
doubt, each of Acquiror or Acquisition Sub may, if it so determines in its
discretion, arrange for alternative financing for the Transactions from a
third party or parties (and thereafter the "Commitment Letter" and "Financing"
as defined herein shall refer to such financing commitment) on terms and
conditions not less favorable to the Acquiror (taken as a whole), if such
alternative financing does not contain any provisions that would reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of
the Transactions.

  

### (c) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the
Commitment Letter (including after giving effect to any "market flex"
provisions in connection with the Financing) for any reason,

  

  

 -69-     

  

  

Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain
alternative financing from the same or alternative sources (the " _Alternative
Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient and on terms and conditions not less
favorable (taken as a whole) than those described in the Commitment Letter to
enable Acquiror to fund the payment of the cash component of the aggregate
Merger Consideration. If an Alternative Financing is required in accordance
with this _Section 6.9(c)_, Acquiror shall provide the Company with a copy of
any new financing commitment (redacted for confidential terms) that provides
for such Alternative Financing, and thereafter the "Commitment Letter" as
defined herein shall refer to such financing commitment in respect of the
Alternative Financing.

  

### (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, at the
sole expense of Acquiror, provide such reasonable cooperation in connection
with any financing by Acquiror or any of its Affiliates in connection with the
Transactions as may be reasonably requested by Acquiror or its
Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives to, use their reasonable best efforts upon request of Acquiror
to on a timely basis (taking into account the expected timing of the
commencement of the Marketing Period) (i) furnish the report of the Company's
auditor on the most recently available audited consolidated financial
statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries and use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain the consent of such auditor to the use of such report in
accordance with normal custom and practice and use reasonable best efforts to
cause such auditor to provide customary comfort letters to the underwriters,
initial purchasers or placement agents, as applicable, in connection with any
such financing; (ii) furnish any financial statements, schedules or other
financial data or information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
reasonably requested by Acquiror or its Representatives as may be reasonably

registered public offering, to consummate the offering(s) of debt securities
and convertible debt contemplated by the Commitment Letter, or as otherwise
reasonably required in connection with the Financing or Alternative Financing
and the Transactions or as otherwise necessary in order to assist in receiving

accountants in connection with the offering(s) of debt securities contemplated
by the Commitment Letter (all such information in these clauses (i) and
(ii),the " _Required Information_ ); (iii) facilitate contact between (x)
senior management and advisors, including auditors, of the Company and (y) the

necessary or desirable to permit Acquiror or any of its Affiliates to fulfill
conditions or obligations under the financing documents; (vii) provide
reasonable assistance in the preparation of one or more confidential
information memoranda, prospectuses, offering memoranda and other marketing

Affiliates; (viii) use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Acquiror in
ensuring that the syndication efforts benefit from the existing banking
relationships of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ix) permit the reasonable
use by Acquiror and its Affiliates of the Company's and its Subsidiaries'
logos for syndication and underwriting, as applicable, of financing (subject
to advance review of and consultation with respect to such use); (x)
reasonably participate as necessary in meetings, presentations and road shows
with prospective lenders and investors and in drafting sessions and due
diligence sessions, as applicable (including the reasonable participation in

and perfection of security interests in share certificates, securities and
other collateral, and obtaining surveys and title insurance as reasonably
requested by Acquiror; and (xiv) not commence or effect any offering,
placement or arrangement of any debt securities or bank financing competing
with the proposed financing of Acquiror and its Affiliates (and not permit any
such offering, placement or arrangements to occur on its behalf); _provided _
that (x) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
pay any commitment or other fee or incur any other liability or obligation in
connection with the Financing or any Alternative Financing or to take any
action that would be prohibited by any applicable Law or cause a default of,
or breach under, or otherwise violate any Material Contract, in each case
except for any payment, incurrence or action that is conditioned upon, and
shall not take effect until, the Effective Time, and (y) no obligations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any certificate, document or
instrument delivered pursuant to this _Section 6.9(d)_ shall be effective
until the Effective Time. All material non-public information regarding the

parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and
its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Federal Court sitting in

jurisdiction, the Delaware Court of Chancery, and any appellate court from any
thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby for any reason other than the
failure to serve process in accordance with this _Section 9.10_ , and
irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or an improper venue to
the maintenance of any such action or proceeding. Any service of process to
be made in such action or proceeding may be made by delivery of process in
accordance with the notice provisions contained in _Section 9.4_. The
consents to jurisdiction set forth in this _Section 9.10_ shall not constitute
general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have

parties hereto agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal

Transactions) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the parties
shall be entitled to seek an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate
remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

expected to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived and
(ii) the full proceeds to be provided to Acquiror by the Financing or
Alternative Financing shall be available to Acquiror to complete the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is agreed that the Company shall be entitled
to enforce specifically Acquiror's and Acquisition Sub's obligation to draw
upon the Financing or Alternative Financing if and only if the Company has
Unrestricted Cash of at least $800,000,000 and all of the other conditions set
forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ (other than any condition that by its
nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing but that is expected
