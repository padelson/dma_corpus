ARTICLE II

THE OFFER

2.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Terms of Offer; Conditions to Offer_. _Provided_ that (x) this Agreement
shall not have been terminated pursuant to  _Article IX_ and (y) none of the
events set forth in clause (C)(5) of _Annex A_ hereto shall have occurred or
exist, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer to
purchase all of the Company Shares at a price per Company Share, subject to
the terms of _Section 2.1(b)_ and this sentence, equal to the Offer Price as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof (but in no event more than 10
Business Days thereafter). The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment
and to pay for any Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn (and the
obligation of Parent to cause Merger Sub to accept for payment and to pay for
any Company Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn) shall be subject only
to:

(i) the condition (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") that, at the then scheduled
expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended from time to time pursuant to
_Section 2.1(c)_), there have been validly tendered in accordance with the
terms of the Offer and not withdrawn a number of Company Shares that,
together with the Company Shares then owned by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub (if any), represents at least a majority of
the sum of (x) all then outstanding Company Shares, _plus_ (y) all Company
Shares issuable upon the exercise of all then outstanding Company Options,
_plus_ (z) all Company Shares issuable upon

 



-13-   the exercise, conversion or exchange of any then outstanding Company
Securities (other than Company Options), in each case, without regard to the
exercise or conversion price, vesting schedule or other terms and conditions
thereof, and

(ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent and Merger Sub, of the other
conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto (together with the Minimum
Condition, the " _Offer Conditions_ ").

Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to increase the Offer Price
or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer;
_provided, however_ , that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or
previously approved by the Company in writing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub
may make any change to the terms and conditions of the Offer that:



     | (A) | decreases the Offer Price or changes the form of
consideration to be paid in the Offer, 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (B) | reduces the number of Company Shares sought to be purchased
in the Offer or amends or waives the Minimum Condition, 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (C) | amends or modifies any of the conditions to the Offer set
forth in _Annex A_ hereto in a manner that is adverse to the Company
Stockholders,  
---|---|--- 



     | (D) | imposes conditions to the Offer that are in addition to the
conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ hereto, 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (E) | extends that Offer, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, or 
---|---|--- 



     | (F) | otherwise modifies or amends any of the material terms of
the Offer in a manner that is adverse to the Company Stockholders. 
---|---|--- 
 

Subject to this _Section 2.1(a)_, the Offer Conditions hereto are for the
sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be waived by Parent and Merger
Sub, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, in their sole
discretion, other than the Minimum Condition and the Regulatory Condition,
which may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub only with the prior written
consent of the Company. The failure by Parent and Merger Sub at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right, and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time prior to the Acceptance Time.

(b) _Adjustments to Offer Price_. The Offer Price shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Shares), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Shares occurring on or after the date
hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time.

(c) _Extension and Expiration of Offer_. Unless extended in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Offer, the Offer shall
expire at midnight, Eastern time, on the date that is 20 business days (for
this purpose calculated in accordance with Section 14d-1(g)(3) under the
Exchange Act) after the date the Offer is commenced (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act); _provided, however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement:

(i) Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff or Nasdaq that
is applicable to the Offer;

 



-14-  (ii) in the event that any of the Offer Conditions (other than the Minimum
Condition) are not satisfied or waived as of any then scheduled expiration of
the Offer, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for 1 or more successive
extension periods of up to 10 Business Days each in order to permit the
satisfaction of the Offer Conditions; and 

(iii) in the event that the Minimum Condition is not satisfied or waived as of
any then scheduled expiration of the Offer, but all of the other conditions
have been satisfied or waived at such time, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer
for up to 3 successive extension periods of 10 Business Days each in order to
permit the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition, and after such 3 required
extension periods have expired, Merger Sub may (but shall not be required to)
extend the Offer for additional extension periods of 10 Business Days each in
order to permit the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition;

 

 _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i) - (iii)
of this _Section 2.1(c)_, inclusive, in no event shall Merger Sub be
required to extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date; and _provided
further_ , that the foregoing clauses (i) - (iii) of this _Section 2.1(c)_,
inclusive, shall not be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in
any manner the right of Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
terms of _Article IX_ hereof. Merger Sub shall not (and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub not to) terminate the Offer prior to any applicable expiration of
the Offer, except if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article IX_.
If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article IX_, Merger Sub shall
(and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly (and in any event within
seventy-two (72) hours of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or
this Agreement is terminated prior to the purchase of Company Shares in the
Offer, Merger Sub shall not (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub not to) accept
any Company Shares pursuant to the Offer, and Merger Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly return, and shall cause any depositary
acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, in accordance with applicable Law,
all tendered Company Shares to the holders thereof.

(d) _Payment for Company Shares_. On the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement and the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company Shares validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, promptly after the
applicable expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with
_Section 2.1(c)_). Parent shall provide to Merger Sub funds in an amount
sufficient to pay for all such Company Shares in accordance with
this Agreement. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Company Share
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid without
interest, net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction only for any
applicable U.S. federal income Tax withholding, back-up withholding or other
applicable Tax withholdings.

(e) _Subsequent Offering Period_. After the Acceptance Time, if necessary to
reach the Short-Form Threshold (assuming full exercise of the Top-Up Option),
Merger Sub may (but shall not be required to), and the Offer Documents shall
reserve the right to, extend the Offer for a subsequent offering period (and
one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with

 



-15-   Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act of not less than 3 or more than 20
business days (for this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
promulgated under the Exchange Act). Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Offer, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to) immediately accept for payment, and promptly pay for, all Company
Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer during such subsequent offering
period. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Company Share validly
tendered in such subsequent offering period shall be paid without interest,
net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to reduction only for any
applicable U.S. federal income Tax withholding, back-up withholding or other
applicable Tax withholdings.

(f) _Schedule TO; Offer Documents_. As soon as practicable on the date the
Offer is commenced (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act),
Parent and Merger Sub shall:

(i) prepare and file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") with respect to the Offer, which
shall contain as an exhibit or incorporate by reference an offer to purchase

thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "); and

 

(ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to all holders of Company
Shares (collectively, the " _Company Stockholders_ ").

Subject to the provisions of _Section 7.2_, the Schedule TO and the Offer

Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub in writing all
information concerning the Company that may be required by applicable
securities laws or reasonably requested by Parent and Merger Sub for inclusion
in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall promptly correct or
supplement any information provided by it for use in the Schedule TO or the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect. Parent and Merger Sub shall
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, as
so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and the other Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable
consideration to any such comments. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the
Company and its counsel with reasonable prior notice of, and an opportunity to
participate in, any telephone calls or in-person meetings that Parent, Merger
Sub or their counsel schedules or arranges with the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Sub
shall provide to the Company and its counsel any and all written comments,
and shall inform the Company and its counsel of any oral comments, that
Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with

at a price and on terms that are fair to, and in the best interests of the
Company and the Company Stockholders,

(iii) unanimously approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, which approval, to the extent

be subject to the provisions of, or any restrictions under, the provisions of
Section 203 of the DGCL; and

 

(iv) unanimously resolved to recommend that the Company Stockholders accept

-18-  2.3 _Company Boards of Directors and Committees; Section 14(f) of Exchange
Act_ .

(a) _Composition of Company Board_. Effective upon the initial acceptance for
payment by Merger Sub of Company Shares pursuant to the Offer (the "
_Acceptance Time_ "), and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be
entitled to designate up to such number of directors on the Company Board
equal to the product (rounded up to the next whole number) obtained by
multiplying (x) the total number of directors on the Company Board (after
giving effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this
_Section 2.3_) by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
Company Shares beneficially owned by Parent and Merger Sub (after giving
effect to the Company Shares purchased pursuant to the Offer) and the
denominator of which is the total number of then outstanding Company Shares.
Promptly following a request by Parent after the Acceptance Time, the Company
shall take all action reasonably necessary to cause the individuals so
designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the Company Board,
including (at the election of Parent) either by increasing the size of the
Company Board or by seeking and accepting the resignations of such number of
then incumbent directors as is necessary to enable the individuals so
designated by Parent to be elected or appointed to the Company Board
(the time that Parents designees are appointed or elected to, and constitute
a majority of, the Company Board, the " _Appointment Time_ "). From time to
time after the Appointment Time, the Company shall take all action necessary
to cause the individuals so designated by Parent to constitute substantially
the same percentage (rounding up where appropriate) as is on the Company Board
on: (i) each committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board of directors of
each Subsidiary of the Company, and (iii) each committee of each such board
of directors of each Subsidiary of the Company, in each case to the fullest
extent permitted by all Laws, and specifically including the applicable rules
of Nasdaq (the " _Nasdaq Rules_ "). Promptly following a request by Parent
after the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to
elect to be treated as a "controlled company" as defined by Nasdaq Rule
5615(c) and make all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such
status. After the Appointment Time, and prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause the Company Board to maintain at least 3 directors who are
members of the Company Board immediately prior to such appointments by Parent
(collectively, the " _Continuing Directors_ " and each as a " _Continuing
Director_ "); _provided, however_ , that if the number of Continuing Directors
is reduced below 3 for any reason, the remaining Continuing Directors shall
be entitled to elect or designate a person meeting the foregoing criteria to
fill such vacancy who shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes
of this Agreement, or, if no Continuing Directors then remain, the other
directors shall designate 3 persons meeting the foregoing criteria to fill
such vacancies, and such persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors
for purposes of this Agreement. Each Continuing Director shall be an
"independent director" as defined by Nasdaq Rule 5605 and eligible to serve on
the Companys audit committee under the Exchange Act and the Nasdaq Rules and
at least 1 Continuing Director shall be an "audit committee financial expert"
as defined in Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto.

(b)  _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligation to
appoint Parents designees to the Company Board shall be subject to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The
Company shall promptly take all action required pursuant to this _Section
2.3_ and Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations
under this _Section 2.3_, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9
such information with respect to the Company and its directors and officers
as is required under such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this _Section 2.3_. Parent shall provide to the Company
in writing, and be solely responsible for, any information with respect to
itself and its nominees, directors, officers and affiliates, required by such
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

 



-19-  (c) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, from the Appointment Time through
the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors (or
the sole Continuing Director if there shall be only 1 Continuing Director)
shall be required in order to:

(i) amend or terminate this Agreement, or agree or consent to any amendment or
termination of this Agreement, in any case on behalf of the Company,

(ii) extend the time for performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or
other acts of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement,

(iii) waive any of the Companys rights under this Agreement, or 

(iv) make any other determination with respect to any action to be taken or
not to be taken by or on behalf of the Company relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger.

The Continuing Directors shall have, and Parent and the Company Board shall
take all necessary action to cause the Continuing Directors to have, the
authority to retain counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company
or the Company Board) at the expense of the Company for the purpose of
fulfilling their obligations hereunder, and the authority to institute any
lawsuit or action on behalf of the Company and the Company Board to enforce
performance of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. 

2.4 _Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer Price
the number of Company Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the
lowest number of Company Shares that, when added to the number of Company
Shares owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries at the time of such exercise,
shall constitute one (1) share more than 90% of the Company Shares then
outstanding (the " _Short Form Threshold_ ") (after giving effect to the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares); _provided, however_ , that (x) the
Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless, immediately after such exercise
and the issuance of Company Shares pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold
would be reached (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares); and (y)
in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of Company
Shares in excess of the Companys total authorized and unissued Company Shares
(treating any Company Shares held in the treasury of the Company
as unissued).

(b) Merger Sub may pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for
the Top-Up Option Shares either (i) entirely in cash or (ii) at Merger Subs
election, by (x) paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate
par value of the Top-Up Option Shares and (y) executing and delivering to the
Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance of
the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount
paid in cash pursuant to the preceding clause (x) (a " _Promissory Note_ ").
Any such Promissory Note shall be full recourse against Parent and Merger Sub
and (i) shall bear simple interest at a rate of 3% per annum, (ii) shall
mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
Promissory Note, (iii) may be prepaid at any time, in whole or in part,
without premium or penalty and (iv) shall have no other material terms.

 



-20-  (c) _Provided_ that no Law or Order shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or
otherwise make such exercise or issuance illegal, (i) Merger Sub may exercise
the Top-Up Option, in whole but not in part, at any one time after the
Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to occur of (x) the Effective Time
and (y) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ hereof and
(ii) at the Companys request, Merger Sub shall exercise the Top-Up Option, in
whole but not in part, at such place, time and date specified by the Company
after the Acceptance Time and prior to the earliest to occur of (x) the
Effective Time and (y) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article
IX_ hereof if, immediately after such exercise and the issuance of Company
Shares pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold would be reached (assuming
the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares).

 

(d) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Parent or
Merger Sub shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise
Notice_ ") specifying the denominations of the certificate or certificates
evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares which such party wishes to receive, and
the place, time and date for the closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to
the Top-Up Option (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly
after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to
Parent and Merger Sub confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and
the aggregate purchase price therefore (the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At
the Top-Up Closing, Merger Sub shall pay the Company the aggregate price
required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares, by delivery of cash and, if
applicable, a Promissory Note in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
amount specified in the Top-Up Notice Receipt, and the Company shall cause to
be issued and delivered to Merger Sub a Certificate or Certificates
representing the Top-Up Option Shares or, if the Company does not then have
certificated shares, the applicable number of Book-Entry Shares. Such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may include any legends that are required by
federal or state securities laws.

 

(e) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be
registered under the Securities Act and shall be issued in reliance upon an
exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Parent and Merger Sub
represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or shall be upon any
purchase of Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in
Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the
Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of
the Top-Up Option, if any, are being and shall be acquired by Merger Sub for
the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

 

(f) Any dilutive impact on the value of the Company Shares as a result of the
issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares will not be taken into account in any
determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 3.7(c)_.

the handling of the ESPP as required pursuant to _Section 3.8(c)_.

 

3.9 _Exchange for Merger Consideration_.

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

Days) following the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the

which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company
Shares (other than Dissenting Company Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in

 



25  customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Payment Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article III_. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Payment Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_,
and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. The Payment
Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such reasonable
terms and conditions as the Payment Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. Promptly
following the Effective Time, to the extent consistent with the Paying
Agents standard procedures, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to issue and
deliver the Merger Consideration to holders of uncertificated Company Shares
represented by book-entry (the " _Book-Entry Shares_ ") (either directly or
through the Depository Trust Company), without each holder of Book-Entry
Shares being required to deliver a Certificate or any executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith
be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders
of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable
to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee
if the Certificate representing such Company Shares is presented to the
Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer or similar
Taxes have been paid. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates shall be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article III_.

(d) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Merger Sub, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom under U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S.
Tax Law. To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

(f) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Shares on the date
that is 6 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent (or
its designee) upon demand, and any Company Stockholders that have not
theretofore complied with the provisions of this _Section 3.9_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon.

3.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. From and after the
Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled,

 



26  extinguished and cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share theretofore representing any Company Shares (other than Dissenting
Company Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor upon the
surrender or transfer thereof in accordance with the provisions of _Section
3.9_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
_Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Company Shares. From and after the close of business
on the Closing Date, there shall be no further registration of transfers on
the records of the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers
to reflect, in accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades
effected prior to the close of business on the Closing Date. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this  _Article III_.

3.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 3.7_;
_provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

3.12 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation shall take all such lawful and necessary
action on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub.

ARTICLE IV

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

Except, with respect to any Section of this _Article IV_, as set forth in the
SEC Reports (excluding any disclosures contained under the heading "Risk
Factors" or in any section relating to "forward-looking statements" to the
extent that they are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature)
filed by the Company after December 31, 2009 but prior to the date hereof, or
in the section of the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent
on the date of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") that
corresponds to such Section or in another section of the Company Disclosure
Schedule to the extent it is reasonably apparent from the text of such
disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to such other Section, the
Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

4.1 _Organization and Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under Delaware Law. Each of the
Companys Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good

Subsidiaries has the requisite power and authority to carry on its respective
business as it is presently being conducted and to own, lease or

 



27  operate its respective properties and assets. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the
nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent the
"good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside
the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent true,
correct and complete copies of (x) the certificates of incorporation and
bylaws or other constituent documents, as amended to date, of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and (y) the minutes of all material meetings, and any
material action taken by written consent, of the Company Stockholders,
the Company Board and each committee of the Company Board occurring at any
time since December 31, 2009, subject to redactions, in a manner that is
readily apparent to Parent, of portions of such minutes and actions by written
consent related to attorney-client privileged information, competitively
sensitive information and other information regarding potential strategic
alternatives considered by the Company reasonably determined by the Company
not to be appropriate to disclose in the context of negotiation of a
definitive acquisition agreement. Neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of its certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other applicable constituent documents. 

4.2 _Subsidiaries_.

interest in, each Subsidiary of the Company (i) has been duly authorized,
validly issued and is fully paid and nonassessable and (ii) is owned, directly
or indirectly, by the Company or its Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens
other than Permitted Encumbrances.

 

(c) There are no outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of,
or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii)
options, warrants, rights or other commitments or agreements to acquire from
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or that obligate the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting
interest in, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the
Company, (iii) obligations of the Company to grant, extend or enter into any
subscription, warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable security or other
similar agreement or commitment relating to any capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interest (including any voting debt) in, any Subsidiary of
the Company (the items in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), together with the
capital stock of the Subsidiaries of the Company, being referred to
collectively as " _Subsidiary Securities_ ") or (iv) other obligations by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the price or
value of any Subsidiary Securities. There are no Contracts of any kind that
obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or

only vote of the holders of any class or series of the Company Capital Stock
necessary (under Law or otherwise) to adopt this Agreement and approve the
Merger (the " _Requisite Stockholder Approval_ ").

similar Law are not applicable to this Agreement and the transactions

contemplated thereby. To the Knowledge of the Company, no other state takeover

in the imposition of a penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or

Company has heretofore made available to Parent true, correct and complete
copies of all Leases (including all modifications, amendments, supplements,

estoppel certificates, and subordination agreements relating thereto). Each

default under, or has received written notice of any breach of or default
under, any Lease, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has
occurred that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a

Subsidiaries owes brokerage commissions or finders fees with respect to any
Leased Real Property, nor would the Company or any of its Subsidiaries owe any
such fees if any existing Lease were renewed pursuant to any renewal options
contained in such Lease. Except as otherwise described in  _Section 4.18(b)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and its Subsidiaries currently
occupy all of the Leased Real Property for the operation of their business.
The Company has not transferred or assigned any interest in any Lease, nor
has the Company subleased or otherwise granted rights of use or occupancy of
any of the premises described therein to any other person or entity.

threatened condemnation or similar proceeding affecting any Leased Real
Property or any portion thereof, and the Company has no Knowledge that any
such action is currently contemplated. There are no legal actions, suits or
other legal or administrative proceedings pending against the Company or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company affecting or with
respect to any Leased Real Property.

fixtures and other tangible property and assets owned, leased or used by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Assets_ ") are sufficient and
adequate to carry on their respective businesses in all material respects as
presently conducted. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in possession of and
have good title to, or valid leasehold interests in or valid rights under
contract to use, such Assets, free and clear of all Liens, other than

any of its Subsidiaries has reasonably determined in the ordinary course
of business to abandon or not maintain, each item of Company Registered
Intellectual Property has not expired, been cancelled, or abandoned, and the
registration thereof remains in effect with the applicable Governmental

Property before such applicable Governmental Authority.

 

(c) All Company Intellectual Property owned by the Company or its Subsidiaries
is free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Encumbrances. To the
Knowledge of the Company, all other Company Intellectual Property is free and
clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Encumbrances.

 



-45-  (d) Except as set forth in _Section 4.20(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, to the Knowledge of the Company, neither the existing Company

Property Rights of any third party, or have violated, or, with respect to
Future Company Products, upon the release or sale thereof, will violate, any
intangible, proprietary right of any person (including any right to privacy or

Intellectual Property Rights of any third party, violates the intangible,
proprietary rights of any third party (including any right to privacy or
publicity), or constitutes unfair competition or trade practices under the
applicable Law.

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, no person is
misappropriating, infringing, diluting or violating any Company Intellectual
Property. None of the Company or its Subsidiaries has brought any claims,

Secrets and the Trade Secrets provided to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any other person to the extent the Company or its Subsidiaries

information and confidentiality agreement substantially in the form(s)
provided to or made available to Parent for review.

Subsidiaries, other than any licenses for commercial, off-the-shelf software
that are not incorporated into or distributed with any Company Products and

in aggregate (" _In-Licenses_ "); _provided, however,_ that with respect to
any In-Licenses entered into prior to the Companys or its Subsidiaries
acquisition of the applicable licensor, grantor or service provider

Subsidiaries with respect to Intellectual Property Rights or related services

_IP Contracts_ "); _provided, however,_ that with respect to any Out-Licenses
entered into prior to the Companys or its Subsidiaries acquisition of the
applicable licensee, grantee or service recipient thereunder or the business
of such licensee, grantee or service recipient thereunder, such
representation shall be made solely to the Knowledge of the Company.

(i) Except as set forth in _Section 4.20(i)_ of the Company Disclosure

any such rights.

relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford any Person
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or knowingly take any other action with the intent
to encourage, assist or facilitate an Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or
the making of a proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an

rights under any "standstill" or other similar agreement between the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and any Person (other than Parent), (iv) enter into

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Sections 7.1(a)_
and _7.1(b)_ , prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may, directly
or indirectly through advisors, agents or other intermediaries, subject to the
Companys compliance with the provisions of this _Section 7.1(c)_, (i) engage
or participate in discussions or negotiations with any Person that has made
(and not withdrawn) a _bona fide,_ written Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with its independent
financial advisor and its outside legal counsel) constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) furnish to any
Person that has made (and not withdrawn) a _bona fide,_ written Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good faith (after consultation
with its independent financial advisor and its outside legal counsel)
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal any
non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement the terms of which are no less
favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(which confidentiality agreement shall not include any provisions that would
prevent or restrict the Company or the Company Representatives from providing
any information to Parent to which Parent would be entitled under any
provision of this Agreement); _provided, however_ , that in the case of any
action taken pursuant to the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii), (1) none of the

to such Person, the Company furnishes such non-public information to Parent
(to the extent such information has not been previously furnished by the
Company to Parent). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company acknowledge and hereby agree that any breach of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 7.1_ by any Company Representative
shall constitute a breach of this _Section 7.1_ by the
Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in _Section
7.1(b)_, the Company Board may terminate, amend, waive or fail to enforce any
rights under any "standstill" or other 

 



-56-   similar agreement between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
Person if, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the Company
Board determines that the failure to so terminate, amend, waive or fail to
enforce such rights would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the
Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware
Law.

 

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
7.1(c)_, the Company shall promptly _,_ and in all cases within 24 hours of
its receipt, advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) any request for information that would reasonably be expected
to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction or (iii) any
inquiry with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, in each case, including the
terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Transaction, request or inquiry (unless such Acquisition Proposal is in
written form, in which case the Company shall give Parent a copy thereof), and
the identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent promptly and reasonably
informed of the status, details, terms and conditions (including all material
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request
or inquiry.

Parent to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents.

(b) Subject to the permitted actions contemplated by this _Section 7.2_ or
_Section 9.1(d)(ii)_, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof
shall (i) fail to make, withhold or withdraw, or amend, qualify or modify in
a manner adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to refuse to so make,
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board
Recommendation, (ii) approve, endorse or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, or
fail to publicly recommend against any such Acquisition Proposal that is a
tender offer or exchange offer for Company Shares within 10 Business Days
after commencement of such offer (and at all times thereafter during which any
such tender offer or exchange offer is pending) and reaffirm the Company
Board Recommendation within such 10 Business Day-period (and at all times
thereafter during which any such tender offer or exchange offer is pending),
(iii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9
or the Proxy Statement, as applicable, (iv) fail to reaffirm the Company Board
Recommendation within 3 Business Days of a written request to do so by Parent,
or (v) resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any of the foregoing
actions (any action described in clauses (i) through (v), a " _Company Board
Recommendation Change_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ to the
contrary, the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change,
or may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_ to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, if (i) the Company Board has received a _bona
fide,_ written Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal,
(ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has breached the
provisions of _Section 7.1_ or this _Section 7.2_ with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) prior to effecting such Company Board
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section
9.2(d)(ii)_, the Company Board shall have given Parent at least 3 Business
Days prior written notice thereof, 

 



-57-   which notice shall attach such Superior Proposal and set forth the identity
of the Person making such Superior Proposal and all the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal in reasonable detail (it being
understood and agreed that any revision or modification in any material
respect to such Superior Proposal shall require a new written notice by the
Company to Parent in compliance with this clause (iii) and a new matching
period under clause (iv) below, except that such notices and matching period
shall be 2 Business Days), and the opportunity to meet with the Company Board
and its outside legal counsel, all with the purpose and intent of
enabling Parent and the Company to discuss in good faith a modification of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by Parent so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be effected and (iv) Parent shall not
have made, within 3 Business Days after receipt of the Companys written
notice of its intention to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.2(d)(ii)_, a definitive
written counter-offer or proposal that the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with its independent financial advisor and its
outside legal counsel) is at least as favorable to the Company Stockholders as
such Superior Proposal. The Company shall keep confidential any such counter-
offers or proposals made by Parent to revise the terms of this Agreement,
other than in the event of any amendment to this Agreement and to the extent
required to be disclosed in any SEC Reports.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.2_ to the
contrary, the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
at any time prior to the Acceptance Time in response to an Intervening Event,
if (i) the Company Board has determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel), that, in light of such Intervening Event, the Company
Board is required to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in order to
comply with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders
under Delaware Law, and (ii) prior to effecting such Company Board
Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall have given Parent at least 3
Business Days prior written notice thereof, which notice shall describe the
Intervening Event in reasonable detail, and the opportunity to meet with
the Company Board and its outside legal counsel, all with the purpose and
intent of enabling Parent and the Company to discuss in good faith any
modification of the terms and conditions of this Agreement that may be
proposed by Parent so that the Company Board may determine not to effect such
Company Board Recommendation Change.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from (i)
complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders), _provided_ that any such disclosure (other than a "stop-look-
and-listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated
by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) following the commencement (within
the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of a tender
offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal by a third party that does not
recommend that the Company Stockholders reject such Acquisition Proposal,
shall be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change unless the Company
Board otherwise expressly publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation
within 3 Business Days following a written request by Parent, or (ii) making
any "stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act.

 

7.3 _Company Stockholder Meeting; Proxy Statement_.

(a) If approval of the Company Stockholders is required under Delaware Law in
order to consummate the Merger other than pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL,
(i) the 

 



-58-   Company shall establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and
hold a meeting of the Company Stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders 

voting upon the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law and
(ii) the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare following the Acceptance
Time, and the Company shall file with the SEC, the Proxy Statement for use in

Company or Parent as the other party hereto may reasonably request in
connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy
Statement. Subject to all applicable Law, the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as practicable following
the filing thereof with the SEC. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to,
or correspondence with the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement shall be made by the Company without providing Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon. The Company shall advise Parent,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC or its
staff for an amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement, or comments
thereon and responses thereto, or requests by the SEC or its staff for
additional information in connection therewith. If at any time prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating to the Company or
Parent, or any of their respective directors, officers or Affiliates, should
be discovered by the Company or Parent, which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party or parties
hereto, as the case may be, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement describing such information shall be promptly prepared and
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated
to the Company Stockholders.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall vote all Company Shares acquired in
the Offer (or otherwise beneficially owned by it or any of its respective
Subsidiaries as of the applicable record date) in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement in accordance with Delaware Law at the Company Stockholders
Meeting or otherwise.

 

(c) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to _Article IX_,
subject to the terms of _Sections 7.2(b)_,  _7.2(c)_ and _7.2(d)_ , the
Company shall include in the Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation
(other than with respect to the Offer).

7.4 _Short-Form Merger_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 7.3_, in
the event that Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent shall
acquire a number of Company Shares equal to at least the Short Form
Threshold, whether pursuant to the Offer upon the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or otherwise, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall take all
necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as
soon as practicable after such acquisition, without the Company Stockholders

-59-   other party or parties hereto in doing, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger), including using commercially reasonable
efforts to: (i) cause the conditions to the Offer set forth on _Annex A_
hereto and the conditions to the Merger set forth in  _Article VIII_ hereof
to be satisfied or fulfilled; (ii) obtain all necessary or appropriate
consents, waivers and approvals under any Contracts to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger) so as to maintain and preserve the benefits under such Contracts
following the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Offer and the Merger); _provided_ , that any action taken by the Company
as permitted by, and pursuant to, _Section 6.2_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shall not be a violation of this _Section 7.5(a)(ii)_; (iii) obtain
all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, Orders and
authorizations from Governmental Authorities and the expiration or termination
of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and (iv) execute or
deliver any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this
Agreement. With respect to clause (ii) above, (A) all fees, costs and expenses
to obtain, and satisfy the conditions of the consents to be obtained by the
Company hereunder (including, without limitation, the consents of all lessors
of Leased Real Property) shall be paid and borne entirely by the Company, and
(B) if the lessor, master lessor, sublessor, or licensor under any Lease

"recapture" or other termination right) upon, or otherwise requires in
response to a notice or consent request regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the payment of a consent fee, "profit sharing"
payment or other consideration (including increased rent payments), or the
provision of additional security (including a guaranty), the Company shall be
solely responsible for making all such payments and providing all such
additional security, subject to Parents approval (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) with respect to any such payments in excess of $50,000
and any such additional security; _provided, however_ , that the payment of
any such fees, costs or expenses shall not be required to be made by the
Company prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section

Parent and the Company shall file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of
the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) as
required by the HSR Act. Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly (i)
cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of such filings, (ii)
supply the other with any information that may be required in order to
effectuate such filings, and (iii) supply any additional information that
reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition
or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction or that Parent or the
Company otherwise reasonably deems necessary and/or appropriate. Each party
hereto shall promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case
may be, of any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger). If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger), then such party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. Neither Parent nor the
Company shall commit or agree (or permit their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to commit or agree) with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll
or

 



-60-   extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable
Antitrust Laws, without the prior written consent of the other party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section
7.5(a)_, in the event that any state anti-takeover or other similar statute
or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), the Company, at the direction of the Company Board, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute
or regulation on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger).

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of _Section
7.5(a)_, from the date of this Agreement until the Acceptance Time, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other party or parties hereto in doing, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to cause the eScription
Transition Condition to be satisfied as promptly as practicable after the date
of this Agreement, including the actions required to be taken pursuant to that
certain Application Service Provider Agreement, dated the date hereof by and
between Parent and the Company.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to,
and the Company may not, in order to satisfy the Regulatory Condition or
comply with any requirements under the HSR Act or any other applicable
Antitrust Laws, without the prior written consent of Parent, consent to, or
offer or agree to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding,
agreement or order to (i) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of the
business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any

business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ that, if requested by Parent, the
Company will consent to, or offer or agree to, any such requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long as such
requirement, condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order is only
binding on the Company in the event the Effective Time
occurs. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to file or defend any lawsuit or Legal Proceeding, appeal any
judgment or Order or contest any injunction in a Legal Proceeding initiated

information concerning the Leased Real Property, the Assets and the businesses
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including the status of product
development efforts, properties, results of operations and personnel of the
Company, as Parent may reasonably request; _provided, however_ , that no

foregoing, the Company shall not be required to provide Parent or any of its
accountants, legal counsel or other representatives with access to such
properties, books and records or personnel of the Company to the extent that
the provision of such access could reasonably be expected to (A) result in the
waiver of an attorney-client or other privilege, (B) result in the
unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of any of the Companys Trade
Secrets or (C) result in a breach of the Companys non-disclosure obligations,
whether by Contract or otherwise, to another Person.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and its agents,
contractors and representatives shall not have the right of entering upon
Leased Real Property for purposes of making any inspections, evaluations,

representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement has become
untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of the Company to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement, in each case, to the extent such inaccuracy or
failure would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of the
applicable Offer Condition set forth in Annex A hereto to be satisfied, (ii)
upon receiving any notice or other written communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, or (iii) upon receiving any notice or other written
communication that any Legal Proceedings have commenced, or to the Companys
Knowledge, been threatened, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
that are related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth herein or the
conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or the
remedies available to the parties hereunder; and _provided further_ , that
the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any
information provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.7(a)_.

 

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article IX_ and the Acceptance
Time, Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company (i) upon becoming aware
that any representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub 

 



-62-   in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate, or of any failure of
Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in
each case to the extent such inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be
expected to result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (ii) upon receiving
any notice or other written communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) upon
receiving any notice or other written communication that any Legal Proceedings
have been commenced, or to Parents or Merger Subs knowledge, been
threatened, against Parent or Merger Sub, that are related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that no such
notification shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set forth herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, or the remedies available to the parties
hereunder and _provided further_ , that the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information provided to the
Company pursuant to this _Section 7.7(b)_.

7.8 _Certain Litigation_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and
in writing of any litigation commenced after the date hereof against the
Company or any of its directors by any Company Stockholders (on their own
behalf or on behalf of the Company) relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger) and
shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. The
Company shall control, and shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with
the Company regarding the defense or settlement of any such stockholder
litigation and shall consider Parents views with respect to such stockholder
litigation and shall not settle any such stockholder litigation without the
prior written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed).

7.9 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge
that Parent and the Company have previously executed a Confidentiality
Agreement, dated July 15, 2011, as amended on October 27, 2011 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which will continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.

7.10 _Public Disclosure_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall consult
with each other, and to the extent practicable, agree, before issuing any
press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger), and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except (a) as may be required by
applicable Law or any listing agreement with a national securities exchange,
in which case commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party
hereto shall be made prior to any such release or public statement and (b)
with respect to any press release or other public statement by the Company
permitted by, and in furtherance of the Companys rights under, _Section 7.1_
or _Section 7.2_. The Company and Parent shall work together in good faith
to develop and implement a communications strategy with respect to written and
other communications (including electronic communications) that the Company
proposes to make to its employees regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

7.11 _Employee Matters_.

(a) During the period from the Closing Date until the 12-month anniversary
thereof, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide to each
Person who is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time and who remains in the employment of the Company
and its Subsidiaries on or after the Effective Time (the

 



-63-   " _Continuing Employees_ ") (i) annual base salary in an amount no less than
the amount in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time, (ii) the amount of bonus earned for fiscal year 2012 in
accordance with the Companys bonus plan in effect for such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, which bonus shall be
payable at the time it would otherwise be payable pursuant to such bonus
plan, unless such Continuing Employees employment is terminated by the
Company or such Subsidiary without Cause prior to such time, in which case
such bonus will be payable at the time of such termination and shall be
prorated with respect to the date of such termination and (iii) benefits
(including paid time off, 401(k), health and severance) that are not
materially less favorable (taken as a whole) than those provided to similarly
situated employees of Parent during such period. For purposes of this Section
7.11(a), "Cause" shall be defined and have the meaning accorded to it under
Georgia common law, including but not limited to such Continuing
Employees violation of the Companys Code of Conduct.

(b) The service of each Continuing Employee with the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor employer) prior to the Effective Time
shall be treated, to the extent treated as service by the Company prior to the
Effective Time, as service with Parent and its Subsidiaries for purposes of
each (i) "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA), (ii) "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA), (iii) employment health or medical plan, program, policy or
arrangement, (iv) bonus, incentive or deferred compensation plan, program,
policy or arrangement, or (v) other material compensation or benefit plan,
program, policy or arrangement (each, a " _Parent Benefit Plan_ ") which the
Parent makes available to such Continuing Employee, including for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit levels and accruals (other than benefit
accruals under any tax-qualified retirement plan), but not in any case where
credit would result in duplication of benefits or for purposes of accrual of
pension benefits.

(c) Following the Effective Time, for purposes of each Parent Benefit Plan in
which any Continuing Employee or his or her eligible dependents is eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive any
pre-existing condition, exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting
period to the extent such condition, exclusion, requirement or waiting period
was satisfied or waived under the comparable Employee Plan as of
the Effective Time (or, if later, any applicable plan transaction date) and
(ii) provide full credit for any co-payments, deductibles or similar payments
made or incurred prior to the Effective Time for the plan year in which the
Effective Time (or such transition date) occurs.

(d) The Company shall terminate, effective as of the day immediately preceding
the date the Company becomes a member of the same Controlled Group of
Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent (the "
_401(k) Termination Date_ "), any and all 401(k) plans maintained by the
Company or any ERISA Affiliates, unless Parent provides written notice to the
Company that such 401(k) plan(s) shall not be terminated. The Company shall
provide Parent evidence that the 401(k) plan(s) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company
Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable. The
Company shall also take such other actions in furtherance of terminating any
such 401(k) plans as Parent may reasonably request.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to employ any Continuing Employee for any length of time
following the Closing Date. Subject to

 



-64-   the specific limitations set forth in Section 7.11(a), nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, shall be construed to prevent Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries from (i) terminating, or modifying the terms of employment
of, any Continuing Employee following the Closing Date or (ii) terminating or
modifying to any extent any Parent Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement of the Company or that Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, may establish or
maintain. No covenant or other undertaking in this Agreement shall constitute
an amendment to any employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement,
and any covenant or undertaking that suggests that an employee benefit plan,
program, policy or arrangement will be amended shall be effective only upon
the adoption of a written amendment in accordance with the amendment
procedures of such plan, program, policy or arrangement. The provisions of
this _Section 7.11_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement
and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Continuing Employee), other than the parties hereto and their
respective permitted successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other
rights or remedies under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement. If
a party not entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other
action to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to such
Employee Plan, International Employee Plan or Parent Benefit Plan and that
provision is construed to be such an amendment despite not being explicitly
designated as one in this Agreement, that provision shall lapse retroactively
as of its inception, thereby precluding it from having any amendatory effect.

7.12 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under their respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws
(and other similar organizational documents) and all indemnification
agreements in effect as of the date of this Agreement between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former
directors and officers (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "). In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, for a period of 6 years after the Effective
Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable, with respect to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses of current or former
directors and officers of the Company for periods at or prior to the
Effective Time, than are currently set forth in the Companys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws.

 

(b) For a period of 6 years after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and
officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering each person
covered by the DandO Insurance as of the Effective Time, on terms with respect
to the coverage and amounts no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those of
the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided, however_
, that the Surviving Corporation may, at its option, substitute therefor
policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries containing terms with respect to coverage and amounts no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to such persons than the DandO Insurance, 
_provided further_ , that in satisfying its obligations under this _Section
7.12(b)_ Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay
annual premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for
coverage for its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the " _Maximum
Annual Premium_ ") (which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be
as set forth in _Section 7.12_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule);
_provided_  that that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy

 



-65-   with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum
Annual Premium. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company may purchase with Parents
prior written approval (not to be unreasonably withheld) a six-year "tail"
prepaid policy (the " _Tail Policy_ ") on the DandO Insurance on terms and
conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the DandO Insurance. In
the event that the Company does not purchase the Tail Policy, Parent may
purchase a Tail Policy on the DandO Insurance on terms and conditions no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than the DandO Insurance. In the event that the
Company purchases such a Tail Policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such Tail Policy in full force and
effect and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu
of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the
first sentence of this _Section 7.12(b)_ for so long as such Tail Policy
shall be maintained in full force and effect.

 

(c) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.12_. The obligations under this
_Section 7.12_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party (or any other
person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy
referred to in _Section 7.12(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives))
without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Party or other
person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy
referred to in _Section 7.12(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives). Each
of the Indemnified Parties or other persons who are beneficiaries under the
DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section 7.12(b)_ (and their
heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of
this  _Section 7.12_, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto.
The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries
under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section
7.12(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) under this _Section 7.12_
shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that
such persons may have under the certificate or articles of incorporation,
bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, any and all
indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

 

7.13 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

7.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of Company Shares
(including derivative securities with respect to such shares) that are treated
as dispositions under such rule and result from the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby by each director or officer of the
Company who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company.

 



-66-  ARTICLE VIII

Company to consummate the Merger shall be subject to the satisfaction or

Company Stockholders is required by Delaware Law, the Requisite Stockholder

prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of the Merger or (ii)
issued or granted, any judgment, decree, injunction or other Order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that has the effect of making the Merger
illegal or that has the effect of prohibiting or otherwise preventing the
consummation of the Merger.

hereto, only as follows:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company; or

of the Acceptance Time to have occurred on or before the Termination Date;

_provided, however_ , that a party shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_ if the non-satisfaction of any

performed by such party (or any Affiliate of such party) under this Agreement;
or

(d) by the Company:

(i) if (A) the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub

this Agreement shall have been breached and such breach has a material
adverse effect on Merger Subs ability to purchase and pay for the Company

however_ , that the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 9.1(d)(i)_ on account of such inaccuracy or

satisfied; or (B) the Companys covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement shall have been breached such that the condition set forth in

(x) 30 days following the date that Parent gives the Company notice of such

cured; or

 



-68-  (ii) in the event that any of the following shall have occurred: (A) the

($9,936,145) (the " _Termination Fee Amount_ "), by wire transfer of

Parent, within one Business Day after demand by Parent, in the event that (A)
(1) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section 9.1(b)_ or _Section
9.1(c)_ (in either case, by reason of the failure of the Minimum Condition or
any of the Offer Conditions set forth in clauses (C)(1), (C)(2), (C)(7) or
(C)(8) of Annex A) or (2) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
9.1(e)(i)_, (B) following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
prior to the termination of this Agreement (in the case of any termination

the preceding clause (B)) and such Acquisition Transaction is subsequently
consummated ( _provided_ , _however_ ,

 



-69-   that solely for purposes of this _Section 9.3(b)(i)_, the term "
_Acquisition Transaction_ " shall have the meaning assigned to such term in
_Section 1.1(b)_, except that (x) the references to "20%" shall be deemed to
be references to "35%" and (y) the references to "80%" shall be deemed to be
references to "65%").

 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to

effectiveness of such termination, the Company shall pay to Parent a fee equal
to the Termination Fee Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

 

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to

on more than one occasion.

(c) _Parent Payment_. Parent shall pay the Termination Fee Amount to the
Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or

satisfied and (B) all other conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex A
(other than the Minimum Condition and the eScription Transition Condition,
neither of which shall be required to be satisfied as a condition to payment

(d) _Enforcement_. The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the
provisions of _Section 9.3(b)_ and _(c)_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), and that, without such provisions, neither Parent nor the Company
would have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, (i) if the Company shall
fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_,
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a
judgment against the Company, the Company shall promptly reimburse Parent its
reasonable costs and expenses (including its reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on
the amounts set forth in _Section 9.3(b)_ at the prime rate of Citibank N.A.
in effect on the date such payment was required to be made, and (ii) if Parent
shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to  _Section
9.3(c)_, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company makes a claim that
results in a judgment against Parent, Parent shall promptly reimburse the
Company its reasonable costs and expenses (including its
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in _Section 9.3(c)_ at
the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made. In the event that a party receives a termination fee

liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
such party or any of their respective Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Merger (and the abandonment
thereof) or any matter forming the basis for

 



-70-   such termination, and no party receiving the termination fee, or any of
their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other
claim, action or proceeding against the party paying the fee or any of its
Affiliates arising out of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or any matters forming the basis
for such termination.

 

9.4 _Amendment_. Subject to Law and subject to the other provisions of this
Agreement (including _Section 2.3(c)_), this Agreement may be amended by the
parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company; _provided, however_ ,
that in the event that this Agreement has been adopted by the Company
Stockholders in accordance with Delaware Law, no amendment shall be made to
this Agreement that requires the approval of such Company Stockholders without
such approval.
