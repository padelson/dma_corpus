# **ARTICLE II**

  

# **CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

  

# ** **

  

 **Section 2.1** ** _Conversion of Securities_.** As of the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Sub, the
Company or the holders of any capital stock of the Constituent Corporations:

  



  

### (a) Except as set forth in Section 2.1(b), each issued and outstanding
share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Sub shall be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation outstanding immediately after the
Effective Time.

  



  

### (b) All shares of Company Capital Stock that are held in the treasury
of the Company and any shares of Company Capital Stock owned by Buyer or Sub
or any other Subsidiary of Buyer, direct or indirect, shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no capital stock of Buyer
or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange

  



  

2   

     
   

  



  

### therefor. Shares of Company Capital Stock held by wholly owned
Subsidiaries of the Company shall remain outstanding.

  



  

### (c) At the Effective Time, each then issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares and shares described in
Section 2.1(b)) shall immediately cease to be outstanding, shall
automatically be cancelled and retired, shall cease to exist, and shall be
converted into the right to receive $10.75 in cash, without interest (the "
_Per Common Share Price_ ") to be distributed in accordance with this Section
2.1(c), 2.3, and 2.4.

  



  

### (d) At the Effective Time, each then issued and outstanding share of
Senior Preferred Stock (other than Dissenting Shares and shares described in
Section 2.1(b)) shall immediately cease to be outstanding, shall
automatically be cancelled and retired, shall cease to exist, and shall be
converted into the right to receive $1,320.6386 in cash, without interest,
together with all accrued but unpaid dividends (the " _Per Senior Preferred
Share Price_ ") to be distributed in accordance with this Section 2.1(d),
2.3, and 2.4.

  



  

### (e) At the Effective Time, each then issued and outstanding share of
Series B Preferred Stock (other than Dissenting Shares and shares described
in Section 2.1(b)) shall immediately cease to be outstanding, shall
automatically be cancelled and retired, shall cease to exist, and shall be
converted into the right to receive $1,653.8462 in cash, without interest,
together with all accrued but unpaid dividends (the " _Per Series B Preferred
Share Price_ ") to be distributed in accordance with this Section 2.1(e),
2.3, and 2.4.

  



  

### (f) The aggregate consideration payable by Buyer pursuant to Sections
2.1(c), (d) and (e) is referred to herein as the " _Merger Consideration_ ".
At the Effective Time, each holder of Company Capital Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such issued and outstanding shares (other
than Dissenting Shares) of Company Capital Stock (including, without
limitation, the right to vote), except for the right to receive his, her or
its respective portion of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, then the Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly
adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares.

  



  

 **Section 2.2** ** _Company Stock Options; Warrants_.**

  



  

### (a) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, as of the
Effective Time, each Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately
prior to, and vested as of, the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without further action on the part of Buyer, Sub, the Company or the holder
of that Company Stock Option, shall be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the Option Share
Amount multiplied by (ii) the aggregate number of vested shares of Company
Common Stock into which the applicable Company Stock Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each Company Stock Option, solely
to the extent not vested as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without further action on the part of Buyer, Sub, the Company or the
holder of that Company Stock Option, shall be cancelled and no payment shall
be made with respect to

  



  

3   

     
   

  



  

### such unvested shares of Company Common Stock. The payment of the Option
Share Amount to the holder of a Company Stock Option shall be reduced by any
income or employment Tax withholding required under (A) the Code, or (B) any
applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws. To the extent that any amounts
are withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been
paid to the holder of that Company Stock Option.

  



  

### (b) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, as of the
Effective Time, each Warrant that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested, by virtue of the
Merger and without further action on the part of Buyer, Sub, the Company or
the holder of that Warrant, shall be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (i) the Warrant
Share Amount multiplied by (ii) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Capital Stock into which the applicable Warrant was exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then vested or exercisable by its
terms).  The payment of the Warrant Share Amount to the holder of a Warrant
shall be reduced by any income Tax withholding required under (A) the Code,
or (B) any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Laws. To the extent that
any amounts are withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes as
having been paid to the holder of that Warrant.

  



  

### (c) The " _Option Share Amount_ " means (i) the Per Common Share Price
less (ii) the exercise or purchase price per share of Company Common Stock
subject or related to the applicable Company Stock Option.

  



  

### (d) The " _Warrant Share Amount_ " means (i) $10.75 less (ii) the
exercise or purchase price per share of Company Capital Stock subject or
related to the applicable Warrant.

  



  

### (e) The Company shall take all action reasonably necessary to implement
the provisions of this Section 2.2 and to ensure that no Company Stock Option
shall be exercisable for Company Common Stock, and no Warrant shall be
exercisable for Company Capital Stock, following the Effective Time. At the
Effective Time, all Company Stock Options and Warrants shall be cancelled and
all Company Stock Option Plans shall terminate, and the Company shall take
all actions to ensure that such cancellations and terminations occur.  All
administrative and other rights and authorities granted under any Company
Stock Option Plan to the Company, the board of directors of the Company or
any committee or designee thereof, shall, following the Effective
Time, reside with the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

 **Section 2.3** ** _Payment of Merger Consideration_.**

  



  

### (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall appoint a commercial bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company, as a paying agent (the
" _Paying Agent_ ") for the benefit of the holders of Company Capital Stock
that are not Dissenting Shares and who are entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration (collectively, the " _Holders_ "). At the Effective Time,
Buyer shall make available to the Paying Agent an amount of cash sufficient
to permit payment of the Merger Consideration to the Holders (the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as
directed by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, on a
daily basis, and any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. The Paying Agent shall
exchange the shares of Company

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

### Capital Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms
of this Article II, through such reasonable procedures as the Paying Agent or
Buyer may adopt.

  



  

### (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Buyer or the
Paying Agent shall cause to be mailed to each record holder of a certificate
or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Company Capital Stock converted in the Merger (the " _Certificates_ ") a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon actual
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall contain
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates and
payment of the Merger Consideration). The Paying Agent shall accept such
certificates upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices.  Upon surrender for cancellation to the
Paying Agent of a Certificate held by any Holder, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, the Holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor that amount of cash equal to the
portion of the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Capital Stock
represented by the Certificate. Any Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled.

  



  

### (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amounts shall be payable at the
Effective Time with respect to any Dissenting Shares or any shares of Company
Capital Stock with respect to which dissenters rights have not terminated.
 In the case of Dissenting Shares, payment shall be made in accordance with
Section 2.9 and the DGCL. In the case of any shares of Company Capital Stock
with respect to which dissenters rights have not terminated as of the
Effective Time, if such shares of Company Capital Stock become Dissenting
Shares, payment shall be made in accordance with Section 2.9 and the DGCL,
and if, instead, the dissenters rights with respect to such shares
irrevocably terminate after the Effective Time, such shares of Company
Capital Stock shall be entitled to receive a portion of the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.3.

  



  

### (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
former Holders for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
the Surviving Corporation and any former Holders who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of any portion of the Merger Consideration.  None of
the Paying Agent, Buyer nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder of shares of Company Capital Stock for cash delivered to a public
official in connection herewith pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

  



  

 **Section 2.4** ** _Transfer Taxes; Withholding_.** If any cash is to be
paid to or issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of
cash in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock
such

  



  

5   

     
   

  



  

amounts as Buyer or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or under any provision
of state, local or foreign tax law.  To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Capital Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent and transmitted by Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent to the appropriate taxing authority
with attribution to each specific Holder.

  



  

 **Section 2.5** ** _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.**
All amounts paid to Holders upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Capital Stock
represented by such Certificates.

  



  

 **Section 2.6** ** _Closing of Company Transfer Books_.** At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer
of shares of Company Capital Stock shall thereafter be made on the records of
the Company. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or Buyer, such Certificates shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  



  

 **Section 2.7** ** _Lost Certificates_.** If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, the posting by
such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against them with
respect to such Certificate, the Surviving Corporation will pay in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the amounts to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1.

  



  

 **Section 2.8** ** _Further Assurances_.** If at any time after the
Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or
things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of
record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers,
franchises, properties or assets of either of the Constituent Corporations,
or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their
designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of either of the Constituent Corporations, all such deeds, bills of
sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of
either Constituent Corporation, all such other acts and things as may be
necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving
Corporations right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of such Constituent
Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

 **Section 2.9** ** _Dissenters  Rights_.**

  



  

(a) Shares of Company Capital Stock that have not been voted for approval of
this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and with respect to which a
demand for payment and appraisal has been properly made and perfected in
accordance with Section 262 of the

  



  

6   

     
   

  



  

DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") or shares that have not voted in favor of the
Merger and with respect to which dissenters rights have not terminated, will
not be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation the
portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable with respect to such
shares at or after the Effective Time and the holder thereof shall be
entitled only to such rights are as granted by the DGCL. If a holder of
Dissenting Shares (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") fails to perfect,
withdraws or loses his or her demand for such payment and appraisal or such
Dissenting Shares (or such other shares with respect to which dissenters
rights have not terminated) become ineligible for such payment and appraisal,
then, as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event of withdrawal
or ineligibility, whichever last occurs, such holders Dissenting Shares will
cease to be Dissenting Shares (or, in the case of such other shares, the
dissenters rights shall have terminated) and each share of Company Capital
Stock will be converted into the right to receive, and will be exchangeable
for, the portion of the Merger Consideration into which such Dissenting
Shares would have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1.

  



  

### (b) The Company shall give Buyer and Sub prompt notice of any demand
received by the Company from a holder of Dissenting Shares for appraisal of
shares of Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and
copies of any correspondence received by the Company relating to any such
demand or potential demand, and the Surviving Corporation and Buyer shall
have the right to participate in and, after the Effective Time, to direct,
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demand. The Company
agrees that, except with the prior written consent of Buyer and Sub, or as
required under the DGCL, it will not voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for
appraisal.  Each Dissenting Stockholder who, pursuant to the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment of the value of the
Dissenting Shares will receive payment therefor after the value therefor has
been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions, and any
Merger Consideration that would have been payable with respect to such
Dissenting Shares will be retained by Buyer.

### it is now being conducted. The Company is qualified to transact business
and, where applicable, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
properties owned or leased by it or the nature of the business conducted by

#### (i) any reference to any event, change or effect being "material" with
respect to any entity means an event, change or effect that is material in

Stock in and of itself, (G) any failure, in and of itself, by the Company to
meet internal or other estimates, predictions, projections or forecasts of
revenue, net income or any other measure of financial performance (it being
understood that, with respect to clauses (F) and (G), the facts
or circumstances giving rise or contributing to such change in trading price
or failure to meet estimates or projections may be deemed to constitute, and
shall be taken into account in determining whether there has been, a Material
Adverse Effect), or (H) any act of terrorism, commencement or escalation of
armed hostilities in the U.S. or internationally against U.S. citizens or
facilities in any other country which the Company or its Subsidiaries conduct
business, or any declaration of war against the U.S. by any country in which
the Company or its Subsidiaries conduct business.  Notwithstanding any of
the foregoing, (1) any change, event or occurrence (except with respect to
any data relating solely to the efficacy of Xyrem in the treatment of
fibromyalgia in the Companys pending SXB-26 fibromyalgia proof of principle
clinical trial) which, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the results or prospects of
Xyrem and (2) the approval by the FDA of an ANDA for an AB-rated fomepizole
injection, shall each be deemed to be a Material Adverse Effect.

Except to the extent that information contained in any Company SEC Document
has been revised or superseded by a later Company

12   

     
   

  



  

SEC Document filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof, none of the Company
SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date hereof contain any untrue

### (d) The effectiveness of any additional SEC disclosure requirement
that, as of the date of this Agreement, has been formally proposed that is
not yet in effect, will not lead to any material change in the Companys
disclosures as set forth in the Company SEC Documents.

  



  

### (e) The Company and its Subsidiaries have designed and maintain a

13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the

and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to
the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure, and (B) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the date
hereof, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Companys
Board of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses

are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the

Buyer and Sub a summary of any such disclosure made by management to the
Companys auditors and audit committee since January 1, 2002. The Company has
made available to Buyer and Sub all correspondence between the Company and
its auditors since January 1, 2002.

  



  

 **Section 3.8** ** _Undisclosed Liabilities; Absence of Certain Changes or
Events_.**

  



  

### (a) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has as of the date of this Agreement any
liabilities or obligations (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) of any nature, except liabilities, obligations or contingencies

action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or
arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such Person is or was

respective Subsidiaries, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring,
or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Closing Date, whether

with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or
before the Closing Date; _provided_  that if the aggregate annual premiums

Effective Time.

including, without limitation, Section 203 of the DGCL, is or may become

determining vesting and entitlement to benefits, service with the Company (or
predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides past service credit)
shall be treated as service with Buyer; provided, that such service shall not
be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits or to the extent that such service was not recognized
under the corresponding Company Plan. To the extent required

  



  

38   

     
   

  



  

by applicable Law, Buyer shall cause any and all pre-existing condition (or
actively at work or similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods

(subject in each case to the provisions of Section 6.9(a) above) or to
terminate the employment of any employee of the Company for any reason.

  

###

agreements that are within its control. In the event any portion of the
Financing becomes unavailable in the manner or from the sources contemplated

any such portion from alternative sources on comparable or more favorable
terms in the aggregate to Buyer (as determined in the reasonable judgment of
Buyer). Buyer shall give the Company prompt written notice of (i) any
material breach by any party of the Commitment Letter (or any definitive
agreements entered into pursuant to the Commitment Letter or any replacements
thereof), (ii) any termination of the Commitment Letter or (iii) any exercise
of any "market out" or "material adverse change" conditions contained in the
Commitment Letter (or any replacements thereof).

### (b) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective Representatives to provide, all cooperation
reasonably necessary in connection with the arrangement of the Financing,
including (i) participation in meetings and due diligence sessions and (ii)
the execution and delivery of any commitment or financing letters, pledge and
security documents or other definitive financing documents, or other
requested certificates or documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer
and Sub, and taking such other actions as are reasonably required to be taken
by the Company in the Financing, provided, however, that the terms and
conditions of the Financing may not require the payment of any commitment or
other fees by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the incurrence of
any liabilities by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the
Effective Time and the obligation to make any such payment shall be subject
to the occurrence of the Closing. The Company agrees and acknowledges that
in connection with the obtaining of the Financing and the satisfaction of
the closing conditions thereunder, at the Closing all outstanding
secured indebtedness of the Company will be required to be paid in full, and
all liens in connection therewith released, and

  



  

39   

     
   

  



  

all documents relating to such indebtedness terminated, including without
limitation any secured indebtedness set forth on Section 3.16 of the Company
Disclosure Letter (which the Company represents and warrants is the only
outstanding secured indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries as

instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. No delay on the part of
any party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party
hereto of any right, power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver of any
other right, power or privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or partial

privilege hereunder. Unless otherwise provided, the rights and remedies
herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights
or remedies that the parties hereto may otherwise have at law or in equity.
The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under
