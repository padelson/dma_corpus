  |  

(d)

  |  

by the Seller, if the Purchaser or the Purchaser Parent has breached or failed
to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
would give rise to a failure of any of the Conditions, and (ii) has not been
or is incapable of being cured by the Purchaser or the Purchaser Parent within
20 Business Days after its receipt of written notice thereof from the Seller,
and the relevant Condition is not waived by the Purchaser; and

Notwithstanding anything else contained in this agreement, the right to
terminate this agreement under clause 4.4 shall not be available to any party

4.6

  |  

The Purchaser may, in its sole and absolute discretion, by written notice to

---|--- 
 

  

  

    

8.5

  |  

The Seller\'s Warranties (other than the Fundamental Warranties), and the

with respect to ownership and/or disposal of Shares in the Company pursuant to
this agreement or prior to the date of this agreement, and (ii) to the extent
required by applicable Laws or Regulatory Requirements pay as soon as
reasonably practicable when due and payable (after exhaustion of all rights of

taxes to the appropriate tax authorities in the PRC. In connection with such
filing and taxes, as well as any submissions, disclosures, negotiations,
settlements, compromises or other resolutions or agreements relating thereto,
the Seller and its representatives will take the lead and, in the Seller\'s
discretion, make all determinations relating thereto (including with respect
to all positions on, or characterisations of, any payments made to the Seller
pursuant to this agreement), and the Purchaser will provide all reasonable and
good faith cooperation and support therefor on a prompt basis, including
executing and delivering any certifications or agreements relating thereto,
subject to the Seller\'s obligation to pay such taxes as provided above. The
Purchaser agrees that any deductions or other tax benefits associated with

cooperation and support, including using its best efforts to ensure that the
Company, each other Wider Group Company and their respective directors,
officers and employees shall continue to promptly furnish to the Seller all
reasonably requested financial and other relevant information to enable the
Seller to respond to any tax assessments resulting from such filings
(including disputing the same if applicable) and pay any amounts owing by the

proceeds an amount of HK$590,954,000 subject to an escrow, separate account or
similar arrangement and pursuant to such agreements as are consistent with
applicable Laws or Regulatory Requirements and market practices and otherwise
reasonably satisfactory to both the Purchaser and the Seller. Interest or
other earnings in relation to such amount will be paid to and for the benefit
of the Seller. Such escrow or other account will provide that the funds
therein will be utilisable to pay taxes assessed to be payable by the Seller
pursuant to clause 8.6, and otherwise will be utilisable to pay and satisfy
any or all obligations and liabilities of the Seller under this agreement (in
each case) for twelve months following the Completion Date, such that, upon
the expiration of such twelve months, the remaining amounts, if any, therein
will be distributed to the Seller as provided below. Such escrow will further
provide that the Seller may satisfy such tax and other obligations or
liabilities of the Seller from such escrow or other account, and that the
Purchaser may, prior to the expiration of such twelve months, make a
reasonable and good faith claim in accordance with this agreement against such
escrow or other account. Following Completion, such escrow or other account
and the amounts deposited therein will be the sole and exclusive source of
recovery, remedy, releases or claim by or on behalf of the Purchaser in
relation to claims under this agreement having regard to the limitations set
out in the schedule headed "Limits on Claims". Notwithstanding such
limitation, the Purchaser acknowledges that (i) to the extent the Seller is
required to make any payments in relation to its obligations under clause 8.6,
the Seller shall be entitled to use the funds deposited in such escrow or
other account, regardless of any claim of which the Purchaser may have
notified the Seller, (ii) the Seller shall be entitled to remove funds from
such account unconditionally to the extent such removed funds are used to
satisfy any obligation of the Seller pursuant to clause 8.6 (or to reimburse
the Seller for any payment already made by the Seller in connection with its
obligations under clause 8.6), provided that the Seller shall deliver to the
Purchaser reasonable documentary evidence of any such obligations and/or
payments 2 Business Days prior to any removal of funds, and (iii) the Seller
expects to distribute or otherwise transfer the Purchase Price to the
Seller\'s equityholders subject to such escrow or other account, as well as
any amounts distributed to it pursuant to such escrow or other account, and,
following such distributions, the Seller expects to liquidate and dissolve.

ownership and/or disposal of Shares on or prior to the Completion Date. All
